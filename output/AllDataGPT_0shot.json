Needless to say, there's now a real sense of commotion and frustration as each party tries desperately to come up with an acceptable solution that works both for them and those around them.",

It's not like anyone ever told me how gorgeous he actually was before (according to everyone around us), but somehow deep down inside I knew he must be even more incredible than everyone else appeared on TV.",

Lapid couldn't believe it; at seventy eight years old Temeria - the only living relative left behind across six brothers and sisters - had granted him an audience with her highest court decisions.",
