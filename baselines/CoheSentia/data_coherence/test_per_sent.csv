Nowadays, there is more and more pollution in the air. In fact, governments and ecologists do their best to eliminate that problem. Because cars are one of the biggest problems with pollution's creation that damage our environment, it will be forbidden in the next future to drive cars. Pollution destroys our Earth and kills about 100 species of animals everyday. Moreover, the climate on the Earth changes dramatically, as a result, our flora and fauna are destroyed. Here are some reasons that show that in twenty years, cars won't exist anymore, because of this problem of pollution creation. Another reason is that before twenty years, new methods of transportation will be invented. As stated in the first paragraph, cars produce too much pollution. In fact, some people will create a revolutionary method of transportation with an engine carrying water or sunlight, instead of gas.

246,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I'm absolutely agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Travel in a group can solve the problem of boredom because you can talk to people who share your common interests as you are. Furthermore,travel in a group will be more secure rather than travel alone especially to those chaotic areas in the destination. And travelling in a group led by a tour guide will reduce the rate of missing famous places and worth seeing scenery. Because a guide knows the place well and he knows at which season,at what time,where the place is beautiful and he can also lead tourists to visit avoid the peak time which is very convenient for tourists. Then, travelling in a group can make a lot of friends during the vacation and can enhance the relationships. OUr human beings are not isolated ones,we need to communicate.

Keep in mind that lots of experiments that the scientists did, they already had mistakes with them but they tried it again and again. Eventually, they got accepted because they did not give up or they said it was difficult. People should pay attention to what is going on around them in this world. Lots of famous people make mistakes but they are successful. They are successful because they made a mistake and they also learned from the mistake.

Some people prefer travelling that is in groups and is led by a guide, and would like to put an end to it, while others do not think this is the best way. As far as I am concerned, I contend that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. The reasons supporting my assertion will be shown below. First of all, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun. Both common sense and our experience have informed us that if many people stay together, they will be happier and can have more fun. For example, when we travel in a group, we can share our funny stories, chat with one another, and even play some interesting games. All these activities help us to spend the boring time on the bus or the train. And also, the guide can tell us some interesting local customs which we enjoy. In addition, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is safer. It is well known that thieves usually attack people alone, which situation is easier for them. While if the tourists are in a group, we can look after one another, and can also take care of the belongings when some people go to the washroom. And also, there are some dangers in some resorts, which the guide knows well. In this situation, the guide will remind us to be careful. Moreover, travelling in a group led by a tour guide makes us know more about the local culture. We know that the guide is professional and gets good training about the resorts that we visit. At each resort, the guide will explain the history of it, and even give some information we can not get from the guide book. Thus the explanation made by the guide makes our tourists more efficient. Notwithstanding the fact that travelling in a group led by a guide is noisier, this demerit can be compensated for by the many merits associated with group travelling. Beyond doubt, when the facts are examined, their advantages and disadvantages weighed, and biased opinions cast away,it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that travelling in a group led by a guide is the best way to travel.', 'Given the practical realities of modern society, in fact, not only do I prefer the safety, fun, and knowledge brought about by group travel, but also I hope that the group members can be quiet some time when some people are tired.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

Firstly, it is true that normal people do normal things, live normal lives and love normal things. According to speaking of successful people, however, they were willing to take risks to succeed. People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes something needs to be changed. We should create new things that will make us live new lives and better lives. Secondly, maybe all of us know 'life is a venture'. It is such a famous sentence that we could hear before. But the case that it comes true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake by trying new ventures. But I think avoiding ventures to keep them from failing is the worst thing in your whole lives. You don't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new. It will give you an experience. This invaluable experience will help you to succeed at other things. It is so valuable that you may not want to change to other things. In conclusion, there are a number of opportunities in the world. Some people can see and grasp these possibilities, but others can't see that they will miss these things. You have to take these opportunities in your life. In this modern society, it is so important to be a creative person. Society wants that kind of person, so we should have courage and keep going to the new things.","[""Do you want to live a successful life?

Here are some reasons. First of all, there are fewer rivals for new things. For example, there were already lots of coffee shops. So many investors struggled to make extraordinary shops. And they also have to care about the location of the shop and the menu. Because there are rival shops. But if someone tries a new thing, he doesn't have to worry about the rival. As I stated about Bill gates, when the new company developed new things, there were no rivals. They didn't worry about challenging other companies. So Bill gates concentrated on his new things. Secondly, only doing what they already know how to do well is more dangerous than trying new things. As age has changed, important things have changed. For example, a long time ago, laundry was very important. Because the laundry machine was expensive and hard to manage. So many people use a laundry shop.

But when you get in a more deeper conversation or when you are trying to apply your knowledge in the real world or in the real situations that work can give you, you can get confused or maybe you can't seem to find the answer to a specific question in a requested field. When you get specialized in one specific subject you may not know a lot of things about everything, but when it comes to your field of work you will be the only one who knows everything about it, from A to Z. For example, in a soccer team you can not be the goalie, a defender , or all the players at the same time. Everyone has their exact position on the field, and everyone has their own chores during a game. Each and everyone makes a team, not just one player who knows it all, but the fusion between all the players into one team is the one who leads to winning games and to having a great team. In conclusion, I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to know a little about every subject."", 'Speaking about our own fields of study, everyone should know more about a specific thing and make a team, in everything we do at work, with the other players to make a winning and a strong team.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

To start with,we have to know that the resources of energy have been developed through the last decades. First,people relied on themselves for transportation then they began to depend on animals like horses and camels. Then more resources began to appear like the resources of steam energy which could be developed after the appearance of the cook. Then the development continued until the finding of the petrolum. Then the activity of this type spreads alot and continues till now in its growth. The oil (a part of the petrolum components) drived alot of fields in the improving and developing of cars' inventions. The manufacturing process of cars is now one of the biggest industries in the world. That oil has become available in many countries and there is a good reserve for it. Also,the iron factories which become more advanced and have the ability to provide large amounts of it for the process. Indeed, high technology has appeared in recent years in the field of improving the characteristics of materials used in the industry which helps to invent new ones which can bear the impacts well and have small weight. In fact,this process is in conjunction with the development of materials in the industry that it makes the reduction of impairments in many materials increase their quality and decrease their costs. These factors affected the manufacturing process of cars and lead to a lot of cars and with different technologies and models. Also,the cars available now have a high range of costs which are suitable for many people to have one of them. Finally,we see the development of energy resources and the appearance of a new one by the petrolum. This new type affects the manufacturing of cars since it is available in many places and with large amounts. Also,the enhancements happened for the manufacturing of iron and the characteristics of materials used in the body of cars. Also,we see the effect which leads to having a lot of cars with considerable costs so many people could have one and then the number of cars increased.","[""I agree with this statement that cars are now used more than last and with big numbers.

If you are young that means your body lets you do a lot of things that you want to. Because you have more energy. You can do sports,go out with your girlfriend,go to a lot of entertainment etc. You can do whatever you want illegally. And all of these makes you happy. Also young people do not have much responsibility. And they feel life is endless. When you get older the taste that you get from life chances. If you have a wife that you love,if you have good sons and daughters you are the most happy person in the world. You get happy with the good things that happen to your sons or daughters. Your vife ` s worm hand makes you happy. Besides all of these if you have grandchildren and if they like you that makes youhappier. Maybe you did not have the same energy as you were young but now you have more reasons to feelhappy. So we can not say young people enjoy life more than older people and we can not say older people enjoy life more than young people. Every age has its own beauty. Everything is in your brain,if you teach it to enjoy life it always enjoys life in every age.', 'So be honest with yourself whatever your age, raising your head you can see a lot of things that will make youhappy,.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

It's true that trying new things is not simple but I think that a person can search for the best everytime and everywhere to enlarge his success. We don't have many good things if the same brave people don't try to do that and don't take the risks for their actions.","[""I agree with the statement but I don't think that this idea is good. Successful people don't try new things and don't take risks because they don't want to make a wrong impression on other people. In fact the success of a person is due to other people's ideas and other people's impressions , and a person that just has success does n't want to destroy it. In accord to that a successful person does n't take a choice that is not sure, and does n't take an action that can ruin his position. That is not bad in any way. In fact in modern times is very difficult to have success and it is not easy to take a decision that can change all that you do in your life. But on the other hand, if you don't take risks you can not grow your success, that because when you try new things you take the same risks but on the other hand if the new things are good your success can becomebigger than before. At the start of a life a person doesn't have success yet, only during life does your action make your success. Successful people in the past took risks to have success.
