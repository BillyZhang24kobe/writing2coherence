1795364.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","With the rashly development of the automobile industries in the 1950's the use of cars increased exorbitantly. By the following years to date most households have at least one car or sometimes more than that. After this explosive growth in applying a car the awareness of polluting and damaging the environment is also increasing. This has been happening in the 1960's when the hippie movement was at its peak. This means that up from then, people began to think about the consequences of using a car and particularly using a car for movement for which a car isn't necessary. They also started to consider what kind of aftermath their behavior would have for their children and the children of their children. They recognize the impact of using a car for the environment, for example they receive that the high use of pollutants like cars can be harmful for the ozone layer. The turnover of conduct and so the try to treat the environment more carefully can also be found in many political strategies or in new laws for protecting the environment.

622011.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work. Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them. In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures. A person has to love his work to create new things and to succeed indeed. By taking risks you learn new useful things that help you in your life.

1738687.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I think most advertisements are made to look the products much better than they really are. They make the ad or TV commercials intentionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain point of products. A typical example is, I think, the advertisements for cars. One commercial that I felt like I missed the point of was the one where a man at the grocery cashier looks at what he was going to buy and what the other man is going to. He got vegetables and a pack of big in Tofu in his cart and the other man had a huge bulk of beef. After that he rushes into a car dealership and buys a big car. An impression that I had of this TV commercial is, ""Get a big car, get your dignity. ""But the car eats gas like a monster. These days, especially after the Middle-east crisis, gas efficiency is one of the most important elements when you choose which car you purchase. More people are concerned about efficiency much more than they used to be before.

1228978.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although some people believe that young people enjoy life more than old people do, I do not agree with this statement. However, from my point of view, I believe that enjoyment is not related any more to the age of people. So many reasons can support my point of view. In this life, there are many things that people can enjoy. These than are different from people to other. For example, children will enjoy playing computer games. but, when they become a little older they will enjoy other things like playing football. By the years, their way of entertainment will vary according to their ages. another reason that supports my opinion is the different circumstances for people. some people were sad during their youth and become happy when they are oled and vice versa for other people. this is because of the surrounding environment.","On the other hand, some people believe that young people enjoy life more than old people do.",0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"On the other hand, some people argue that young people enjoy life more than old people do, but I still believe that enjoyment is not related to age."

Or, should we stick to what we know how to do best? Don't we have an intrinsic curiosity? So, what makes us frightened to try new things or should we be brave enough to choose not to do what we already know best? Could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing? As a successful commander Sir Winston Churchill has a saying: ""The first of all values of man is courage"". I agree that in order to be successful people should be brave and try new things.

1226973.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good. However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons. First of all, most students learn a lot of subjects in school and have exams in each semester. However, it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part. For example, I learned many subjects from academic institutions such as history, nuclear  physics, and pantam physics. But i am the president of an online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me.

527417.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""Young people enjoy life more than older people do. ""This statement might sound true because it is commonly known that a joyfulsoul and a young heart exist in a young body. But i have personally an objection to both statements: a young heart can still exist in old bodies if one knows how to enjoy his life and make himself happy. An old person should convince herself that she is not a teenager anymore and that she cannot do the things she used to do when she was young. This way this old person would adapt to her situation and try to accomodate the things she is able to do in her ongoing life. Many activities can fulfil the life of an old person and steel away the feeling of getting board. A few examples may support my disagreement with the stated subject: By reading , doing sports if possible, helping people, a person may still find herself useful to society. This feeling breaks away sadness and unhappy memories. By working as a volunteer if possible, someone may feel that he is really helping instead of spending the day wondering what to do. Grandkids, most of the time love to stay with their grandparents and listen to stories from the past.

Turning to the statements that should be claimed, one informative example is doctors, having a complete knowledge of all the academic subjects such as anatomy and many more , will improve the jr. docters to perform the operation on the human bodies, because all the people going to the doctor will have complete credibility on them that the doctors cure their illness , there is no exaggeration that if the anesthesiologist performs an eye operation he will be perfectly perfect in all the organs functioning such as brain, nerves etc.",so a doctor should be well practiced with his academic subjects.,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Therefore, a doctor should be well practiced with his academic subjects."
894771.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In general, many people think young people enjoy life more than older people do. I agree with this statement in terms of young men's advantages. There are three main reasons that my ideas support effectively, like action, study and knowledge. First of all, I wanna introduce young people's active points in comparison with older people. Of course, there are many older people that are active or powerful. I, however, think in terms of physical and mental factors young people are superior to older people. For example, in the case of sports young people can run and jump, and they can train their muscles that are used in each sport such as transitional sports or silence sports. Then, I wanna indicate that young people can study many things that are interesting or exciting things for young people. About students, they can learn various fields that students want to study. By doing so, students grow up with predijous. Finally, I wanna state that young people can acquire many kinds of knowledge from older people.

In my opinion, we can use the internet to do many things, It is more convenient to travel around, and in the city, you can use buses or subway to go to anyplace you want. First of all, we can use the internet to do many things. For instance, people in the feature will work at home and use the internet to do their job. Students don't go to school anymore, because they use the internet to complete the group discussion, or find something about the assignment from a teacher who teaches them through the internet. In addition, it is more convenient to travel around by train or airplane. The train or airplane will be improved. For example, the price of the train and airplane will be very low, Does anyone want to drive by himself or herself or herself? taking the train or airplane is more efficient than driving your own car. Finally, in the city, you can use a bus or subway to go to anyplace you want. If you own a car, you will pay huge taxes on the car, and drive it out a few times. It was a waste of money. the money should be used in other better ways. Furthermore, in japan, they usually go to the train station by bicycle, it is very convenient less polluting , and good for your health. In summary, we can use the internet to do many things. Moreover, it is more convenient to travel around by train than by airplane. Finally, you can go to anyplace by bus or subway.

663817.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the statement. An elaborate analysis of the reasons in favour of and against the notion would clarify my stand and help us develop a better understanding of the concept. Some would say that the young generation is money oriented and is involved in selfish deeds. But the point to be considered here is that these money oriented youngsters contribute to the formation of a strong world economic backbone.

1578728.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Do you have more pleasure when you were a kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious. We will see that being young provides less responsibility, more time and places to socialize and better health to enjoy life. The biggest difference between older and younger people is that the young ones have fewer sorrows. Children and teenagers don't have to worry about money, their parents do. They also don't need to worry about cleaning the house, buying food, it is also their parents' job. The lack of responsibility enables us to focus on other things in life: having fun. School is not only a place to study, it is also the best place to make friends. Courses and breaks are special opportunities to discover new people and socialize with them. During all the studies, a student will meet more people than he can ever in his grown up, office life. Old people also have other concerns.

608718.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,Conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they haven't had too many sad experiences yet. I think that it is ironic since most people want to live longer. But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger. First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people.

283858.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Helping the community you live in, does not necessarily mean to allot more time helping the older people or reading to the blind. There are also indirect ways that young people will contribute to their community. These indirect ways may seem inmeasurable in the first place, but actually they are more contributing than any other means of direct help. Young people spend most of their time doing popular things such as dancing, singing even playing video games. But popular things arouse the interest of the community which makes them profitable for the mass media. And therefore singing. dancing and even video games are shown on TVs. This contest enables young people to become celebrities only by excelling at the popular things that they like. Celerities bring many contributions to where they live. People visit the places where a famous celebrity was born. As  a result of this touristic attraction the local economy will boost and bring new job opportunities to the community. Moreover spending more time on individual development rather than on social contributions to the community will enable young people to become more capable and respected individuals in the future. If young people direct their energy to intellectual excellence they will cultivate a better future for both them selves and the community they live in. The contribution a young person may do is very limited when compared to a rich, respected and powerful person who can do who is willing to help his society.","To sum up, young people should do their best to become someone in the first place so that they will also help their community.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"To sum up, young people should do their best to become someone important in the first place so that they will also help their community."

Young people are physically healthier and have more energy than older people. People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do.

This, i believe is caused by the environment we live in. However, this is not a problem that is only limited to the young developing generation. I think that the adults that are living right now are also guilty of this problem. It is our whole population that is causing this problem. By "" our"" i mean to refer to the people who live in developed countries and have a high standard of living compared to the developing nations. In war times, we did not have enough food supplies, not enough houses, not enough water, not anything of any abundance then the surrounding fear and death.

Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky.

1142118.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In many situations, as human beings, people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occur once in a while. Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step to leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into a --- normal person. From not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life. To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But, when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists? This is because of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus, finally he got the Nobel prize for his achievements. Not only, will he be remembered but his work of investment and achievement on the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of society.

1513527.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies.

And it is right, in a certain way. In fact, our society shows admiration for these kinds of people. But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank.

1130325.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly believe the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Understanding the idea is more important for every student in the class room. the understanding of the ideas and concepts gives the overall picture of that particular lecture. for example in my college days i concentrated more on my lessons ,at that time i knew the central idea of the topic. This type of skills will improve the ability to study and the ability to remember. These skills also reduce the study time. the students can learn more in a format quickly. Learning facts is good but every time we dont want to study. We dont want to sparemuch time on learningfacts. At that time these skills are very helpful. It is a very time consuming process. Understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful any time. for example i want to go to anexam ,first i will go through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and the concept of that one. I regularly follow this rule of studying. So in this way i get more information in time ,i save my time also. In this way, I am studying hard to get good marks in my exams.

I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands.

1928452.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially those who would like to make a success in their life, discuss whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just keep what they already have a knowledge to make a better life. I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life. For example, the SamSung company which is specialized in the electronic field such as TV, computers and semiconductor products worldwide has been researching new markets and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result, it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people. If the company still enjoyed stability, today's successful story would not exist. Further more, the companies which exploit the well of crude oil always try to find new resources by investing large amounts of money with huge risks. For these efforts, it deserved to get a lot of reputation and accumulate a fortune. Secondly, stability of today's life means returning to the past in this capitalism. Everyday, new information is revealed to the public and every individual must have a radar to catch it.","For example, the auto maker company tries to new design to meet the customers' needs in the market However, they do not make an effort to make a new design of cars, the company will lose the people's consumption.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, the auto maker company tries new designs to meet the customers' needs in the market.

901198.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although both young and older people can live a fascinating life, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people. This may be because young people have wonderful dreams about life, they are healthier, and finally, they have less responsibilities. Having dreams and aims is one of the most important things that make young people more enjoyable in life. Young people have many goals that they want to achieve, for example they want to achieve good education, a high position. Also, they dream of a wonderful wife/husband and a happy life, and they make their best efforts to achieve these dreams. Expecting and anticipation of a better future is a main source of happiness. Some, may argue that older people also have dreams and goals, but ,in my opinion, they face and experience real life which may be hard and disappointing. Another factor is, health is very important to enjoy life. When you are in good health, you can do any thing. You can make any effort you want, any kind of sport, any activity. Illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy. When you are ill, you should take care of your health; you should not do any hard activity, any excessive exertion, and can only do some kinds of sports.","You have to take care of times of different medicines, and see the doctor regularly, and so on.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, you have to take care of times of different medicines, and see the doctor regularly, and so on."
1254807.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people feel life inside, while old people lose their energy. This is the main difference i think. An old man has a lot of experience inside him; he could feel tired sometimes: things aren't even more new, they don't communicate the same sensation they were used to doing in the past. In fact a young person knows that he has a whole life to live. He enjoys living looking at the future, while an old man lives looking at what he has lived in the past. A young person has the opportunity to create his future by catching each single sensation coming from the outside (the world). A baby is used to enjoying everything because everything is new; a very old person may feel like he has no more reason to live, and so his life becomes something like ""Waiting for Godot"", waiting for something to try to find some distraction to spend life. We have to underline that physical condition is essential for enjoying life too: normally young people feel better so they can do a lot of things that old people can't, like sport, which presents an important way to satisfy ourselves.",The preoccupation with health is another main attitude that contributes to making old people live in fear.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Additionally, the preoccupation with health is another main attitude that contributes to making old people live in fear."

From my point of view, I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones because they have all the abilities, health, and energy to enjoy life. The first reason I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones is because they have the motivation towards life, and life without motivation is like a car without oil. For example a young person will work hard towards improving his job description, or his capabilities, and from my point of view this is an enjoyableexperience. Whereas, an older age person does not have the motivation or energy to achieve any of his remaining goals.
