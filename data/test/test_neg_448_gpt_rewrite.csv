982338.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although it totally depends on how a person looks at his or her life to say he or she is enjoying his or her life, from my experience as a man who just turned 31, I disagree with this statement. As far as I am concerned, older people can have more chances or times to enjoy their lives and more of them might already have got great memories that can last until the last day of their lives. I believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do for the following a few reasons. First of all, most of those 'older people' are assumed to have retired or to be in the near future which means they already have enough money in their savings or other investment portfolio to live without working for the last of times. It is not unusual to see those older people who are doing all the fun stuff they could not or have put off for a long time. It is possible for them to enjoy their lives because they worked or have been working for such a long time preparing for retirement. Also, since most older people do not have to work to support their own family by the time of retirement, there is not much time for them to get stressed.",It leads them to more enjoyable moments they have wished for.,-1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Therefore, it leads them to more enjoyable moments they have wished for."

593292.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that ''most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are''. Usually the products in the advertisements are shown to be more good looking,elegant,tasty,good texture,and all the higher qualities, for which most of the time they don't possess all those qualities. For example take an advertisement forsuiting and shirtings,the dress they show seems to be very beautiful and attractive,elegantly coloured, but the same when you see it truely may not be so good,the stitching may not be so perfect ,the colour shades may not be appropriate and it may not fit well. The other example, if we take the advertisements regarding food products ,they show them to be very tasty and delicious and they also show that they can be prepared within a few minutes,but actually when we really taste them they may not be that delicious,or it may even take a long time to prepare them. Even the advertisements for various medical products show that the medicine works really faster ,in a more efficient way,and they show all the things that make us appeal that the product is of superior quality,but in reality they may be associated with various side effects and may act differently on different individuals or even the costs may be higher. For example once i was watching an advertisement on the television which was about equipment for reducing weight. The advertisement said that we got to workout only for 15minutes on that equipment and no diet necessary and it would make you lose about 5 pounds per week,and even though they were showing some of the people and their experiences who used that product and by looking at all those i was so tempted to buy the product and ordered it,but once when i got the product and started using it for afew days,i couldn't see any loss in my weight but i also noticed knee pain problems by using that equipment.","So,with that i clearly came to know that I never believed in advertisements as they usually make the products seem better than they really are to increase their sales.",-1.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"So, with that experience, I clearly came to know that I should never believe in advertisements as they usually make the products seem better than they really are to increase their sales."

1799186.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I stand behind the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. There are three reasons: changed society, health and the internet. First, comparing it to some decades before to the present, society has completely changed. Old timers spent time on themselves to live somehow to earn as much money as possible when they were young. However, young people these days are given almost any goods which are essential for everyday life when they are born. Therefore, young people can spend their time enjoying themselves. Secondly, although in order to enjoy life, people should be healthy, older people are more likely not to be healthy than young people. If they are sick, even if they are very optimistic people, it is usually hard for people to enjoy their life enough. Lastly, in present circumstances, in order to enjoy this worldwide and borderless society, people need to operate a computer and use an internet service enough. To operate a computer is a kind of hard for older people. For instance, my father who is 65 years old can only type with his right hand so he spends a lot of time operatinga computer. Also on the occasion of the computer being crushed, my father, one of the older people, couldn't solve the situation. On the other hand, young people are more used to using a computer and know much about it and the Internet.","In their age, computers have no more complicated material than mere everyday staff like a microwave.",-1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"In their age, computers are no more complicated than everyday items like a microwave."

121551.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people might say that learning facts is important for students without understanding ideas and conceps because the way is more convincing to grasp some knowledge. However, I believe that understanding ideas and concepts process is more important for students to learn something because of several reasons. First of all, understanding ideas makes students not lose the ideas easily. without understanding means students study not deeply because if they study to get more reasons and information, they will be able to understand and not to forget it easily. For example, when i was a high school student, I learned about my country's history. My teacher let us know just the history's facts, and it was too difficult to understand. Although i got a high score in the class, I cannot now remember anything because I couldn't really get it without understanding. If my teacher and I had tried to understand about my country's history, I would have explained about that fluently. Another reason I believe students need to understand concepts is that knowing the studies' concepts helps students to study the course comfortably. If you go some where without knowing the direction, do you feel comfortable? I don't think so because unknowing where we are going makes people feel frustrated and lose confidence.","According to the news I've watched, 45% of students who know about the taking course's conceptby teacher's explainations show higher achievements from the course in that they can know what the course is going on.",-1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"According to the news I've watched, 45% of students who understand the course's concepts through their teacher's explanations show higher achievements because they know what the course is about."

Another thing is that concentration is the most important factor in order for a person to be successful otherwise as a human being he will get lost and will not have a clear idea about what he is hoping to be.",As a society we are a number of people and each one has to dump a certain gap in order to be a good society and to achieve our goals as one society which follows in achieving our goals as one person in a society.,-1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Therefore, as a society, we are a number of people, and each one has to fill a certain gap in order to be a good society and to achieve our goals as one society, which follows in achieving our goals as one person in a society."

In my opinion, I do not agree with this statement, but I do not either disagree with it. First of all, I think that it is better to be specialized in one specific subject, because if you learn too many different subjects at the same time you will be confused, and instead of learning a lot of things you will not learn anything. I also think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because you will learn a lot about the subject, you will be taught everything you have to know about it, and you will know all its different characteristics. For example, if you arrive at university and you choose to learn economics sciences, I think it is better to take different courses related to it than to take, for example, one italian class, one class in modern art and so on. that are not related together. In that way you will learn everything you have to know about economics.","Anyway, I do not totally agree with the statement.",-1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"However, I do not totally agree with the statement."

470830.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that young people do not give time to help their communities. Recently, the world has become very busy and society has changed drastically compared to 50 years ago. There are two main reasons which prevent young people from helping their communities. First of all, young people become very busy, they can not spend enough time in their community. For example, nowadays, young people go to not only school for studying but also private schools. Around 75% of junior high school and high school students in Tokyo, Japan go to private school twice a week till night. In this situation, it is very difficult for students and young people to spare the time in their community. Moreover, young people's lives have been changed. They play with their friends in the city not only in their community. The city has been developed, and there are many entertainments, such as movies, internet cafes, and shopping buildings.

Nobody in the community does not care about local activities any more. 50 years ago, there were alot of local events and meetings in the community in even the Tokyo area. One of the reasons for this is that alot of people are moving in and out of Tokyo because of their studies and work, and people do not settle down. Thus nobody will take care of local activities. On the otherhand, young people in the suburbs tend to move out to big cities for study and work and come back several years later, and naturally, they cannot join or help their communities.","In conclusion, I support that young people thesedays don't give enough time to help their communities because of luck of time and change of community.",-1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"In conclusion, I support that young people these days don't give enough time to help their communities because of lack of time and changes in the community."

Some of them learn from facts, but most of them learn from ideas and concepts. Most of the time the facts can be difficult to understand. Teachers can teach the students the basic ideas and the concepts in order to understand easily and quickly.

147680.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"The issue at hand is , whether it is good to travel alone without a tour guide or in a group that is led by a tour guide. This issue is very troubling to me because there are so many people in the world who enjoy going to different places by themselves without a tour guide although they can afford one. But i'll support the tour with a guide with a group of people because sometimes you can find many good life long friends in a group and many beautiful scenery that you cannot see without the help of a tour guide. The best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guide because a tour guide can give you a lot of information about the places you are going to see. You cannot find that information if you are travelling alone without a guide. Moreover, if you are travelling in a group you will actually enjoy the travelling & you will not even know about the time that you spenttravelling. On the other hand,if you are travelling alone without a tour you can cause trouble for yourself sometimes.","For example, you cannot find all the sight sceneries without a tour guide & it will be a great hassle if you are travelling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting.",-1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"For example, you cannot find all the scenic sights without a tour guide, and it will be a great hassle if you are traveling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting."

For example, you cannot find all the sight sceneries without a tour guide & it will be a great hassle if you are travelling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting. The second reason why a group travelling with a guide is preferable is because of the economic figures. For example,suppose you are travelling alone without a guide it will cause you to spend a lot of money if you don't know the visiting city well. On the other hand,in a group tour all the participants pool money so that every individual has to pay a little amount of money. Furthermore, travelling with a group of people can enjoy their travelling a lot instead of a single individual. In conclusion , i'll say that travelling in a group is a far more exciting experience than travelling alone without a guide.","I believe this is the best option because it is economical,exciting, and worth spending money travelling with a bunch of people rather than alone.",-1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I believe this is the best option because it is economical, exciting, and worth spending money travelling with a bunch of people rather than alone."
1722916.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","This can be true or false. It depends on how you see it. You might think that in a few years' time cars will disappear because we will use other kinds of transport such as trains or planes to travel far away or the bus and the bicycle to go around the city. Nowadays more and more people are concerned with the environment so in my opinion, there will be a large increase in the number of people who will use other kinds of transport in the state of cars. On the other hand, it is true that sometimes it is the most cheaper, comfortable and quicker way to travel because you can take it when ever you want, with the people you want and go exactly to the place you want to go. For these reasons I think there won't be fewer cars in twenty years'time. Now I am studying to have my driving licence and there are a lot of people like me because it has been a thing that everybody needs not only to go on big trips but also to go to work or to university when you don't have buses. To conclude I will say that the thing I suppose is going to happen is that people will continue using their cars like today or more but the cars will be environmentally friendly so they will consume less petrol than now or they won't consume it.

I believe and an example of this is the founder of Microsot. He invented a new operational system for computers called windows, back in the 1990s. I don't think he just created the most important company in the world by trying a new thing and taking the risk of putting some money into that business. What I believe is that he really knew exactly how to change the computer world by adding a new friendly user interface to Personal Computers (PCs), and he anticipated the impact that PCs would have on the life of the human race. Also, Microsoft's founder has been able to be successful managing his company for the last 27 years, beyond the most furious market competition from their rivals (Apple, IBM and others).","If someone suddenly changes jobs or follows a new idea, and from being a financial advisor, he switches to the pizza business and invests all his savings in this new business, and suddenly he becomes the most famous pizza chef in the world and makes a lot of money, i would call this person luccky.",-1.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"However, if someone suddenly changes jobs or follows a new idea, and from being a financial advisor, he switches to the pizza business and invests all his savings in this new business, and suddenly he becomes the most famous pizza chef in the world and makes a lot of money, I would call this person lucky."

1286790.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I definitely disagree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because I know that a lot of young people work for their communities as volunteers. I would like to offer some examples to support my opinion. First, there are a large number of students at my university who are interested in helping their communities. For example, when I went to the volunteer meeting at the university a few days ago ,although it was still on summer vacation, the meeting room was packed with students who wanted to volunteer. I was so excited to see and know that the number of students made time for the meeting. It shows the fact that there are a lot of young students who are interested in helping their communities and making time for it. Second, I know that a lot of my friends are working for volunteers already. Moreover, at the meetings of this kind, I have seen a lot of young people who attend volunteering, including from different universities, locations and backgrounds. If young people have not given enough time to supporting their communities actively these days how come I have seen these people? Also I know that they are not only supporting their communities but they are also willing to do it. They feel more responsible to the community through their activism. Doing these activities gives them a lot of satisfaction as a member of communities and society. For these reasons, I disagree strongly with the idea that young people today do not make enough time to help their communities.","Furthermore, as long as I know, they participate more in helping their communities.",-1.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Furthermore, as long as I know, they participate even more in helping their communities."

As you become older you have more to accomplish in order to respect what people expect from you. What I have just written could be contrasted with confirming that young people enjoy life because they do not know what life is. Young people cannot see the hidden difficulties that everyone experiences in his life. But we all know that sometimes it is good not to know everything. I could give also a personal example, when I was child life seemed easy to me, I thought that I could become everybody I wanted to be, but now I know that real life is different.","To reach your wants you want to reach you need to forget sometimes friends, sports, and all other things that could help enjoying life.",-1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"To reach your goals, you sometimes need to forget friends, sports, and all other things that could help you enjoy life."

1461195.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In my opinion, in the near future fewer cars will be used compared to what is used today. Several reasons can contribute to having this opinion. I think the technological advances that are going on in other transportation vehicles will decrease the number of cars being used. For example. Trains in Japan and Germany are becoming very fast and I think in the future they will compensate for the time it takes to reach the train stations. Governments will announce new laws prohibiting a single person from using a car. Already in certain cities, only cars with more than one passenger are allowed to use the fastest lane. This, encourages people to travel in groups. The reasonable development of such laws is that statement mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph. Home will be the center of all activities is another reason I would like to mention. Nowadays, many people work at home. All the needed entertainment can become available at home. Moreover, food ,from restaurants and grocery shops, is being delivered up to your door. Car models are becoming very similar in appearance and options. A very good example is the Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonata, it is hard to differentiate between them from outside.

666.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. But from my point of view, the opposite is the truth. I think it is hard for a young man to enjoy his life better than an older man. First of all, nowadays few young people are aware of the purpose of their lives. It is hard to say that a person can be happy without knowing the purpose of his life. Instead, many of them idle their precious time. They do not know what they should care most about in their life. Older people, on the contrary, know exactly what their purpose is. So they do not care much about other trifles as young people do.

This is what I envy older people most. One of my cousins spent two years in college and tried to find her favorite major. But even now she cannot make up her mind because she changes her interests so frequently. Furthermore, young people are not mature enough to control themselves. So they make more mistakes. Many young people do things just out of an impulse,. Sometimes it can be dangerous to do things this way. As for older people, most of them know clearly what is right and what is wrong. They have their own judgements and they can often do things according to their life experiences. No wonder our young people always need an adult to teach us right from wrong. Finally, young people are much easier to give in to temptations,especially in today's society. They are not steady enough to avoid the bad effects of many negative things in our society. But as for older people, they have seen much more than us, so they know when and how to say no to temptations.","So, I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person.",-1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"So, I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person."

I strongly agree with this statement because as a customer I deeply feel how different the products are in the advertisement and in reality. The purpose of an advertisement is to attract our eyes.
