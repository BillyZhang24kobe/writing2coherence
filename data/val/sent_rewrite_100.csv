58551.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"There are several views which are related to this topic. Some may think that there is no helping from young people for their communities. However, I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Nowadays, there are a lot of social problems in the world. These problems have to be solved by citizens. However, if it can't solve the first generation, the new generation, young people is needed. Therefore, we can easily observe from the cases that most university students participate in their society. They sometimes resist unfair politics or not good enough international plans. In this case, we can realize how they are really interested in their society and try to help their communities. Furthermore, all societies are educating young people.

901198.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although both young and older people can live a fascinating life, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people. This may be because young people have wonderful dreams about life, they are healthier, and finally, they have less responsibilities. Having dreams and aims is one of the most important things that make young people more enjoyable in life. Young people have many goals that they want to achieve, for example they want to achieve good education, a high position. Also, they dream of a wonderful wife/husband and a happy life, and they make their best efforts to achieve these dreams. Expecting and anticipation of a better future is a main source of happiness. Some, may argue that older people also have dreams and goals, but ,in my opinion, they face and experience real life which may be hard and disappointing. Another factor is, health is very important to enjoy life. When you are in good health, you can do any thing. You can make any effort you want, any kind of sport, any activity. Illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy. When you are ill, you should take care of your health; you should not do any hard activity, any excessive exertion, and can only do some kinds of sports.","You have to take care of times of different medicines, and see the doctor regularly, and so on.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, you have to take care of times of different medicines, and see the doctor regularly, and so on."
1147723.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The issue is whether it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one particular subject. I believe it is very difficult to answer this question, because there are many aspects which speak for booth of them. I think having a specialization in one specific subject is important for a special job, like chemistry. It will help you to be good at this work and to have the knowledge. A boss in a firm or company would search for this special knowledge and i think you will have a good chance to get this job. The special knowledge is very useful for you and you are an expert in a special subject. People would ask you for help and you are able to give a answer, because you are well educated in this subject. But on the other hand you should have broad knowledge, because you have the chance to get a better job and people will respect you. In my view you have a better chance with a broad knowledge of a lot of academic subjects to get a good job in this world today. You have a better spectrum of knowledge and I think it will help you a lot. I think knowledge is power and that is very important. People would you have more respect and you only have knowledge of one subject. You specialize in more subjects.","In my opinion, it is the question of what you need your knowledge for and what for a job you want to do.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"In my opinion, it depends on what you need your knowledge for and what kind of job you want to do."
1187884.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think that those people that try new things and take risks have more success than those that only do what they already know how to do well. One of the many reasons is that people try new things in their lives because they are looking at how to be altruist and how to be successful. For instance, if I want to be a competitive person sending cars, I need to have many ideas in order to create new models and new types, more strongs, more sures, cheaper and nicer. I have to try many risks during the elaboration of these cars, I have to risk a lot of money on employers that they be more prepared and I must give them all the necessary resources that the government's law requires.","If I want to be an altruist, I need to take risks even though I get scared.",0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Additionally, if I want to be an altruist, I need to take risks even though I get scared."

Students don't go to school anymore, because they use the internet to complete the group discussion, or find something about the assignment from a teacher who teaches them through the internet. In addition, it is more convenient to travel around by train or airplane. The train or airplane will be improved. For example, the price of the train and airplane will be very low, Does anyone want to drive by himself or herself or herself? taking the train or airplane is more efficient than driving your own car.

1828238.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. This, i believe is caused by the environment we live in. However, this is not a problem that is only limited to the young developing generation. I think that the adults that are living right now are also guilty of this problem. It is our whole population that is causing this problem.

1172673.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""Young people are strong and dynamic"" These words are proved by great scholars and philosophers of our country. I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands. Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs. they feel experimenting with them is an enjoyment. But those r not really enjoyable things in fact which apoil the carrier of the youngster. those kinds of enjoyment are restricted and enjoyment should be done so that he has a good time and good memories which he can share with his young generation. Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more ability to enjoy themselves. Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment. But older people cannot have as much enjoyment as youngsters as they have no energy and capability to enjoy themselves. Older people will have to think about their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories. Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying themselves. Those youngsters' ages don't permit them to control themselves from having fun. even in school or at educational places we have special time for refreshing and enjoyment for youngsters. This is only because youngsters should have enjoyment equally with studies. It is a saying by our great schoolteachers saying""All work no play makes a man lazy"" youngster needs some fun apart from their routine education life.","this is mainly to have peace of mind and relaxation Young people are more flexible when compared to old people they can do any adventure, whereas old people all depend on young people.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"This is mainly to have peace of mind and relaxation.

543465.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"yes i agree with the statement because they will have the dare to implement their innovative skills after one success. They always try to do something better and more useful than the others. They will never go with the things which have been done before but they will change or add some more features for those which have been done by them earlier. The successful people will also take the ideas of others which will be useful for them. They always go with the concept of "" TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU SUCCEED"". This is the major concept used by many successful people because they wo not leave the thing that they want to do.

If he/she adapted new skills and knowledge in each stage he/she can develop independence , self-esteem and maturity. For the same reason I strongly believe that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. When people learn how to communicate with their close family members for their needs they start to build up their independence. They are capable of being educated for new things such as how to talk, how to use the toilet or how to socialize with others. They have to face everyday challenges and pick up the new skills and information to grow up. These experiences give them independence to live their own in the future. As children grow up successfully in the early stage of life they develop self-esteem which needs to continue to respond to changes. When they have strong self-esteem they will deal with the difficult situations better and more efficiently than those who have a lack of self-esteem.","With all these successful experiences, growing children became adults with maturity.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"With all these successful experiences, growing children become adults with maturity."

1488357.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,It will be better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects because after you have all those academic subjects in your brain cells you won't have to worry about any problems with class work. My first point of view will be that if we have all that knowledge in the brain we can be much more cleverer and we won't have to ask our classmates about the problems that we have. We can solve it ourselves. It will be better to do it yourself than ask others because it will be quite embarrassing. You will have to look at others' faces just to wait for their answer and i'll prefer not to do that.

However, in the future that is portrayed as more speedy and comfortable than nowadays in some movies, we may discard our cars and the cars will be just a huge waste of time.

Some people have already visited out of earth, and lots of satellites are being thrown on the earth. Instead of using cars, they will move away by their personal flying like a plane or themselves.

266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world. As one man, if you have agood advertisement about your product, you will have agood idea around the world. Beacuse T. V can show your advertisements to be good. Also the TV can give your country agood background around the world.

But some advertisements seem the most time much better than they really are. In my opinion, i agree with this statement for these two reasons:the use of very good commercials and also the use of celebrities in the commercial. First of all , many advertisements have really good commercials which can convince people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of those commercials which want to sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as they get this product they might looklike this person.","For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is proof that these commercials work, but at the same time, the USA is still one of the most important countries with a weight problem."
715272.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"For some people, you will succeed in your life just by taking risks. And it is right, in a certain way. In fact, our society shows admiration for these kinds of people. But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank.

18690.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting. A specialist is the man who soeciallyizes in more than one subject. The famous English detectives in the novels are good at detective and music. Such examples can be seen in every day life. A man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so.",Though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing.,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"However, some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing."

1192415.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, for two reasons. Here are my reasons. First, if one person doesn't want to give enough time to help other people that means he is selfish. I joined an interview process and new hired people training at my company. In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help. Once I worked for a local campaign , but I always helped people and did some volunteer work for a patient group. Till I want to work at a Global company. Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities? Give the poor person help to educate, get work and receive benefits. We will not have much more public problems. Moreover we will feel happy and lovely. For these two reasons, I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities. Young people are like sponges.

Firstly, taking a sports man in to consideration he should adopt some new methods to improve his skills in his game rather than trying for some other games. so here the sports man is suggested to carry his carrier on the same field without going to other fields and taking risks. On the other hand ,let us see how success comes from new things. For example,white brothers invented aeroplanes as they were new to the world they were praised by the world. And later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplanes are not so much praised as the white brothers. This is because the basis and the idea is given by the white British and the others have just made some modifications. Those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extent that the white brothers got. the people who follow the procedure given by others may not get success as much as the people who give the basic idea.",we should note that going for new things gives success but it may or may not be changing the field of interest.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, we should note that going for new things gives success, but it may or may not involve changing the field of interest."

Some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide, they think that it is more quiet and peaceful. As for me, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. But I disagree with considering it as the best way to travel. First, most people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel. In some scenarios, it may be very dangerous for travelers. For example, if you travel alone in a forest where modern technology can not be used to communicate with the outside world.

To improve your skills, career, and knowledge, you have to challenge yourself. The most successful people are the people who do not fear failing. The person who fears failing can not challenge new things. I was that kind of person when i came to America. I did not try or challenge new things.

1941769.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I strongly agree that people who try new things and take risks will easily succeed in their business of life. The reasons are trying new things can find something different than other people easily, taking risks without worrying about what will happen next will usually help you make a brave decision that others are afraid to make, and people usually like staying with the person who has new things. First, trying new things is always an idea to find a different way. For example, the person who manages their business likes to have new, surprise, and unique ideas. At this point, the person is easily successful in his or her business. In addition, people always like to have different things on their day of life. Second, taking risks is a big deal for those people who just want to have adventures everyday. Sometimes, people can learn more experience through taking risks than people who don't take them. On the other hand, if people who don't take risks, how can they occur or improve the way they live. Third, people really like to stay with the risky person or lead by them. At this point, those people can feel the experience of taking risks or learn some skills that they never had. Also, people always do what they already know how to do, so that's why the risky person is attracted. In conclusion, this statement can also indicate what ingredients that a leader should have. A leader will always try new things, take risks for his or her teammates, and be attracted by his or her teammates.","When the leader who has these factors, is always easy to become a successful person.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"When a leader has these factors, it is always easy for them to become a successful person."

1455975.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is usually said that people should focus on only one specific subject to succeed. However, contrary to this opinion, I strongly believe that people who live in modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects. The reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who has a variety of knowledge. Moreover, if someone focuses only on one specific subject, he or she might be biased without balance. First of all, I strongly believe that people who are living in this period should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others. When it comes to biotechnology, people are eager to think that it has no relationship with philosophy at all. However, when I watched some SF movie, 'Island', I was deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives, so called global projects , which are reasonable and ethical. It is a problem of philosophy. This example shows that these two academic subjects are very similar to each other. Secondly, If someone commits only on only one specific subject, he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balance. This is because I believe that academic areas originated from one subject, which was not divided like now. As society began to be divided and specialized, academic subjects began to be separated too. However, nowadays, there are new tries to combine the separated academic areas for more academic progress. For example, to cure patients, doctors are working with sociologists because the reason that patients suffer from disease comes from not only health problems, but also social problems such as too much stress and environmental pollution.","In sum, without any hesitation, I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects than to specialize in one subject, All in all, academics in one.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"In sum, without any hesitation, I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject.

1632122.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"For me, as I am one of the young people nowadays, I believe that we should give enough time to helping our community. I would like to introduce our works for our community. In school we are asked to do voluntary work for an exact amount of time. According to my knowledge I believe every school has the same amount of time to do volunteerwork. Our school has to do more than 20 hours of volunteer work for 3 years of junior-high school. This may feel that we are foreced to do it, but even though we are forced to do volunteering, I say we eventually help out the community. Young people nowadays don't only spend time helping their community but also spend a lot of time helping their country. Korea is a small country with no fossil fules or what so ever. The only resource that can help Korea to keep on going to the top would be students' or young people's intelligence. A few days ago I found out that not even Japanese students study as hard as we do. What I also knew was that Korea's students had higher grades in math and science than other countries' students. Many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now. As  a result of this, many parents in Korea's young people are making their children work harder than any bodyelse. for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on. According to my opinion, I think young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities.","Although helping by volunteering which is forced to do from school, I believe young people do realize they are helping out their community.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Although volunteering is often forced by schools, I believe young people do realize they are helping out their community."

I think that both things in different ways can bring success to a person's life. Sometimes a person is good at doing something, and they really enjoy doing it, so she/he really puts effort and commits to doing the best they can, and they achieve success doing that. Furthermore, a person that doesn't feel good doing something or feels that they can be better at doing something else should take a risk of trying new things.

You can travel alone or with a group, with a guide or without a guide, all of these depend on the motivations of your trip. I think the best way to travel will depend on the motivations of your trip. Maybe if you want to spend so much time quietly relaxing or maybe meditating, you will prefer travelling alone without a guide. The motivations for that kind of trip are only to relax and have a good time. Some people need this time, in this rush society where all the things pass very fast. Some people need space to enjoy themselves and have time to themselves. For these reasons I believe if you decide to have your time the best way to travel is alone. But the other way is if you want to enjoy yourself and take a trip for educational reasons you will choose to go with a group and guide. The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go to.

Even the way they succeed is different the common thing is that they gave their entire life to buildingit. In my opinion successful people don't try new things but try to develop the things they can do well. BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old. At that time there were two famous companies called MACANTOSHI & APPLE(well later they united though). He tried to learn computers because it was very interesting. later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself. This kind of result was possible because he constantly developed his talent. In my opinion, successful finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important. EINSTINE is also a successful person is a physicist. His new theory about black energy, black holes, time, lights and movement destroyed newton and platon's theory and made a new page in the history of physics. It is hard to believe that this huge theory was made by a single man. In my opinion, the reason it was possible is because he always thought about physics.

Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life.

Turning to the statements that should be claimed, one informative example is doctors, having a complete knowledge of all the academic subjects such as anatomy and many more , will improve the jr. docters to perform the operation on the human bodies, because all the people going to the doctor will have complete credibility on them that the doctors cure their illness , there is no exaggeration that if the anesthesiologist performs an eye operation he will be perfectly perfect in all the organs functioning such as brain, nerves etc. so a doctor should be well practiced with his academic subjects.

In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan.",I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Therefore, I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem."

1110281.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, people however their age, are selfish because of the values conveyed by modern society and capitalistvalues. Indeed, everybody thinks about themselves so young people have grown up in this atmosphere of ''me and myself''. Life goes fast and we want to pursue and achieve our plans because today everything is planned per advance and there is no time for civic behaviour. In addition, globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identificationproblem: which communities are for which people? Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fights between them.","So, there is no unity in this world why would young people change this by helping who and with which means?

1829713.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Nowadays, young people usually spend most of their time socializing with their buddies, having parties, going surfing, going skiing and having fun. They enjoy their life so much. They think they have so much time to spend with each other. They don't need to worry about getting old. Yet, most sophiscate older people find their ways of life. They find their goal, their dream and they keep moving forward in their life. Because they had been young, they knew they had made some wrong decisions before. They are willing to make it up to them and make a better life. To me, I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Day in and day out, it is not hard to find young people committing suicide, they take drugs and go to rave parties. It seems they are so happy with their life. In fact, they are wasting their precious time. Numerous young people try to have different kinds of leisure in order to get rid of their stress like exams , complicated love relationships , family scold. In contrast, most older people have experience of knowing what mistakes they made in the past, they feel everyday is a good day, they enjoy their lives. They feel life is too short. Besides, they usually have more capitals to let them do more things like traveling. Most volunteers are from older people, they are more willing to give. They want to help people who are indeed. This is exactly what life should be. Life is about happiness, older people arrive at a destination where they can share their joy with other people.","Next, when you see older people, you will always find a happy face on them.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, when you see older people, you will always find a happy face on them."
216699.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago. The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need.","I was kind of addicted to television home shipping a few years ago, the seller in the homeshopping mentioned what kind of people need their product.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, I was kind of addicted to television home shopping a few years ago, where the seller mentioned what kind of people need their product."

Or, should we stick to what we know how to do best? Don't we have an intrinsic curiosity? So, what makes us frightened to try new things or should we be brave enough to choose not to do what we already know best? Could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing? As a successful commander Sir Winston Churchill has a saying: ""The first of all values of man is courage"". I agree that in order to be successful people should be brave and try new things.

1550812.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement. Young people are too lazy to help people nowadays, although we sing:""stand hand in hand"" everyday in school. Young people nowadays are getting more and more selfish. We can hardly see a young person helping an old granny to cross the road nowadays, because we prefer chatting with friends beside the roads. I do not really know South African young people's behaviour, but i know young people in China very well. Of course, not all of us are selfish and unconcerned, but the majority of young people are selfish. They are everywhere, in the school, on the street and even just in our families.

Currently, A lot of people do nt have a lot of time as much as a long time ago. Therefore, time has become very important in our student life. Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain.

They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight.

Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For the person who wants to know, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point. Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product. For instance, as you know, fast food is not good for your health. However, the companies which produce fast food, they usually hide the fact which can cause problems for the body like cancer. In particular, for children, they can be addicted to fast food because they just see the advertisement which looks delicious.

On the one hand, I could specialize in order to become one of the best at what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another subject, while on the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill. A lot of scientific development wouldn't have happened if scientists just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improved the way he viewed physics, he wouldn't have been able to develop his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics.

If he/she adapted new skills and knowledge in each stage he/she can develop independence , self-esteem and maturity. For the same reason I strongly believe that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. When people learn how to communicate with their close family members for their needs they start to build up their independence. They are capable of being educated for new things such as how to talk, how to use the toilet or how to socialize with others. They have to face everyday challenges and pick up the new skills and information to grow up. These experiences give them independence to live their own in the future. As children grow up successfully in the early stage of life they develop self-esteem which needs to continue to respond to changes. When they have strong self-esteem they will deal with the difficult situations better and more efficiently than those who have a lack of self-esteem.

That will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the places you like better. Another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spending according to your budget. In a group, the places you will visit are determined by the tour guide, and unfortunately, you cannot change it. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide costs a certain amount of money, which probably would cost you less if you planned it yourself. You should follow the tour guide and go to the restaurants the guide determines as opposed to getting your own food. For example, my husband and I planned an ""interrail"" trip in Europe a couple of years ago. It was all on our own. We planned in advance where, when, how, for how long we would go. It was more fun to explore the places on our own since we had the chance to interact with local people in their regular daily life. We made friends too. As a result, I strongly support the idea of travelling on your own.","You have more freedom, you interact with people and you make friends.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"As a result, I strongly support the idea of travelling on your own because you have more freedom, you interact with people, and you make friends."
328055.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are.","Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it.",0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Third, however, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it."
1408795.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The world changes very fast. People change with the world and they have to adapt to society in the best way. Young people nowadays have different tasks to do from the people who were young in the past. Today life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different to those 20 years ago. A young person has to go to college or university, maybe he has to work if he wants to pay for his studies or other activities. The free time is not a lot, so when a student is free, he usually goes out with his friends and to think about enjoying activities like going to a disco or listening to music. Someone might think that it is selfish but I am sure that a young person must have a leisuretime. However the time can be spent for the communities. It's quite true that a lot of young people don't like helping their communities. The young people nowadays are not all lazy. I can explain this point by a clear example. Last week I went to a rock party which was organized by one of my best friends. He worked a lot because this event was wonderful, but he did it with other guys. The party was a music competition. There were a lot of people and everyone was very happy because the players were fantastic and the organization was too. In conclusion I think that today young people are different from the young people in the past so a comparison is not so easy. The free time is less and the things to do are more.",The young people's mistake is to think that doing something for the communities is boring.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"However, the young people's mistake is to think that doing something for the communities is boring."

An easy example is the action of crossing the street, I look to the right and to the left to ensure that there is no car on the street, because I understand that it is dangerous to walk through a street with driving cars on it since they would drive over me.",If I had only learned it by heart I would have crossed a street by driving cars on it and so I wouldn't be here doing the Toefl.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"If I had only learned it by heart, I might have crossed a street with driving cars on it and wouldn't be here doing the TOEFL."
1624635.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I disagree with what the statement says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I have three different points of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually. First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan anything because the tour guide knows everything about what to do or where to go. It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group. When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended. I am sure a tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat, but you have no choice but to eat something else. Even for the food, I want to research what is the most popular food in that country and I will figure out whether I can eat this food or not. If not, of course I will look for another place to go.","Finally, traveling is all about experiencing new things from a new world at least I think.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Finally, I believe that traveling is all about experiencing new things from a new world."

1379069.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The issue at hand, is who does enjoy life, young people or old people? ?This subject is an interesting one, because it challenges all ages to enjoy life regardless of their age. From my point of view, I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones because they have all the abilities, health, and energy to enjoy life. The first reason I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones is because they have the motivation towards life, and life without motivation is like a car without oil. For example a young person will work hard towards improving his job description, or his capabilities, and from my point of view this is an enjoyableexperience. Whereas, an older age person does not have the motivation or energy to achieve any of his remaining goals. Another reason I believe that young people enjoy life more is that they have the facilities to face all surrounding problems and obstacles.","Obstacles that affect daily life, obstacles challenge the younger people, and thus make life more enjoyable rather than depressing them.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, obstacles that affect daily life challenge younger people and thus make life more enjoyable rather than depressing them."

First of all, everyone must enjoy life every age, other wise you can bore in life. But when you are young, you can enjoy life more than everybody else. Because you want to try everything in the world. You want to go everywhere with your friends. When you are young, you have lots of energy to do something, you want to live life, you want to see everything. Sometimes you can learn some lessons about life. It can be good or It can be bad for you. Also, when you make lots of things, I will look for extra things. You want to live in city life. You can go to bars, cinemas, restaurants. like lots of things. Also you want to earn lots of money to buy expensive toys, because this is life. But in ages you will be an old man or woman.

543170.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not.","Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Therefore, the price of products can distort the customers' attention away from the actual quality of the products."

834700.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Currently, there are more people who help others than before. At the beginning of the century my country suffered a civil war. People had big problems and they only tried to survive. They did not want to solve the problems of the others, they only wanted to eat and to care for their families. However, right now, not all people have big problems and they are more implicated in their communities. In my personal experience I could explain these arguments with several examples. When I was young, my teachers at highschool encouraged students to help other people in their subjects, even if those students were in an other school. I felt very well because I could help a lot of people who did not know how to speak or how to write. I remember two girls who were 8 years old and they didnt know how to read. I helped them twice a week for years and they finally learnt not only how to read, but also how to write. Furthermore, when I was at university, I created with my friends an organization that prepared conferences in order to obtain money for poor people. We could collect a lot of money by doing these conferences.
