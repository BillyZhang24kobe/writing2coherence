0,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements are a good way to sell products. In fact, they can make products look much better than they really are. Therefore, they can make them look different sizes and more beautiful. First, tricking customers' eyes is a really good way to get more money. First, you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it look the desired to people. For example, I remember a TV show that was unbelievable to win a sports car if anyone answered the question shown on the screen. However, the question was so easy that I was going to call them. I saw alot of people calling them; in fact, the TV show got alot of money from the people calling it. A person won the sports car, finally, and he was so happy. However, the funny thing is that the car was a really small car. Actually, it was a kid's car toy. Therefore, they showed the car, and everyone thought that it was a real car with a real engine, but that tricked everybody even me. I think that this is a smart way of marketing products. Second, advertisements make the products look more nice and beautiful. In fact, they use professional and careful workers who can handle the product without making any mistakes that let the people notice any disadvantages of it. For instance, i saw a knife advertisement. The knife seemed so sharp. that was just because of the careful workers. however, when i tried the knife in my home i broke it. In brief, advertisements make changes to the product size and make it more useful.","[""Advertisements are a good way to sell products.

1,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years from now, surely. Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem. Many countries are suffering from traffic jams. The government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jams. And one other problem as serious as the above is the environmental thing. Cars cause pollution in many ways, most seriously, the engine gas of cars makes the sky foggy and dirty. It causes contagious eye diseases, and respiratory problems. In addition, it promotes global warming which is making mankind very afraid. The carbon dioxide in the engine gas makes the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth. And then the water level rises and covers the available land of us.","['There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years from now, surely.

As a result of it Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, will be publishing new types of programs every month or every two months. Because he doesn't want to lose his reputation and there are so many companies that want to see their programs make a better profit than him, sell more copies than Microsoft, Bill Gates' company, does. So he wants his company to keep improving and to make new products for computer users. Also a basketball or a soccer player needs to improve himself and try to add new things to his playing style. Because if they don't try new moves and make regular moves that they are doing all the time, the opponent can control them easily, the defender can defend them easily. And if they keep playing in the same way they can't have an effect on the match so even if they can be cut from the team and broke. In soccer, Ronaldinho who is the best player for this Decade for a lot of people says that he is so successful because he improves himself everyday and keeps looking for new dribbling skills that when a defender sees them in a match defender will be surprised and he will get passed thedefender easily. In conclusion, i think that successful people should try new things rather than doing the same thing over and over again. So that they can't be just wannabes and people love them and love what they do.

For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends.

It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance. Second, two important motors of human beings' behaviour are motivation and emotion. These people are really motivated to get new experiences, learnings and knowledge. And even, this behaviour makes them pleasure by increasing some chemical substances in their brain. For example, taking new risks, such as changing the location of living, taking a new job and meeting new colleagues are really activities that pleasure them. They are moved by their motivation and emotion in order to achieve their goals and to become satisfied with them and their environment. Finally, I think that success in life, that is, reaching their goals, can be got by trying new things and taking new risks.

There will be a car which flies in the sky, or intermediate moving vehicles from one place to another in one second. This new technology makes people not use a car because it will require less energy to operate and it will be more convenient, and faster than today's car. Secondly, People use public transport rather than their own cars. every year, the number of people who use public transport such as buses, trains and subway is increasing. According to the statistics, the reason why they take public transport is it takes less money, less time and is convenient. If they have their own car, it costs a lot of money to fill petrol, parking fees, taxes, car insurance and fixing the car. As well as this, the cost of petrol is rapidly increasing. Also, there are terrible traffic jams every morning. This is a reason why people use public transport rather than their own car. This will make fewer cars than today in the future.

The behavior of teachers is to push students to develop their own understanding of different subjects more or less important. But the aim is to increase some capability to think by themselves and not discuss a subject only in telling the facts they or they learn before without any construction in their comment or their way of thinking. If a student studies scientific subjects for instance, he or she needs to have a certain knowledge that is to say, he or she needs to learn theories and the history of the subject.

16,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Definitely, people who are successful take their life in continuous challenges. Sometimes, someone asks why he/ or she can get everything that he/or she wants and I can't. In my opinion, the answer is very simple. It is necessary work and I work very hard to achieve my goals. People who are successful have three essential characteristics that frustrated people do not. The first is to take risks all the time, second they are confident in themselves and the last they are positive. First, people who are successful say yes to almost everything to do!. For example, I was working on a project in the pathology laboratory, but a colleague from my field invited me to work on a different project. I worked with him without thinking about the inconveniences of the result. when I accepted, I meant to study harder and for long hours to compensate for my deficiencies in something new. However, I did and we finished the project and published it. Secondly, usually these people are confident in themselves. They don't feel scared to begin something. In fact, they are always in continuing challenge and never think in fail. They know very well their limits and capabilities. In addition, these characteristics let them work in the best advantages of the rest of the people. For instance, I followed the tennis court to a famous basketball player. He knew his capability and effects better than anyone, so he worked specifically in his effects until he improved. As a result , he was the best basketball player of the year. This point is relevant for being successful, if I know my limitations. I need to work harder all the time with it.","[""Definitely, people who are successful take their life in continuous challenges.

17,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years. Considering the facts it may be a good thing, if there were fewer cars, this would help our environment get healthier again. Even so the need and lack of alternatives will not chance the amount of cars during the next twenty years.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

23,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is important that everybody enjoys their lives. But who enjoys it more, young people or older people? In my opinion, older people enjoy their lives more because they know what true enjoyment and freedom to do anything is. Firstly, adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what true enjoyment is. Youngsters call playing computer games, going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life. However it is too small to be an enjoyment inone's life. Older people enjoy their lives in a greater range. For example, the head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit, directing people and going to dinner with his family, which are far more enjoyable than playing computer games. Secondly, adults have the freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy. For youngsters to enjoy their lives, there are numerous things that are not permitted to do, such as drinking, traveling without parents. However, there is no such barrier for adults. For example, my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business. Then he told me that he would go to these beautiful places and would come back with a better future. I, after listening to him, immediately thought of all the stress that I was getting from school and planned a trip alone. However, I could not make the trip because of my parents' disagreement.

32,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge. There are three reasons why I think that. First of all , It will be very boring to study one subject for a long time. In fact , you might get totally exhausted and you might even lose interest in that subject. For example, students who are good at calculation study math for a long time and would also like to change the studying subject to a subject that can be read without using your hands or brain. Secondly, you can know what you are really interested in when you study a bit of various subjects. This is the reason why education doesn' t focus on a specific subject and it can also make up the choice of what we really like about a student after a long time of basic education till high school. For example, we decide what major we want to study after entering universities. We can decide by the interests we developed since we started elementary school. Furthermore, I believe with the advantage of learning everything a bit gives more opportunities to choose various jobs. we can use our broad knowledge instead of one specific idea to apply jobs we want in the future. For example , people who want to study hotel management when they apply to their universities.","[""The issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

33,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"At the beginning of the 19th century, the first advertisement appeared in public life. In fact,certain goods are meant to be described as much better than they really are. However, in my personal opinion, I believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the AD makers are over promoting their goods. First of all, human beings are animals that are full of desires. We want ourselves to be respected and popular among others, so we are usually willing to pay to help us achieve that goal. For example, most of us use shampoo to wash our hair everyday, and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner. Yet, is that true? Is there any scientific data ever proving that shampoo can clean up our hair? Look at the TV shows, magazines and the internet again, there are still a lot of six - year - old women who make themselves more charming by using certain brands of shampoos. As soon as we believe those advertisements, and are persuaded by them, we will go straight to spend money on buying their goods. And most of the time without even a reason. Also, if you pass by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge AD of a sports star wearing a pair of NIke sport shoes and looking so happy and cool, won't you start to have an idea of ""Wow, those shoes look so good""? Even so, is the truth that truning out as a pair of NIke shoes is the reason that we become cooler and happier? Easy enough, the answer is no. Actually, it is not the game of advertisements that makes most products seem better, but persuasion you by connecting different signals and messages into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them.","['At the beginning of the 19th century, the first advertisement appeared in public life.

49,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The thesis that there are fewer cars in use than today can be discussed controversially. Many points have to be considered in the global progress of economy, culture and maybe even events you cannot calculate with. In my opinion the number of cars in twenty years will most probably increase. There are different reasons why. The economy tries to sell more cars and did very well in the last decades. So I wouldn't expect them to work less effectively during the next twenty years. The trend goes to more consumption and the automobile sector is huge in a time when flexibility and local independence are wanted from companies. Also the basic for driving a car, petrol, is secured for the next hundred years. That makes it even more unlikely that a branch will increase its production. One actual topic is interesting when I consider it might be the way that fewer cars will be produced. Global warming is so impressively aware in recent years, e. g megatornados or wide spread floodings caused by melting poles, that people might be led to think about another way of being mobile. I can imagine that a new kind of car will come, hybrid cars, that will have another source of energy where exhaust will be pure water. That saves nature from acidic rain caused by carbondioxide. Under these circumstances the number of cars will increase. I am just not sure how long it will take to establish a new lobby for these kinds of cars, a lobby that has more power than the oil lobby today. At the moment car dealers have problems selling their cars, on the other hand there are more and more other car brands on the open market (globalisation). The result is that prices fall. With lower prices more people can afford to buy a car. And so the will, I guess. A problem with more and more cars is the infrastructure. Even in Germany the streets have more and more traffic. This can lead to more traffic jams than we havetoday, what makes it more expensive for firms or more stressful for usual drivers to drive a car. That could become a reason that the number of cars will increase slowly. In conclusion I can say that firms will find a way to sell more cars than now. One good effect of this can be that in spite of more cars the quality of cars referring to economic reasons will become better because of public pressure or because of a refusing nature.","[""The thesis that there are fewer cars in use than today can be discussed controversially.

50,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play. Young people are physically healthier and have more energy than older people. People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things. Experiencing convenient and fun things leads to people enjoying their life. For example, when people travel by car, young people may use a navigator in the car which helps them to travel far easily. They can find the location they want to see simply. However, old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators. Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people.","['I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play.

Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details. Therefore the ability to make a comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible. For instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film can only tell one or two sentences.

It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you. The main point is not to think only about ourselves. Everybody has to care about other people or even animals too.

Unfortunately, i think that i am one of them too. i remember when i was in the schools of China. We need to do the daily cleaning everyday by ourselves, because that is and still is a part of our school duties. The class teacher divided us into several groups, and told us the date that we would be on duty. We want a nice and clear environment to study in, although we do not want to do the cleaning by ourselves.","['I agree with this statement.

69,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The statement at issue is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Young people are considered the seeds of hopes in a country. Helping the communities not only accumulate young people's personal experiences but expand their visions of the various and nourishing lives. I argue that young people ought to pay more attention to the communities and be willing to spend time helping the communities. Therefore, I fully agree that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping their communities. Here are some reasons why. First of all, due to the flourishing media activities, the grand and big cities are undoubtedly fascinated by young people. They are eager to leave their home towns and build up their own dreams and realize those dreams in prosperous cities. For example, in some developed countries such as Taiwan and Japan , young people enthusiastically move to those grand cities to pursue their future. Only the elderly and the children stay in their communities. Furthermore, the government does not put in practice the education of how and why people should help their communities. Helping the communities looked dumb and unattractive to young people. They don't know how to help their communities can benefit the community, the whole society and themselves as well. Thus, the education authority should formulate a policy to demonstrate to the young generations the advantages of living in well developed communities and to educate them that it's not only an obligation but also a morale of being a member of a community. To summarize, the responsibilities of the fact that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities should be shared by individuals, the mass media and the government. My current observation has me conclude that.","[""The statement at issue is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

I tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic -like I said, I was a little boy then- , which i solved lots of times. However it did not matter how many times I had solved his problems. It just made him create more. Then I understood that it is not just the ""things in his mind"", but there is something more which is socially structured by human beings and our culture. As time goes by, we grow up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society, which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people. When we are talking about society, we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structured situations. In this example that I will give, one may see things more clearly. When I was at elementary school, I just had to pass my courses, then I attended high school, now I had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university. Now I am studying at Bogazici University which is really famous in Turkey. However my missions continue to increase and advance while I am succeeding and going on. This may seem like a story of one.

If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can\'t do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries. I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some people worry about how we charge for electricity. If researchers make more services or think more useful ideas, those will be used by more people. Then, how about the developing countries. The last reason is the problem of developing countries.', 'In some places in the developing country, there is no airport or a train.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

97,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In this topic, some students prefer learning facts, others believe understanding ideas and concepts is better. Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts. It is hard to catch the main ideas, students may only be interested in the stories, but didn't know the meaning. It can't happen when you focus on the ideas or the concepts. Because the concepts and ideas are the standard for whole stories. In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content of this course. Although the facts can let them know how to use it in society, it still limited. However we can't refuse it and it can lead to students getting some experience. It is still not general for the students. Finally, the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course.

There should be an energy when young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the environment they live in. It is sad that people can't see young people attending the activities of their communities. The reasons that cause this situation are competition, education and value. First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate in any activities. There is more stress on their shoulders, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and perform well in school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes. They have to sacrifice their playing time to achieve their goal. They try to get into a public university because the tuition is higher than before. There are many people who may not afford it. What a stress on them and it makes young people ca' t help their communities. Second, there is something wrong with education. Young people didn't get the right messages from education. As long as people live in a place and a society, they do have responsibility for participating in any activity and sharing their view.","[""I agree that most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

A person that has knowledge of different topics is a complete person compared to one that only focuses on one subject.

106,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing. Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives. In a way positively impacted us by being able to find a lot of things on the internet and make it easier for all ages to find things they would like.","[""It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age.

While others prefer to understand ideas and concepts. From my point of view, it is more advisable to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts. The main reason for my priority for this point is that concepts are from humans' activities and object facts. For example, why does an apple fall down? This is a fact that everybody knows.

First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease. On the contrary to teenagers, adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoying life. Children don't want to become adults because they are reluctant to have too many responsibilities. They are not aware of the violence and of the other problems that one could encounter, if they are to be protected by their parents. Parents think that their children are happier thanks to their protection but on the contrary, children will be more disappointed when they discover how harsh life can be.

109,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this. When people watch television, read newspapers or walk in the street, they see a lot of advertisements. Even though people don't concentrate on that, they already have influenced. The first problem is the company cheats the customers. When the company makes a commercial for selling a product, they usually try to show their products as the best and they tell them only good points. Because they made people believe that products didn't have any defects and customers but it. However, there are also many bad points. It is one of the cheating. The other one is overconsumption. The commercial stimulates people to want to get those products and actually they don't need them, but they buy them. Sometimes buying is caused by developing the economy, but typically it has to disappear. The third reason is cost. If they make an advertisement, they need money and when they make an advertisement that looks better, they have to pay more. It is going to be caused by the increase. The increase will cause poor people to suffer from money. The purpose of companies is to make money. Whereas they earn money, people's savings decrease.

110,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Personally i completely agree with this statement. Not only do I think this statement is true, but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act. I'm sure that one of the most important guidelines to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful, first of all you have to spend a lot of it! All successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evolving their companies and buying or creating new ones. I also think that one of the most important things for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power! It really doesn't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached. keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives. I can pick up a very well known example of a person who has been really successful: Silvio Berlusconi. The intention is not to discuss his political ideas, but to examine the goals a person has reached. A man who has always lived following this principle. At the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developing new companies. Some of these are always in the field of media, but some are not, like the italian football team AC Milan which he bought 20 years ago. Another example can be seen in the american Bill Gates. Can you imagine if he had stopped creating and inventing computer software after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway.","['Personally i completely agree with this statement.

In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products. So it will even cause the situation worse than now. From those kinds of accounts I expressed my opinion.","[""Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations.

In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind.

Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea. Secondly, you are able to improve the concept.

In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree. Anyway now I am a military officer and preparing to enter into post graduate school for public policy majors. I could say this route is paved way. If I had been diligent in learning many academic things when I was in high school, I could have found the right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself nowadays. Lastly, specializing early may make one be partial. As balanced nutrition is very important for toddlers, balanced learning for young people. If one goes into a specific thing too early, of course she knows very much about her subject but not about other things. It can make her concentrate more on the specific, neglect more on all the rest. It means imbalance. So she may have a limit even on her subject as a result of partiality. People say that reading is the food of mind. As you know reading is the main method we can getknowledge. So it is very important to get nutrition balanced.","[""In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject.

130,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. To sell a product, it has to have good promotion, advertisements sell the product because while showing the promotion of the product, the y are showing the best product ever, when sometimes it's just a big lie and sometimes it's the truth. The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market. There is a background behind a product, and belonging to a company. The product that is already on sale has an enormous study before getting to the store. Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time they pass through, by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about. The best way to sell could be by improving your product just by very tiny changes like making the product wantable, but not changing the product, just making people interested, curious and this will make people buy the product, this is a great way of doing a sell.

I am not encouraging companies to exceed reality but to use imagination instead of exaguration. since nowadays advertisements take more time than our daily watched programmes, i think the best way to attract consumers is by entertaining advertisements rather than fake ones.

134,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices. I have even come across a few parents who give their children the liberty to choose their career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects.

147,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts. In our society, most students attend schools and learn many things such as Maths, Science, and English. Based on what students learn from the schools is a fact, but they must understand the concepts and ideas of the lessons first. Understanding ideas and concepts requires more importance than the facts. Once they complete to comprehend the ideas and concepts, the way they study is easier and faster. For example, in a biology class, there are students who are used to analyzing ideas and concepts first than the facts and the students who value the facts more than the ideas and concepts. The student(fact) will be struggling with memorizing all the functions of the human body and will spend plenty of time finishingit. However, as mentioned above, once the student understands how each function of the human body works, it is easy to memorize. Moreover, the study may be fun and enjoyable. Learning the facts will take less time than understanding the ideas and concepts because people just memorize the facts without understanding ideas and concepts. It is easy to forget. Once people get the concepts of the lessons, it is in your brain,and logically it will stay longer than just learning a fact. Hence, it is more crucial for students to understand ideas and concepts than the facts. Once they get the concept, it is easy to study and stay longer in your head than understanding the facts.","['It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts.

158,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"We are living in a particular period; we are being hitten by advertisements: when we walk along the street we can count a big face with the same product on his/her hands, or when we are listening to the radio we can listen to a particular voice that tries to convince us to buy something, when we switch on the tv there is always some spot with funny music. In each place, in each situation we are covered by advertisements. It is easy to ask ourselves if the products that are presented are so brilliant. I think that a lot of the time it is so: most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I can say this for different reasons, first of all because the objective of the company is to sell their products, and so they use all the methods that are necessary to convince people to buy them. Second because a lot of time people buy a particular product not for its quality but only for its mark. For example we can think about food: what are the differences between one biscuit to another? A lot of the time the difference is the price: the product that is well-known is more expensive than the other, but if we taste the quality we can' t understand the difference because they are equal. Another example that I could consider is about clothes. There are a lot of people that want to wear only one type of, for example, trousers because there is a little spot on them. Probably it is only to be fashionable, but this traffic, which costs a lot, isn' t different from another.","[""We are living in a particular period; we are being hitten by advertisements: when we walk along the street we can count a big face with the same product on his/her hands, or when we are listening to the radio we can listen to a particular voice that tries to convince us to buy something, when we switch on the tv there is always some spot with funny music. In each place, in each situation we are covered by advertisements. It is easy to ask ourselves if the products that are presented are so brilliant. I think that a lot of the time it is so: most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I can say this for different reasons, first of all because the objective of the company is to sell their products, and so they use all the methods that are necessary to convince people to buy them. Second because a lot of time people buy a particular product not for its quality but only for its mark. For example we can think about food: what are the differences between one biscuit to another? A lot of the time the difference is the price: the product that is well-known is more expensive than the other, but if we taste the quality we can' t understand the difference because they are equal.

160,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion this statement is true. I think this is because young people are at the beginning of their lives and not in the middle or at the end of it. You can recognise it if you start a new job. Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or months you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting. Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You should not be concerned about whether you have enough money either if you have a job or not. It does not matter to you. On the other hand it really depends on how people have planned theirlives. The most grown up people I know, have a house or an apartment somewhere, children and a job. Those people really do not have a lot of changes in their lives. The time schedule is nearly every week the same. However I know some other people who have a completely different way of life. For example one guy I know, he is 50 years old now, and has stopped working at forty.","['In my opinion this statement is true.

Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way.

Another example in which facts have to be strictly related to ideas is for example if you want to describe a marketing concept to a student.

175,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First, I think they can succeed because they have already taken their risk, it is all risk out side the world, each thing has a risk but seems to big or small. For example, if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be an accident on you. Taking risks is a must. The mean of success is they know how to do things well, A human being has a tendency to learn more to find out new things. Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve. Successful people know that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up with them. They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what the world needs so they can do it. Although many people think successful people are selfish, just doing things they like or they want, they won't share with others, but I think it is only other people who don't understand what they are thinking. THey have a different thought than others so they succeed , they won't just stop where they succeed. They want more success, everyone wants more success but not everyone can do it, so they know they can do it they won't care about the risk, even if the risk is big but if they can pass it they succeed. They fail, they keep on going to find another thing.","[""In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

Some of them believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I am hesitant to agree with the statement, and the reasons are listed below. Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them. Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather. And I am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being, cars will become more popular. Admittedly, Many people think that the number of cars will be decreasing, because they cause a great deal of pollution, and people nowadays pay special attention to the environment. Nevertheless, I deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finally varnished, with the development of techniques. And we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by the UN, that a car made with the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before.

However, I strongly prefer studying the academic subject of one specific academic subject because it strengthens people's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledge in one specific subject. First of all, I prefer specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learning environments. Learning many academic subjects needs a lot of time. Moreover, if some academic subjects are not interesting to people, then the environment discourages people's studying ability For example, according to a study by one of the most famous professors Dr. Kim, Republic of Korea, 68. 9% of people like learning one exciting academic subject because it makes people's good studying circumstances. In this sense, I would rather specialize in one specific subject because it strengthens people's exciting studying circumstances. In addition, I would rather study the academic subject of one specific subject because my future occupation needs professional knowledge. Our special occupation in the future is generally only one such as teacher, nurse and doctor. These occupations have a special technique to do their work.

In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money.

As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation.

This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation.

191,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money.

The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here.

However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others.

209,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes, I agree with this statement. Many companies make advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are. The companies do anything in order to sell their product eventhough they know that they are selling something that is not true. Many customers believe everything they see and buy the product if they see that the information that the company is giving them about the products makes it seem good. Because of the people that buy things when they see them in the advertisements companies think that it is a smart way to sell and will continue using it until someone puts a stop to it. An example from everyday life is when you want your parents to give you permission to do something you know is not right, in this case you tell your mom all thegood things about it and leave out all the bad things that it has and could have. Everyday, people say the things that favor them in order to obtain what they want or in order to sell their product. The big companies that have taken out the smaller companies of the cities convince people really easily of their product just by placing their products as if it where better that the others and the people would go directly to the larger companies that lie about the quality of their product. When a company tells you that it is guaranteed for life they have thought really well what the possibilities are that it has for a person to claim that guarantee. When a company guarantees a product for life, it is a way to persuade people into buying it because it makes it look like it is the best product of all and they are so sure of it that they gurantee it for life so you will buy it.

Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try. Once you begin with one subject ,you will be surprised at what it looks like and try to find out more about it. For example, you are having a toefl test.

Secondly, knowledge can be an aid to anyone who can help you to be successful. But first of all, how can we get knowledge? The answer is simple, taking risks. In any kindergarten of risks, you must learn some skills to survive. In this process, your knowledge is gained and you are more approachable to success.

Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily.

What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years.

Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it.

If I had been diligent in learning many academic things when I was in high school, I could have found the right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself nowadays. Lastly, specializing early may make one be partial. As balanced nutrition is very important for toddlers, balanced learning for young people. If one goes into a specific thing too early, of course she knows very much about her subject but not about other things. It can make her concentrate more on the specific, neglect more on all the rest. It means imbalance. So she may have a limit even on her subject as a result of partiality.

221,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can.","[""I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

222,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main character, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with. therefore, he becomes furious at not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide. This is a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when you are young. I think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest, whether young or old, by doing the things he enjoys doing the most. That is when he can reach a mental satisfaction, by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life which is to enjoy life.","['Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death.

There are many reasons which support the first idea. Firstly, motivation is a very important factor in the academic knowledge process. When a person is interested in one subject he can protect his or her motivation for academic study. Secondly, keeping an order, combining the information about the subject makes a person expert and helps him or her to use and outsource. Thirdly, coordinated and specialized information is always helpful for a person. It also brings happiness and welfare to an individual's life. Another important reason is creating new theories or inventing new things. orders and specialized knowledge can easily produce new ways, theories, inventions etc by the help of its scientific history and experience. On the other hand, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has many disadvantages for an individual like disordered knowledge, unhappiness, endless force for the aim etc. Picking up some things from every subject may make a person feel learned or satisfied but not intellectual. Every cookie and disorderd thing in mind causes stress because a mind never achieves to coordinate them. Intellectual satifying is a influential poison for people who choose the short way to information.","[""Specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

225,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is collected around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority will have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak. Also if knowledge was limited to only one subject, scientistsn't wouldn't have success the success which they have today. For example, if Nuoten hadn't bothered to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, i don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all. he could have spent his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason for gravity.","[""Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion.

It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the battle started, what the conditions were after the battle finished, and so on. It could be in your brain longer than learning facts. Understanding concepts could be valuable when you are studying a different topic. For example, the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict. On the other hand, if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even, maybe you have to study again for your business or your geography class. Students could develop better skills if they learn concepts and ideas. They could argue for example, why the battle happened, or even learn that war conflict is not the best way to thrive.

235,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Since I've been a student for a long time, I can say that at the age when we are young students (for example High school age), we normally tend to care more about understanding ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts. Anyhow, I have to say that, at least as far as my experience is concerned, along the student's age we change our learing process, passing from giving more importance to theory to linking theory to facts. For example when we talk about students until high school, I believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools, family and social environment. At this age we don't care, for example, about political events or international affairs. This is due to the fact that certainly we are too young, we are more focused on other things such as having fun, going out, doing some sports. What is more, we're completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts. On the other hand, when we go to university, and this is another step towards being students, I think things change. It happens because we're getting into another environment in which we ought to be well considered, we're meeting other people with whom we're going to share more adult experience and last but not least we're getting more mature. As a result we can link in a more efficient way what we studied ( also during high school) to the real facts. For example it happens to me when I study the concept of inflation. When I was watching the TV news, I was really surprised to finally understand what inflation is and what its effects are. And this is not all.","[""Since I've been a student for a long time, I can say that at the age when we are young students (for example High school age), we normally tend to care more about understanding ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts.

There are also some girls I know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they seek or need help. These girls have a big sense of responsibility for helping others, I think.

Also they use fewer cars for small rides. I think this trend will keep going and that year after year, people will use their cars fewer and fewer, only because gas is becoming too expensive. Some cities try to encourage their citizens to drop the car. For example in Paris, the mayor's policy is to develop the use of public transport and to reduce the use of cars. So for several years, buses have their own lines in the streets to be quicker and not stopped by the traffic, the days of big pollution there are restrictions on the vehicles admitted on the streets, and parking' prices are cheaper for the residents so their cars don't move. This policy makes it so difficult to drive in the streets of Paris that I think many people will drop their car either for a bike or a scooter than for public transport. Of course people living in the countryside are not concerned by this policy. But other projects, on the national level, try to incite them to buy clean cars, or to have more responsible use.

You can travel alone or with a group, with a guide or without a guide, all of these depend on the motivations of your trip. I think the best way to travel will depend on the motivations of your trip. Maybe if you want to spend so much time quietly relaxing or maybe meditating, you will prefer travelling alone without a guide. The motivations for that kind of trip are only to relax and have a good time. Some people need this time, in this rush society where all the things pass very fast. Some people need space to enjoy themselves and have time to themselves. For these reasons I believe if you decide to have your time the best way to travel is alone. But the other way is if you want to enjoy yourself and take a trip for educational reasons you will choose to go with a group and guide. The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go to. In this occasion I think the best way to travel is in groups because in groups you can share ideas, information and you can learn in a social environment. Another example that illustrates my point is this: suppose two men decide to make a trip to El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico). The motivations of the first person are to have a good time with friends and explore all the forest, but the motivation of the second person is to have a good time reading in the high of the mountain.

However, I support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years for the following reasons. First, the price of energy will become higher than today. For example, many people prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy. Many car makers are making their efforts to produce cars which need not so much energy, though, such cars are high cost. In addition, there is difficulty in developing new laws that cost energy. As the above explanation demonstrates, in the future, people will use fewer cars than there are today. Second, environmental problems change people's way of thinking about traffic methods. For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city environmental problems are so serious.

To begin with, the growing number of cars is becoming a problem nowadays. In some cities, like London, they tried to find a solution to reduce the number of users by asking for a fee to drive into the city. Having so many cars in a confined area brings a lot of problems like pollution, parking problems, accidents without even thinking about the fact that so many cars consume a lot of fuel. Speaking of, it's abundance is dropping dangerously, and of course the price is equally expanding. It's becoming a luxury to drive now. Maybe there will be a restriction at some point, that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week. This could encourage people to drive with friends or colleagues to a work place for example. Thanks to this, fewer cars will be in use every day! I'm actually wondering if certain firms could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work. This could even bring people closer together.

However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better. Not only is information going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future. In order to get into a good company or create a good company. People do not need all the subjects to do this. The only thing is the strength you have over the others. For example, a good program writer's nesscery skill is to write programs. He/she does not need to know Zoology well to do so, so why should he/she bother studying it if society only needs one strong strength per person. Strong strength is what a good company is searching for. Furthermore, specializing in a subject for a student can also benefit society and the world. Inventions make the lives better for people, such as the internet search engine and medicine prolong lives.

They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers. They may have little knowledge or even be non-educated, but they have desires to explore the new world. Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there. All these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads young people to be higher, stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people. Another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth. Because of the limitations of age, the old lose lots of enjoyable things. They may be rich and healthy, but they do not have interests in nice food; they can buy a great variety of clothes, but they do not have good looks. Apart from their elders, the young take advantage of a nice age. No matter what clothes they put on, they seem to be active and handsome. They do not need to worry about blood pressure while having delicious pizzar or other fast food. Life begins with good food. In conclusion, I admit that there are negative points to young people. The fear of unemployment, hard work, scarce resources, consumption.","['I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people.

They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers. They may have little knowledge or even be non-educated, but they have desires to explore the new world. Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there. All these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads young people to be higher, stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people. Another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth. Because of the limitations of age, the old lose lots of enjoyable things. They may be rich and healthy, but they do not have interests in nice food; they can buy a great variety of clothes, but they do not have good looks. Apart from their elders, the young take advantage of a nice age. No matter what clothes they put on, they seem to be active and handsome. They do not need to worry about blood pressure while having delicious pizzar or other fast food. Life begins with good food. In conclusion, I admit that there are negative points to young people.', 'The fear of unemployment, hard work, scarce resources, consumption.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
304,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays due to the fact of a changing economic situation which asks for highly skilled and qualified people and makes it even more difficult to get a suitable job, it is more important for students to gain the ability to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is to learn facts in order to be special on the job market. At universities it is important that students do learn the theory of the subject in order to gain a basic knowledge in this sector. Unfortunately they do not experience a lot of the practical site. Apprenticeships are on a volunteer basis at most universities and most students use their free time off in the semester holidays to have fun instead of working for companies and doing traineeships. However, in the time after having finished university it is of great importance that students can show their future employees that they do know more than the pure theory. In daily working life it is necessary that one is able to work independently and furthermore is able to combine facts,own ideas and concepts. Most people leaving school think it is easy to study at university as they only have to learn facts which are provided by the professor.","['Nowadays due to the fact of a changing economic situation which asks for highly skilled and qualified people and makes it even more difficult to get a suitable job, it is more important for students to gain the ability to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is to learn facts in order to be special on the job market.

People who are successful have three essential characteristics that frustrated people do not.

I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more. Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future. They become more selfish. To sum up, given the reasons above discussion, I agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Burger King advertisements are the most popular examples for the curious consumers to find out about their consumer rights. Last but not least, being the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the price of your product. For instance Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market. So they are able to change the price of their products, Ipod, freely. How did they become the main producer? With advertisements actually.

It is important, that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding, but mainly these dates and names can be researched in a book, or on the internet at almost any time. Although, some very important key facts must be memorized. When I was in a conversation with an American visitor in Genova, standing in front of the Columbus museum, I could not remember, when America was discovered. A such an important date is known by any second grade child However, I could not remember the year. He reminded me, that America was discovered in 1492. I felt very bad at that time that I would never forget this important fact in my life. However, I am convinced, that ideas and concepts are much more important than learning facts. Concepts are more likely to be necessary in daily life, than are facts. What I mean is, if there were two or more countries combating each other, it would be war. From school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times, that in all wars many people were killed, and in most of those lands and people changed nationality once the war was over.","['In this essay I will shed light on the statement, that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

Young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their youth and things that are available to young people. First, in my opinion, young means full of energy, especially in physical conditions. Most young people have the best or better body conditions than older people. These conditions make people able to do many things like studying, playing sports, drinking alcohol etc. For example, when sportsmen get old nearly 40, they usually retire because their physical conditions are not strong enough to continue that job. Moreover, when people get older, they keep on destroying their brain cells whether they want to or not. Thus, young people can enjoy their life more than older people do because they are mostly healthier than old people. Second, when people are young, there are so many opportunities for them. Limitation to older people on the rollercoaster can be a good example of that. Because of young people, young people can try many things even though they fail a lot. One more example can be the availability of job openings. Companies want young people to work.","['Recently, most young people are concerned about how to enjoy their youth before they get old and when they get old, they want to have a calm, rest and relaxation.

321,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although older people can enjoy life, I definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people can enjoy eating, travelling, and being healthy. First, young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young. For example, when young people want to eat some great dishes, they can eat all of them. They can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot. However, usually, older people cannot eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot. Not only can young people enjoy eating, but they can also enjoy travelling. If the person who is young wanted to go somewhere, the person could go there soon. The person does not need a lot of preparation for the trip. However, if the person who is old wanted to go on a trip, the person would need a lot of time to prepare for the trip. So, young people are very flexible and aggressive. These aspects are very important for young people, however, health is the most important part of young people. Older people suffer from a lot of illnesses. They catch a cold easily, become tired soon, and need a lot of time for their rest. Also, they cannot play hard sports. However, young people are healthy and very aggressive. They can play hard sports like baseball, soccer, swimming and so on. Young people recover from illnesses soon. In conclusion, Young people enjoy life more than older people do.

322,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"An old saying ""A jack of all trades and a master of nothing"" suggests that a person should not try to have more of the broad knowledge of each and every subject but should be focussed on a single subject. So many other sayings were developed in the past related to this thing only like ""Little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" but they were the ones which were stated a long time back and are not valid today. Talking about the present scenario where success has become every man's need,a person who is just having knowledge on one subject can climb the stairs of a ladder that could lead him to a successful path. Its not bad to be focussed on but not salubrious in the current era. Focussing on one subject can have many diverse effects. Having knowledge of one subject the job areas to which the person can apply will be restricted. He will be able to apply for some of the jobs only, which could lead to more frustration and more tension as he will not be able to apply for jobs that may lead to fulfilling his major dream.

323,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that both of these options are very important for a student. Of course, it depends on what is your field of study. For this reason I would say that I disagree with this statement. For example if you are studyinghistory, it is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of course this is also a very important knowledge that is required ofyou, as a historian , to have. It is really very important, infact a student is studying for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what you are studying but I can't say that this is more important than learning facts, because without knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something. I'm thinking about when I was studying mathematics : for me and also because the teacher was very important that we, as students, understood the ideas and concepts behind an algebraic formulation, but of course you need to know very well also the formulation itself. An other reason why I disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text books, you can't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you don't remember the facts: I'm thinking at some friends of me that they study something and after a few hours you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink, except'm the main ideas. On the other hand, I think that is important in the future, I mean after 10 or more years after your studies, to remember the main ideas and concepts; and it is quite impossible to remember all the learned facts.

First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands.

For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads.

331,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are. Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it. The thing for people to decide whether to buy or not is usually outside looking.","[""Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products.

332,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank.","['The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts.

333,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I would have to agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. As more and more cars are rapidly produced today, the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportation throughout a nation. The space allocated for the vehicles will soon not be enough. Population growth directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road. Highways of hundreds of metres tall will anyway be fully congested with drivers. With limited spaces or lands throughout a country, any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of cars on the road, which also could cause pollution. As do the government here in Malaysia, they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road. One move that was made to the Malaysian government to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes. By imposing a heavy percentage of taxes on imported as well as local cars, it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find an alternative mode of transport. But this has obviously been proved less effective. This automatically brought them about to reduce the number of drivers instead. For example, an action that has been taken by the government is by setting an older age line for wannabe drivers to be competant on the road. This delay of upcoming drivers is also supported by another wise move, which is to improve the country's public transportation. Public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestion on the road. Take for example, the train. Easy accessibility, low and flat priced tickets and large-sized public transportation are the perfect characteristics of a highly effective mode of vehicle which many governments are vying to achieve. The most obvious example of a highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in Japan. Another example is the country, Australia that I have visited.","[""I would have to agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

338,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Knowledge is power.

Knowledge opens a lot of doors, but will not keep you in a small circle. I don't want to be misunderstood. Specializing in a topic or subject is not bad but this can't be the only thing you know.

That's wrong because if you want to go to another country for vacations and they don't speak your language, It will be very hard for you to communicate with people. And one of the funniest things about going on vacation is to interact with the people of that country you are visiting. I think people should be excellent at one thing and very good at others. It should not be empty spaces in your brain. Society should focus more on promoting knowledge because almost everybody knows that humans don't use their brains to their full capacity. And having a society with people that are good in a lot of areas, is a society that you know will have success.

First of all , many advertisements have really good commercials which can convince people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of those commercials which want to sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as they get this product they might looklike this person. For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight. Secondly, there is a huge use of celebrities in the advertisements that gives a false image of what a product really is. For instance , the last campaign of Proactiv Solution which is supposed to help to relieve acne. Personally, i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress. So when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol whouses this ' it might work for me too. So ' i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change as i thought. Thus , i think that a good commercial and a use of a known person make more products look better than they really are.

349,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the idea that it is more significant for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. First of all, many of the students would prefer the easier and quicker way of understanding. Understanding ideas and concepts is easier for a student to manage the information. If a student learns a new thing, she or he would first ask the ideas and concepts of the thing to realize the conditions of the new information. This way always seems more practical to the students. I also would prefer this way, since understanding the main idea by explaining both ideas and concepts would make me understand more easily. Facts are a longer and harder way for most students.","['I agree with the idea that it is more significant for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

350,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There are different opinions among people concerning whether having broad knowledge of many subjects is more desirable than specializing in one specific subject. Although it is true that having broad knowledge can help people with various problems, as far as I am concerned, I conceive that specializing in one specific subject is more preferable to having broad knowledge in our life. I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea. The first reason is that because society will change more complicated, the demand for specialized knowledge or skills will increase. In fact, in ancient times, people had to do everything well to survive, but now people don't need to be capable of everything. For example, a famous baseball star can earn enormous amounts of money only because of his abilities at throwing balls fast. The second reason is that in modern society people cannot obtain broad knowledge of many specific subjects. Nowadays, new knowledge and skills are produced so fast and much that we can't keep up with the pace ofdevelopment. If there is a person that is able, the person's faith is only his or her subjective faith.","[""There are different opinions among people concerning whether having broad knowledge of many subjects is more desirable than specializing in one specific subject.

369,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Although some people may think that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are, I totally agree that it helps the product to be sold out in the market with the result of the consumers' curiosity, if it is an advertisement made of/for women and if the advertisement is colourful enough. First of all, advertisements increase the curiosity of people especially if it is for women. Assume that a woman is watching the TV, who loves chocolate and sees the commercial on the television which has the mother seeing her son and her husband as a bar of chocolate and wanting to get a bite of them, the woman watching the commercial will be curious about the product and will give it a try. It is obvious that she won't be the only one so this will give a chance for that product to take place on the market shelf. It will be the consumers' decision to keep it there or ignore it on the next visit. The second thing is that women are the best customers in the world. It may not be the man who would like to give it a try if he sees the product right after he sees the advertisement but a woman can keep it in mind in the shopping list and that list appears when it comes to shopping and she picks up the product and gives it a try. For example, if it is a man who is in the market to get a pack of coffee he most likely picks up the package of coffee he is used to but if it is a woman she gets her regular coffee with the one she saw on the board on her way to the mall. The third one is colourful and well prepared advertisements.","[""Although some people may think that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are, I totally agree that it helps the product to be sold out in the market with the result of the consumers' curiosity, if it is an advertisement made of/for women and if the advertisement is colourful enough.

For example, cars, if people are eager to buy new models of cars, and they do not try to do something new, how boring, we do not have a lot of options, but because they take risks we have numerous options when we are looking for a car, you, me, everybody can buy all kinds such as: a BMW, a Jaguard, a Camry, a Jeep, etc. Also, people who want to start a new restaurant, the want to open something new. If in the area where they are going to build this new restaurant there are some Chinese, Greek, or Thai food, but they do not have real Mexican food, I think that the best thing they can do is start a restaurant that is not in this area.

371,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products much better than they really are except tobacco and medicine advertisements. In tobacco advertisements, they always express bad images of tobacco. Outside the package of tobacco, they write about concern about cancer with tobacco. In the advertisements for tobacco, we can see bad images of tobacco, but many smokers don't stop smoking in spite of these advertisements. My friends watch these advertisements for tobacco everyday, but keep smoking. The advertisements for medicine have a restriction, so a medicine company can't use an expression which tells more effects than it really are. But about other products besides tobacco and medicine, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the TV commercials, beautiful women and handsome men use these products in sophisticated places happily. And also we can listen to fun commercial music which makes the images of these products better. Sometimes famous movie stars appear in the commercials and tell us how these products are great and useful. There TV commercials are broadcast on TV several times a day, and finally we remember the names of these products unconsciously.

380,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I would say that I do not agree either disagree with both of the statements. Personally I think that the truth is in the middle, as also the romans used to say. Ideas and concepts in order to be well explained need some facts to be related to. An idea could be difficult to explain, but with a fact, an example, the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to memorize. As an example, I can speak about the french revolution. What was the idea at the basis of the french revolution? According to these subjects, In a class many ideas can be explained by the teacher (I would add in a boring way). Supporting ideas with facts (for example explaining the idea that led to the killing of the king) would be more interesting for students and also more beneficial for their learning. Many ideas can be well explained, but to really understand them, we need to surround ideas with facts, interesting facts, I would add. Another example in which facts have to be strictly related to ideas is for example if you want to describe a marketing concept to a student. Of course the idea is really important because everything starts from an idea, but also in this case in order to support the idea we need to draw some conclusions speaking about facts. Of course I am speaking about old ideas, because what I stated before clearly does not match with new ideas. How is it possible to speak about a subjective theme like marketing and separate the idea at the basis of a marketing campaign from the results (the facts). in conclusion I would say that what I described is my opinion of the best way of teaching.

385,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Humans and study are connected very closely. People start to learn from when they are born. We have to learn language, ways of living, and many subjects in the school. I think the bigger knowledge is the better. It is good for people's minds, solving many problems simultaneously. First of all, knowing many things is helpful to someone's life. From learning many academic subjects, we can broaden our knowledge and common sense. Also, we can meet many people who study other fields, and speak to each other. Not only can we develop our social skills, but our thoughts are getting bigger. We can see other sides of society too. For example, there are many students who have a double major in my school. They can meet many students who have another major, and they know many professors. I think it is very helpful for students' futures. Furthermore, knowing many subjects, we can apply one thing to another. I think most subjects are related, and they have an influence on each other. If we know one subject accurately, it will help to understand other subjects. Hence, broad knowledge of many subjects is good for understanding many things. From my personal experience, when I was in high school, I solved many mathematics questions. From this process, I could also develop problem solving skills in society. I can use mathematical knowledge to solve real problems. To sum up, knowing many things has several advantages. It is good for a person's mind, also living in modern society.

386,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits. I have more positive experiences of travelling with a group than travelling alone. So i like to travel with groups led by a tour guide. Travel with a group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensive. Usually for group travel , one will take care of the ticketbooking, hotel reservation etc. The group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay. So i don't need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress. Last year,I visited India with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free. My group leader organized travel and reservations and my tour guide took me to all the important places. The guide will take the group and show everything that the group needs to see in that area. In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for the next day's events. This is so time saving. This way, i can concentrate on other things like enjoying my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meeting new friends at the party etc. Group travel is safer. All ways you have some one along with you and take care of them if needed.","[""Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits.

387,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People usually say that young people are the future of our society. It is because they have much more time to think about their rest of their lives and their futures. In addition they have a lot of opportunities to learn and try what they want. Moreover, young people are usually very healthy to do something hard that they face on. Therefore, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius. To sum up, the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things. But its maybe the most important thing to realise that all human beings are different. As we all have different abilities and unabilities. The real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being taught.

400,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice.

This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"". In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation. Due to gravity whatever things are thrown in the air from theearth's surface will fall on the earth again because of the gravitational pull of the earth. If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from the earth will fall back to the earth's surface,then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason why.

406,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be young is beautiful. If you were a child, you could do what you like without problems.","['In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion.

407,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life. It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts. Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying. while a person can teach something if he does nt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough.","['From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life.

And in my view, I most like to agree with the statement. I know it is irrational to make a point without understanding, so I'll get help from my own experience. Last summer holiday, some friends with me went travelling to the beautiful coastal city of Dalian, which locates in the north of China. The reputation of Dalian is very good in China, and surely we are all delighted about the chance of travelling to the beautiful city. But things do not always go on as we wished. As strangers, we are excited about its fantastic landscape while arriving in Dalian. For the sake of saving money, we didn't hire a guide, and we thought a map could handle it. The coming things prove that we are absolutely wrong. Soon after the excitement, the sunset came, and we faced the problem of accommodation. The summer is the best season for touring in Dalian, thus all the rooms are reserved. Finally, we only asked for help from a taxi driver, and eventually he sent us to a hotel in Busan, which locates far from the city center. In the following days, we are all depressed, as a result of not having a tour guide, we just spent most of our time from one place to another one though the transportation in Dalian is not terrible. We just searched for our routine all the time.","[""With the statement of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, different people have different ideas depending on their own personalities and personal experience.

However it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people. Also, I think that young people have a chance to communicate with people more. Young people go to schools and meet friends. They can also join many activities outside of school. Older people may join in with some activities but there are not many activities for older people.

They are eager to leave their home towns and build up their own dreams and realize those dreams in prosperous cities. For example, in some developed countries such as Taiwan and Japan , young people enthusiastically move to those grand cities to pursue their future.

424,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work. are shown. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you would rather pay attention to the person or musician announcing the item than the announced item itself. Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportsmen or sportwomen are used in the ads.","['I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact.

Sometimes, someone asks why he/ or she can get everything that he/or she wants and I can't. In my opinion, the answer is very simple. It is necessary work and I work very hard to achieve my goals. People who are successful have three essential characteristics that frustrated people do not. The first is to take risks all the time, second they are confident in themselves and the last they are positive. First, people who are successful say yes to almost everything to do!. For example, I was working on a project in the pathology laboratory, but a colleague from my field invited me to work on a different project. I worked with him without thinking about the inconveniences of the result. when I accepted, I meant to study harder and for long hours to compensate for my deficiencies in something new. However, I did and we finished the project and published it. Secondly, usually these people are confident in themselves. They don't feel scared to begin something. In fact, they are always in continuing challenge and never think in fail. They know very well their limits and capabilities. In addition, these characteristics let them work in the best advantages of the rest of the people. For instance, I followed the tennis court to a famous basketball player. He knew his capability and effects better than anyone, so he worked specifically in his effects until he improved. As a result , he was the best basketball player of the year. This point is relevant for being successful, if I know my limitations.","[""Definitely, people who are successful take their life in continuous challenges.

430,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. In my opinion, if you understand the concept, you always have time to learn facts or dates. In children's education, for example, it's important to give them instruments to understand nature and society. I think it's not so important to fill them with dates and facts. Moreover, if a child understands a concept, he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life. If he learns a fact without understanding it, he will forget it in a month. For example, i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old, just because my teacher explained the meaning of them. I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explanation of them. If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it, the children have no sense and don't pay attention to it. The same is true in adult education. In the university of medicine, for example, it is much more important to understand how to visit a patient, than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body. You always have time to take a book and learn it.","[""I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

In my country, Japan, there are many young people who do not do anything; they are staying at home and they do not go to school, do not go to work, or do not do part-time jobs ; they do not want to do anything, or they do not know what they want to do. Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in. And many older people have worked for a long time in some office or in their home as housewives. So, they want to use the time for themselves this time. They know how to use the time moreover, they have desired if they quit jobs, they want to go hiking or traveling, spend their time doing their hobbies. They try to use the free time as they want, which is that they enjoy their life. There are two big differences between young people and older people.

436,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes I do agree with this statement. In my opinion, when a person invents something new which is not available on the market. He tries to include everything that he could do. This is a good thing. But when the time comes for advertising this product. The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he can get profits as fast as he can. Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones. When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give. Like to give a mobile phone headset, a car charger, a mobile phone carry case, some applications, games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones. When a customer looks at this kind of advertisement he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw in the advertisement. Then the shop keeper shows him, he does not like the item. Why ? Because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones. But they find that they are not original. This causes a lot of problems when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else. I would like to share an example that I experienced a year or two ago. There is a trademark that is really popular among ladies. It sells readymade clothes for women. And his logo is also very popular. A shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost half the price of the material the original shop is selling and he advertised it in various magazines and newspapers.

Some of them believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I am hesitant to agree with the statement, and the reasons are listed below. Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them. Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather. And I am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being, cars will become more popular. Admittedly, Many people think that the number of cars will be decreasing, because they cause a great deal of pollution, and people nowadays pay special attention to the environment. Nevertheless, I deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finally varnished, with the development of techniques. And we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by the UN, that a car made with the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before. In conclusion, though the cars face the problem that they pollute a great deal today, I think the number will not be fewer, because more and more people can afford them, and such great comfort and convenience they offer, and, the most important.","['The speed of development concerned technique is so fast today, and more and more speculate about what will happen in 20 years.

Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them. Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather. And I am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being, cars will become more popular. Admittedly, Many people think that the number of cars will be decreasing, because they cause a great deal of pollution, and people nowadays pay special attention to the environment. Nevertheless, I deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finally varnished, with the development of techniques. And we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by the UN, that a car made with the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before.', 'In conclusion, though the cars face the problem that they pollute a great deal today, I think the number will not be fewer, because more and more people can afford them, and such great comfort and convenience they offer, and, the most important.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
438,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Regarding the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones, i hold the view this is true. Regarding my opinion young people today have a lot more possibilities to create their life. First they have the opportunity to go to school a long way and afterwards study whatever they want to. Older people never had this great opportunity, nor the money for such a comfortable life. Second is the creation of a wide range of spare time activities. There are so many new possibilities for what one can do in leisure time, which did not exist in the time when the older people were young, and what they now cannot do any longer because of health problems. The variety goes from sports, culture, travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country. From this I want to move to the next point: foreign studies. Younger people don't even have the great opportunity to study, but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice. This is an important extraordinary experience, which has a great impact on later life. Living in a country for a period of time is something else than being on vacation. The young have the opportunity to learn really from other cultures and so probably develop a different view about many things in their early years of life. Older people can do this after years of work and can't take the chances in that way. But one also has to take into account the career chances offered to young people. With the money from the parents it is possible to live in a big city where many great companies are.","[""Regarding the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones, i hold the view this is true.

444,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I completely agree with this statement. I think there are various arguments to support it. To begin with, the growing number of cars is becoming a problem nowadays. In some cities, like London, they tried to find a solution to reduce the number of users by asking for a fee to drive into the city. Having so many cars in a confined area brings a lot of problems like pollution, parking problems, accidents without even thinking about the fact that so many cars consume a lot of fuel. Speaking of, it's abundance is dropping dangerously, and of course the price is equally expanding. It's becoming a luxury to drive now. Maybe there will be a restriction at some point, that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week. This could encourage people to drive with friends or colleagues to a work place for example. Thanks to this, fewer cars will be in use every day! I'm actually wondering if certain firms could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work. This could even bring people closer together. If you watch sciencefiction movies, you quickly realise that in most of them, there are not even cars! Cars have been replaced by some kind of machines flying around. Perhaps some scientists are currently trying to come up with new ideas to replace cars in an environmentally friendly way. An easier way to reduce the number of cars would also be to expand hugely the different forms of transport like trains, buses and subways in a way that cars will become unnecessary. If people realise that it's easier, cheaper and faster to go anywhere by train, bus or subway, cars will become useless. Sadly, this is still not the case nowadays. Certain areas are too remote to access them by any other way than by car. It is still easier and safer as well to ride home in the car in the middle of the night.","[""I completely agree with this statement. I think there are various arguments to support it.

For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it. But only after some days,I found the shoes hadn't got a good texture and were destroyed by walking. Then from these advertisements,I take a lesson:Don't believe adversisements! When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive,it means in other aspects,maybe they are controversial. When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not. Watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of the world.","[""I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth.

In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help. Once I worked for a local campaign , but I always helped people and did some volunteer work for a patient group. Till I want to work at a Global company. Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities? Give the poor person help to educate, get work and receive benefits.

Imagine if you missed your way in the forest, met some dangerous animals or got injured by accident, how would you continue your journey. In this situation, it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide. Your friends can help you if there are really some bad things happening. And since there is a tour guide, the opportunity to experience some bad things may decrease. So you can totally enjoy your trip without always worrying about all kinds of situations. second, common sense tells us that human beings are social animals.

470,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen.

As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer.

484,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like. Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound. At this time, if the teacher uses a fact which is like putting the method into an experiment.","[""I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

For example, some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging, cycling. Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them. However , if people want to enjoy life more and be more healthy , they should try new and risky sports. They shouldn't be afraid of them doing risky sports. In addition to this, taking risks is a fundamental issue because of the experience of life more deeply. For instance, i always do the most difficult tests first at school. Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it. Although it means taking risks, i prefer to do it and anytime i am not in a bad situation. Therefore, it is really beneficial. Last but not least, taking risks is also important to see which we can do the best. For example, a footballer prefers to run not too long in the exercises.

As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to travel by bus, subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because of improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have the chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway. That is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling. On the other hand people's choices will change while travelling along the cities; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropolis city to a tourist city in Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car. Because for making another guess; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all. Time is a valuable thing now; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay for a plane ticket for not being late for life.

Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything.

My private opinion is that it would be a great issue for the plants and humans to be healthy when fewer cars pollute the environment with gases and noise. Also it is necessary to build roads through woods and fields where many wild creatures live and so their homes were destroyed. People can also go by train, bus and bycicles or by foot or drive together with other people in one car, instead of driving alone. I think changes in getting oil will force this behaviour. Oil resources are decreasing remarkably in the next twenty years and the price of oil will increase strictly. So many car owners wo not afford the higher money for gas, because their income will stay the same. For the car industries and the jobs which are connected to them its a dramatic thing, because many people will lose their working places. When I think about all this it would be best to make now plans what we should do with the problem. First we could build new possibilities in transporting people and find new ways of exploring other resources we have on earth, instead of oil.

He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried.

510,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Success means inventing new things , which can be done by experiments and taking risks. It's not only restricted to successful people rather than to all people who are failures too. As success comes only by experiencing opposite results. It will be a new experience if we take risks and invent new things. This boosts our confidence and gives us a new experience. I agree that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already knew. Firstly successful people try new things because as they already tasted success in their life this gives confidence to work more by taking risks. Scientists are good examples of taking risks and trying new things. If scientists didn't try new things then we would nt be able to access the inventions which they made like pencillin, steam engine by james watt , aeroplane by William brother and so on.

While experimenting with new things we can get more knowledge in the subject which gives us soul satisfaction. Today we recognise scientists by their works , but we don't recognise a daily worker in a factory. Experiments are done by taking risks like astromers who take high risks while travelling to other planets or solar systems, in between they may lose their life by having collisions with other planets or by some technical problems. The best example of this is the well known actress Kalpana chawla , who did various experiments by taking risks.","[""Success means inventing new things , which can be done by experiments and taking risks.

All experiences bring to a conclusion which is the theory. But before arriving at the theory, scientists have to define the problem, make a hypothesis, practice, find a solution and draw a hypothesis.

519,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments. I believe most of these advertisements make products seem better because they only talk about good things about their products and they also use attractive things, such as people, to fascinate people. Since advertisements only show the benefits of that product, it seems very attractive to people. For example, my mother wanted to have a new vaccum. When she was watching the TV show, there was a commercial about a new vaccine. It said "" this is really powerful and useful! You should buy one! !""or that sort of thing. My mother was fascinated by that and next day, she went to the store and bought one. When she used it, she was really shocked. Although it was really powerful, it made a really loud noise and exhaled a lot of air. She was really mad that the advertisement did not say anything about the noise. Also since advertisements are to attract people, they try to make those nicer, which results in making products seem much better than they really are. For example, there was a new kind of CD player when I was 12 years old. I did not want to buy it since I had one already. However, I saw a commercial about it on TV and my favourite actress was advertising it! And it seemed to me it would be really cool to have it and if I had it, it would make me prettier. Next day, I ran to the store and bought it. However, it was really useless and it looked more plastic than the one that the actress had. Therefore I have never used it before.","['These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments.

Understanding things rather than learning things from facts from the class room helps the child to remember the things for longer and in inculcate new ideas in arriving at new ideas which help them in a long way to go. Also, learning concepts and ideas rather than learning facts which were written or told by some one helps to develop a desire for inviduality in the child and to evaluate the issues in a rather broad way standing different from others. For example one of my friends with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed an idea which he implemented in one of his projects and his project was selected to be demonstrated at NASA in the United states. and he was also rewarded by the president of my country as the best out standing research student in his age group.

539,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In our century, advertising is everywhere. We have to deal with and to be aware of advertising's tricks.

That is why they are ready to say everything which can convince you to buy it. People who do advertising have not the due to say the truth, their goal is only commercial, not educative. So how can we trust advertising? To illustrate this fact, we can take the example of Mc Donalds. If we look at the advertisement for this restaurant, we can learn that the meals are usually very dietetic, they are not bad for the health and the pictures of the meals are really teasing. But according to the experience of Mc Donalds' food in Supersize me, we can see that, this food is not good for the health. To give another example, we can consider make up advertisements. Women who play in these advertisements are models and if we put this make up on , we will not look at the model. Moreover, on her rimmel seems to be something very efficient but on us it does not have the same effect! So the product works better on TV or on advertisement than in real life. It is usually the same for washing products which wash our clothes more white than white. We have to keep in mind that the advertising world is an imaginary world where everything is perfect. That is not supposed to reflect the reality. That sells what we dream and that is what we buy when we buy a product after having seen it in an advertisement.","[""In our century, advertising is everywhere.

Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view it is right.

549,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family.

Also, if we look at the cut throat competition between the world there is not enough time for elderly people to enjoy life Although this same holds for younger people, they could be able to manage time for their enjoyment. It is also important for younger people to enjoy it because of the study burden because i believe that a healthy body can dwell in a healthy mind so for the future success they must be stress free. Enjoyment for younger people i believe that it is a dose for their tired nerves and if taken this dose will soothe their tired nerves and rejuvenate them for the upcomming responsibilities.

They have attended the proper opportunity of enjoyment at their time of development.","['yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family.

Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercials, radio commercials, magazines, books, newspapers, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show the correct information.

Second, concerning cost effectiveness, we should spend much more money on the tour which is followed by a tour guide. Third, I would like to travel with my family and my best friends.

In my opinion, older people enjoy their lives more because they know what true enjoyment and freedom to do anything is. Firstly, adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what true enjoyment is. Youngsters call playing computer games, going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life. However it is too small to be an enjoyment inone's life. Older people enjoy their lives in a greater range. For example, the head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit, directing people and going to dinner with his family, which are far more enjoyable than playing computer games. Secondly, adults have the freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy. For youngsters to enjoy their lives, there are numerous things that are not permitted to do, such as drinking, traveling without parents. However, there is no such barrier for adults. For example, my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business. Then he told me that he would go to these beautiful places and would come back with a better future. I, after listening to him, immediately thought of all the stress that I was getting from school and planned a trip alone. However, I could not make the trip because of my parents' disagreement. From that moment I deeply realized that I can enjoy my life when I grow up. People say that enjoyment equals happiness. However, it is not always true.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well. That means that it is so competitive in that area. If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others, it is rare to achieve success. Let's think about one example.

564,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Regarding the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones, i hold the view this is true. Regarding my opinion young people today have a lot more possibilities to create their life. First they have the opportunity to go to school a long way and afterwards study whatever they want to. Older people never had this great opportunity, nor the money for such a comfortable life. Second is the creation of a wide range of spare time activities. There are so many new possibilities for what one can do in leisure time, which did not exist in the time when the older people were young, and what they now cannot do any longer because of health problems. The variety goes from sports, culture, travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country. From this I want to move to the next point: foreign studies. Younger people don't even have the great opportunity to study, but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice. This is an important extraordinary experience, which has a great impact on later life. Living in a country for a period of time is something else than being on vacation. The young have the opportunity to learn really from other cultures and so probably develop a different view about many things in their early years of life. Older people can do this after years of work and can't take the chances in that way.","[""Regarding the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones, i hold the view this is true.

Older people never had this great opportunity, nor the money for such a comfortable life. Second is the creation of a wide range of spare time activities. There are so many new possibilities for what one can do in leisure time, which did not exist in the time when the older people were young, and what they now cannot do any longer because of health problems. The variety goes from sports, culture, travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country. From this I want to move to the next point: foreign studies. Younger people don't even have the great opportunity to study, but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice. This is an important extraordinary experience, which has a great impact on later life. Living in a country for a period of time is something else than being on vacation. The young have the opportunity to learn really from other cultures and so probably develop a different view about many things in their early years of life."", ""Older people can do this after years of work and can't take the chances in that way.""]","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

566,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do. If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first. People need to try new things. Furthermore,in schools. Teachers ask questions of their students. Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question.","['Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life.

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts.","['From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life.

The second reason is that, the tour guide will choose a good place for me better than I do. One time when I went to a new city I asked for a good place to go and how I could go there. At this point I lost the way. So it saves time going with a tour guide who will take me there in a short time. and i do not need to think of time. Finally, first think I could teach my son about travelling is to find a good tour guide. To save time and show him more places on one trip.', 'Which would be better to have a person who can help me to travel and enjoy my time without thinking of how and from where I have to go to that place.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

Meanwhile, Parents expect their children to focus on their studies. Students are not encouraged to help others. Children spend lots of time learning english, painting and music.

An other argument is that young people have no responsibility : they don't have money problems, or job problems or even children's problems , Their parents take care of everything so they don't have to worry about all those things that make life difficult. But in contradiction with all that i said before, i would point out that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way. adults have a larger experience which gives them a knowledge young people don't have.

596,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In an aspect of shot time,It seems more effective to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize how much information or how many facts we learned and knew. However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others. There are two aspects to all the information we face everyday. One is the fact that we can see easily. It is like a penonmenon in nature. We can believe what we can see. The other is the concept that we can see only when we study it and we understand it. If people understand a certain information, it means that people know how the information is formed, what the information and how they can apply it to others. It is good for students because they must have interest in the information when they can understand it totally and apply it to others. It can make students keep studying and learning. Lastly, understanding ideas is less boring than learning fats. Students do not like to learn something without certain reasons. They are not interested in learning hard and difficult facts. Therefore, we make them understand something to learn. Understanding is different from learning. It can give students a motive to learn and make them feel funny.

Nowadays, the price of airline tickets has gone down. its become cheaper and now a days there are many flights going daily internationally as well as domestically. recently i visited madras my family preferred going by plane because it saves time and there was hardly any difference in the cost. now a days only people do not have time for their personal comments and that men are replaced by machinery. may be twenty years down the line robbers and other machinery will replace man."", 'According to me there would definitely be a change in society less traffic more development in different modes of.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

601,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days. But personally I believe that education and society give young people the chance and the time to have contact with communities to help other people. First, the school focuses on the importance of volunteer work in the community these days, so that students give more time to do volunteer work than before. For example, when I was in high school, the teachers set up the volunteer committee which gives the information and chance to do volunteer work in the hospital to clean the rooms. In addition, the school produced an event where students pick up the trash around the school once a week. The experience of attending volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students. That experience gives me the chance to have contact with my community. I was very busy studying, but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities. According to the newspaper, the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer work these days. This example demonstrates that schools make enough opportunities for students to help their communities. Second, the community has a chance for young people to help their communities. For instance, In Tokyo, where I live, the number of robberies and fire accidents caused by people is increasing. Therefore, in my town, the committee of the town decide to ask young people to look around the town to protect them from accidents during the night. I attend this activity once a week. This example also shows that young people have a time to help the community because of their needs to defend themselves.","['Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days.

602,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In general I think that both understanding conceps and learning facts are the two faces of the same medal. I will try to explain here below all the connections between concepts and facts especially in science terms. All the big scientific discoveries depend on the observation of facts, but on the other hand it is important to know all the theories related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of the facts we are observing. To give an order to this matter I think that first (in a temporary order, not for its importance) students need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts, so in the first part of students' formation it is necessary for them to learn as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the matter and after they can understand and remember much more easily all facts connected with their studies. for example if you are studying the atomic structure, of course you need to know everything about chemistry and related theories. This example feats quite well to this essay, especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission. It happened that the woman, who was of course a physicist and had studied a lot of theory, was observing the facts about accelerated neutrons pushed against the nuclear part of a not stable atom. During the observation of the facts, she expected that, using enough energy, the neutron would link with the atom, instead it happened that the atom divided producing a large quantity of energy, and thanks to her previous study she understood she had discovered nuclear energy and atomic fission. In my last essay, I can say that the deepest concept knowledge would be useless if it wasn ` t used to learn how all these theories are connected with facts, and at the same time it would be useless if we know a lot of facts but without knowing how these facts link together.","[""In general I think that both understanding conceps and learning facts are the two faces of the same medal.

604,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yes i agree with the statement, it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts of a particular thing. Because it is more important for any one to have a clear idea about that particular thing to work on it. I would explain with an example,when i am doing my first semester of my undergraduate studies i usually do my assignments with out understanding them and with out any clear idea about the topic given. i used to submit my assignments in this way only. when my examination is nearing,i dont have any idea about the topics because i didn't work on them clearly. Because,i thought just submitting my assignments on time would help me in the examination,but when i appeared in the exam i could not do well because i did nt have any idea of the concept of the work. this makes my grades lower. when the next assignment was given i used to work on it for a long time and tried to get a clear idea about the topic and made my assignments. this helped me a lot in the final examination to succeed and got a better grade. this is because understanding the concept of that made me do well in the examination. Another example is that,when an experiment is explained in a class room it is again asked to do the same one in thelaboratory. i used to neglect to concentrate on the laboratory class. when i used to revise the topics covered after so many days, i used to forget the particular thing explained in the class room and i again should see the particular professor for the left over one. If i had performed the practical thing in the laboratory i would get a clear idea and the concept of the topic and would have remembered the thing on that topic. so i conclude that it is more important for students to understand the clear concept than it is for them to learn facts because understanding the ideas and the concept of the topic would do more than fact.","[""Yes i agree with the statement, it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts of a particular thing.

We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field.

606,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this statement. No matter whether successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing. Successful people try new things and taking risks are the best thing that they need to do. For example, an animal professor who discovers medicine for humans. If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have, so this is not called discovery and they are no longer needed. Of course they need to find new medicines and it involves risks because they test animals. Another example is students who are successful in studying. Why are they successful? The reason is they already try new things such as reading a lot of different books and communicating with teachers. The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required. If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful students? They will stay the same without studying new things. They cannot only study what they know well. Otherwise, they cannot be open-minded. For me, I have a personal story about this topic. I am trying new things and also taking risks. I came to America for study. I am trying to study new cultures and languages. I am not successful yet, but I am trying to be successful. Also this is a risk for me because my parents cannot afford me to study at university in America. The tuition is too high. My parents have to take care of me and my brother.

607,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"To have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to learn many things in different fields of study. To specialize in one specific subject is to look at one thing from one point of view. In my opinion, it is better to have both of them as a part of your academic development, and they are both equally important. What truly happens in every person's academic development is that this person goes through different equally important stages. In the first stages of a child's life, this child learns how to speak, and then he or she learns how to write. This is general information that everyone should start with at the beginning of their academic life. Then comes school, whatever, or wherever this person gets their education is all called school; Although, there are some differences that occur at the level of that education. In school, people are taught all the essentials of life, and a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, including different sciences, mathematics, arts, music, and languages. These are the foundations each and every one of us need in our life. As school education comes to an end, different people start to specialize in different subjects of their interests. Later on in life, we are approached by university; by we, i am referring to people who are looking to pursue further education. University is where we are supposed to narrow our choices down, and choose specific fields of study. That is when it is proper for a person to specialize in one specific subject; in other words, major in something they are attracted to. In the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their lives, and that is why they have to choose something they truly love. In conclusion, to have broad knowledge of an academic subject, or to specialize in another are all equally important. You have to get a broad education first, and then narrow it down to what comforts you most.

613,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Do you try to learn facts without understanding the ideas and concepts. Nobody can get the facts without understanding the ideas and the concepts I believe that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of details and mistakes. Details are important for the students to understand anything that is not clear. Concepts and ideas should be understood by the students to know how it works. For example, If you understand your major by using the concepts and ideas of the major, you will understand how machines work because you understand the ideas of the machine. You will have more details about the machine. Students should understand ideas and concepts to learn the facts with more details. Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts. Less mistakes are important to have a great job to learn the facts because the facts mean that the lack of mistakes. for example, if the student understands ideas and concepts, they will have fewer mistakes than if they misunderstand them. If you have a device to improve, you should understand all the parts of this device to have fewer mistakes. If you do not understand the ideas and concepts, you can not improve this device. Also, if you improve the device without understanding the ideas and the concepts, you will have many mistakes that can be wrong for the student.

Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas.

The summer is the best season for touring in Dalian, thus all the rooms are reserved. Finally, we only asked for help from a taxi driver, and eventually he sent us to a hotel in Busan, which locates far from the city center.

627,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. From my point of view there are a lot of things that make me feel like agreeing with this statement. For example younger people are usually not that settled or depending on other people , which makes you enjoy life more and live freely. In younger years one doesn't think that much about the difficulties of life that may appear later on, such as illnesses or financial security problems. Furthermore one usually goes to college or university in younger years where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway, apart from some learning times. So yes, I would say that the circumstances in your younger years make it often easier to really enjoy life than in older years. But on the other hand I think- and I can only think about it because I am in my younger years at the moment - older people as well have their very own way of enjoying life. Surely they'll do it in a different way because it's not all about parties and having fun, but with a life-experience I am sure one can enjoy life at a different level. Looking back on what life offered for you, everything you've already been able to enjoy and all the goods and bads you've gone through I think one can enjoy life as much as young people.","[""The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do.

628,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are. Thirdly, for many factories and supermarkets or sales, maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements. Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheating advertisements can perfect products.","['When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are. Thirdly, for many factories and supermarkets or sales, maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements.', 'Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheating advertisements can perfect products.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
629,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students can learn about many things in school. When students learn new things, It is very important for students to know what they are learning from classes. And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts. I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from text books. To understand the basic idea is not simply but, in my opinion, it can expand the student's abilities of thinking and creation. Understanding new ideas and concepts can take a long time and sometimes it could take a few decades for students. It can be a problem learning new things. That's why some instructors and students take shortcuts to learn new things. For example, when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio, so called 'Golden ratio' which is believed to be the perfect proportion for every object. It is a very difficult theory to understand for freshmen and it could take more than 2years, but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory. Even though it is difficult to understand the ideas, students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it. It can be easy to create new things with the basic concepts. For instance, a musician who understands the principles of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and rhythms using the basic music element. Consequently, I recommend understanding the main ideas when students learn new things. Even though it is a hard and difficult way to learn about new things, after understanding the notion from the basics.","[""Students can learn about many things in school.

630,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I disagree with this, because it's also a sort of lying to their customers. I understand that they are trying to sell their products alot, but they have to think about their customers to not be disappointed. I really enjoy watching TV, and there are lots of advertisements during the show break. Watching those advertisements makes me laugh, because I know that things will never happen. A few years ago, I saw an advertisement for a hair shampoo on TV, so I decided to try that because I thought my hair would be like the models on TV. I bought that shampoo, and tried it. On the first day, I did not see any difference, so I thought it took a while to be silky. I waited. Nothing happened. That shampoo was the same as the other products. Not one thing was different or special except the nice smell. I've been using it for a few years now, but still, nothing seems to happen. They are really trying hard to grab people's attention, but advertising to trick people is not good. Some people will not care much, but some people can be serious.","[""I disagree with this, because it's also a sort of lying to their customers.

The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping.

Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them.

One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law.","['I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons.

647,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with this statement because I think that sometimes most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The advertisement is made generally to achieve the customer attention because in this way there is more possibility that the customer will buy the product. There are some people that study for a lot of years to learn the rules of marketing and to learn the right ways to achieve their customers. Today, on television, we can see a lot of beautiful advertisements. We are often interested and enjoied by them, but when we buy these products in a supermarket, we are often not so happy with our purchase. I think that often the advertisements that I see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention. For example next week I saw the advertisement forBarilla, a famous firm that produces some types of pasta, and I thought that this was a little film. It`s beautiful because it talks about life, the ways that children have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her baby, through all of this the advertisement also speaks also of a new type of pasta called ""piccolini"". I think that this is a beautiful advertisement and each time that I watch it on tv I really want to buy the product. A few days after I had seen this advertisement I had eaten this type of pasta and I understood that it was not so good as I believed, infact I prefer the normal type of Barilla pasta so much. Therefore I say that often most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example I can understand in this case of pasta.","['I agree with this statement because I think that sometimes most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

They do not have a savings account , they like to use visas,and spend more money in their habits. In fact ,they do not have a plan for the future. Second,Young people find it easier to pay attention to some new things. They will be mad about computer games, cars, clothes and so on. At that time , they will spend more money and more time on it. Do not say i am young, i still have a lot of time to do my future work. That is wrong, Because you do not have that money to enjoy your life. You only use older people's money to enrich your life. For older people , their situation is the opposite. They will not pay attention to new things , they just want themselves to have good final lives. Third , Young people will not think about their families, they think their lives are more important. They will say i must enjoy my life without odler people. They do not want to stay with their mother or father. They only know friends. Although there are age problems between older people and young people and they will not enjoy life together, young people do not have any points about their family. Anyway, young people.","[""Things are changing every day. In the next 50 years , you could not believe that people can use computers to do a lot of things. You could not believe somethings which happenedToday. So Young people are changing also, they enjoy their lives more than older people do. There are three points that can prove this. First,young people will not think about when they become old what will happen. They just want to enjoy their lives now. For Older people ,there is a big difference. Older people will think about their family, their retirement payments, their future lives. They will save money for that. They will also reduce their ativities for health.

665,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies. Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as the Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of the computer all day and play games. They believe computers bring more fun into their life. Some young people just like to go shopping. As a result, they all lack interest in taking part in communites, In conclusion, I think there are many reasons that lead to this result. it is a negative phenomenon, so I suggest society, their parents and teachers should pay more attention to resolving this problem.","['Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays.

666,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"To answer this question , i will organize it in two parts. The first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people, and (even if i'm not so old) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than younger  people. We all remember the first time , the first time we made love, the first time we went to highschool, the first time we smoked a cigarette. I think this is one of the reasons we might say younger people can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders, just because everything they do is known. Teenage years are the period where you have lots of experiences, it's an adventure, you discover all the time. I remember my teenage years. It was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i've experienced during this period. i was always going to partys, when i was 15 me and my friend would go to a night club and everything had an important impact on me because it was known. An other argument is that young people have no responsibility : they don't have money problems, or job problems or even children's problems , Their parents take care of everything so they don't have to worry about all those things that make life difficult. But in contradiction with all that i said before, i would point out that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way. adults have a larger experience which gives them a knowledge young people don't have. Having this experience they can appreciate things young people wouldn't even care about. It's hard for me to give examples because i don't consider myself as a complete adult. But maybe adults can enjoy very interesting things like a good glass of an old Whiskey for example. One day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like. I think old people, as they know more about life, can enjoy it even more. On the other hand, young people don't have the time to establish important projects. What is life about after all? i think life is about being happy and doing such wonderful things as children. Adults have the opportunity to live this kind of wonderful project. They have the opportunity to make plans.","[""To answer this question , i will organize it in two parts.

667,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Without questions,I agree with this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do. I have two reasons for this opinion: energy and freedom. First of all, I think that young people are able to exercise harder than older people because they are young, so they have a lot of energy in general. In my grandfather's case, he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even huge things when he was 21 years old. Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured himself when he was in junior high-school. I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster and play some sports when you are 70 years old. Secondly, I claim that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think. It is because older people have their husbands or wives in many cases.","[""Without questions,I agree with this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do.

Some think that doing what they already know how to do well is better, contrary to those who think that trying new things and taking risks is more important to be successful.

However , if people want to enjoy life more and be more healthy , they should try new and risky sports. They shouldn't be afraid of them doing risky sports.

""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands. Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs. they feel experimenting with them is an enjoyment. But those r not really enjoyable things in fact which apoil the carrier of the youngster. those kinds of enjoyment are restricted and enjoyment should be done so that he has a good time and good memories which he can share with his young generation. Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more ability to enjoy themselves. Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment. But older people cannot have as much enjoyment as youngsters as they have no energy and capability to enjoy themselves. Older people will have to think about their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories. Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying themselves.

679,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In this newspaper, people easily find the advertisements, they take place everywhere. People can find the advertisements not only on the TV, but also in the newspapers. Furthermore, people buy many things because of the advertisements. The advertisements always look really good and make people want to spend money on them. In my opinion, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are the owners want to earn money, and the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated. The first reason is because the owners want to earn money from these commodities. For instance, if the advertisements look really terrible, no one would want to buy them and spend their money on them. Therefore, the owners willn't get any money and welfare from them. Secondly, most of the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated. For example, the iPOD is really fashionable these days. The iPOD advertisements always say that it can contain over 1,000 songs and won't run out of batteries at least 14 hours. However, after I spent my money that came from my salary for a part time job, I was really sad about that.","[""In this newspaper, people easily find the advertisements, they take place everywhere.

But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease. On the contrary to teenagers, adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoying life.

682,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In this text i will discuss the question "" Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". First I have to say that everybody will be old one day and this is my first argument. When young people think ""I will be old sometime"" they often think of ""but not yet and I have enough time to enjoy my life! "". Then young people often do something forbidden or something ""freaky"". For example I read about parcour. Parcour means that you run across a city and always run straight on even if there are cars, garages and houses. You just climb up the wall and then jump down and that is what many young people do. For older people enjoying life is often spending time withfamily, going travelling and reading something in which they are interested. For example can everybody remember his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would never have allowed or something like that? And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels? Older people mostly just enjoy their life. But young people are often not allowed to do the things they want to do and often the parents are the reason for that. So the real question is who can actually enjoy his life? but this would take too long so i will write my opinion on the question ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"" I think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. I think that, because i often hear stories about other people being very ill or having pain everywhere and like this you can't enjoy life. Young people often do forbidden things and that gives them a kick and the thing with girlfriends is although giving young people a feeling of enjoying their life.","['In this text i will discuss the question "" Young people enjoy life more than older people do"".

688,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people.

In order to explain this topic, we can show that this is a controversial point, depending on which condition you look at this situation. First of all, it's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing very quickly, and there are more and more cars on the road. This certainly leads to the increasing of the price of the train and the price of tickets in this last ten years. But, you can tell, that in the industry are trying to change this problem, not by trying to reduce the car industry, but by trying to find a new way not to pollutethe planet, like by biocarburant. Furthermore, It's nearly impossible to avoid people using their car, like for working people, or people living far away. And in addition, today, having a car, is also to be part of the social world, to be autonomous. However, You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear. When you see the fast evolution of all the other ways to be driven. Furthermore, lots of people prefer public transport as a cheaper way to go to work, and governments understand this and are developing this, like in hong kong, where you can do everything without anycar, or in London, where the city doesn't allowany car. Or even in strasbourg where the french government make cheaper tickets in order to encourage people to let their car at home. In addition, we can not plan clearly in which way the world will evolve. If you take as an example a developed country, because it's the one who will be more affected by this matter, you can already tell how they already try to develop other ways to move in and outside of their country. Take as an example, the train development and the decrease in the price in some companies helped by government. In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of cars on the road in twenty years, in my opinion, I can say I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road, this due to the evolution of the population. But with the news technologies, the bad effects of this on the environment and as a bigger scale on the planet, can be reduced, which is a good point, and as a matter of fact that the petrol resources in the world became really rare, which can be a real turn in the car industry, I hope in a good way.","[""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

695,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Nowadays young people are confronting increasing pressure from working and studying, and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday. Although it is true, I still persist that young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is generally accepted that almost all products of new technology are accepted, mastered and being used by young people first, so do the ones to provide convenience and enjoy themselves. Young students, for example, have got used to using cell-phones while their grand parents still use old and big normal telephones. Although airplanes have been common in China for tens of years, some older people still refuse to travel by airplane, because they think it is dangerous and a waste of money. Old people refuse to or don't know how to use many new products and can hardly receive benefits from modern society than young people. Besides, it is obvious that young people are the natural leaders of the new fashion, and it is also a common sense that entertainment, which is highly developed in modern cities, is always first accepted by young people. For instance, while I went to bars with my friends in my free time, my mother merely stayed at home doing nearly nothing even though she had enough free time. Only when she was invited to a bar by her younger friends did she find it really a good place to get released. Another fact is that a recent social study indicates that less than 70 percent of people who live in big cities of China receive benefits from new technology, and few of them are old people whose age is above 55. Moreover, enjoying life is not only shown through using the new products and enjoying entertainments, but also through activities in society. The social concept of older people is not OPEN enough even though freedom and democracy of society are progressing rapidly, especially in China. Several researches have already pointed out that people who are older than 48 are hard to accept the new concept of society, and by this they can hardly enjoy real freedom and democracy, which plays an important role in young people's daily life. From social activities I can release myself and win admire from others, which is essential to keep me feeling well.","[""Nowadays young people are confronting increasing pressure from working and studying, and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday.

697,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'.

If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses. He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job. He can make more effort to learn those things. Because he has to enter that field to work. then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts.

The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price. He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price. Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets success and another takes a regular film which is a flop,who again takes the risk of talking about another variety film, definitely the successful one. So I agree that successful people take risks rather than only doing what they already know. I hope most people agree with the topic because every one knows the value of success in life.","[""It's a very interesting topic to write on.

I agree with the statement because they are more energetic and have a great physical and mental ability to work,to earn,to play and what not. ""A fit body has better brains"" and this makes the young generation enjoy life more. Older people are capable of giving ideas based on their experiences but could not implement them as they lag the physical fitness required for heavy work and also being slower at doing a work.

At the age of 16 they learn to apply the ideas which help in inventing new devices or theories that were unsolved or remained a mystery so long. Also the future of the nation depends undoubtedly on the hands of the younger generation.

If a job is allocated to a group of young individuals they take that work as a challenge,strive to complete it as quickly as possible and they even enjoy working for something they want to. Younger people look for enjoyment in every work they do. For example I enjoy working for my studies,for my career and earning for my family and helping others to develop.

In addition , the course in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomena such as global warming , soil erosion, and so on which make me a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, I agree that students must focus on understanding rather than learning facts since they would be logical. secondly, as students under standing ideas, they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which make all around the world thrive more than before. For example, when I was a middle school student, I would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness. Back then ,particularly, my geography teacher had a special characteristic which explained to understanding ideas until a number of students perfectly grasped the contents of geography. As a result, I could be a specialist in geography and at the same time I had a major in geography atuniversity. Therefore, I prefer to understand ideas to concepts.

Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in. And many older people have worked for a long time in some office or in their home as housewives. So, they want to use the time for themselves this time. They know how to use the time moreover, they have desired if they quit jobs, they want to go hiking or traveling, spend their time doing their hobbies. They try to use the free time as they want, which is that they enjoy their life. There are two big differences between young people and older people.

743,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like. Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound. At this time, if the teacher uses a fact which is like putting the method into an experiment. The teacher can show the wave by pressing the water and the student can see what the water wave is like.

744,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with this statement. This statement isn't true for all young people. In my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping. I have been a scout leader for four years. I give my free time to care for children, to think about games which I can play with them and to help them if there is any problem. I dont get any money for this, I do this because I like it and have fun almost always. Of course there are situations where I am nervous and tired of entertaining children, but all bad emotions vanishes if you can make these kids happy. So it depends on the education and the surroundings of a young person, whether he (or she) is willing to help his (or her) community. Not all people have this social ambition that I have. I can imagine there are people who only want e. g. to get a high paid job or to be the best in the class etc. They want to obtain their goal without caring about other people. But I think that there were always such people who did nt care. When I read this statement, I wonder what enough means. Who decides what or how much help is enough? I think there isn't a right answer. Everyone should find out for themselves what time they would like to spend helping them. Considering jobs which are paid there are other points. All men who dont want to go into the army have to do social work for one year. They have to care for disabled humans or very poor people.

745,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with the statement. In many years, since cars were created and got on sale, people have used them and had them in their lives as their legs to go where they want to go. And cars also contribute to carrying stuff faster and easier, not just people. Today, cars are needed by the world and people's lives as I wrote. But you know what cars need to move. That is gas. People have also used a lot of gas along with cars since they started to drive cars. But it led to oil that creates gas to be used up from the underground of the earth faster. If people didn't touch it, it wouldn't happen. But the spending or waste of gas is still going on now. So, waste of oils is caused by using up of them. That is about why countries that have oil are making oil ( gas ) prices higher and higher. Then, who will need more cars that use gas even more than now in the future? Looking at the problem, scientists are trying to find or create new kinds of fuels to move the cars for gas. For example, there is an interest in getting new fuels. They are finding the way out to get fuels from sugar. When sugar gets heated up, it makes a kind of alcohol. And that can be used for cars only if they are mixed with gas. Now, suger alcohols can't be new fuels being used by themselves, but scientists believe that they will finally be successful in making them complete and people will be able to start using them to drive their cars. Actually, this work is going well now by the scientists. And That's why I said people wouldn't need any more cars moved by gas. That can be said that it is not so far people have started riding cars with new fuels, I think.","[""I agree with the statement.

People have also used a lot of gas along with cars since they started to drive cars. But it led to oil that creates gas to be used up from the underground of the earth faster. If people didn't touch it, it wouldn't happen. But the spending or waste of gas is still going on now. So, waste of oils is caused by using up of them. That is about why countries that have oil are making oil ( gas ) prices higher and higher. Then, who will need more cars that use gas even more than now in the future? Looking at the problem, scientists are trying to find or create new kinds of fuels to move the cars for gas. For example, there is an interest in getting new fuels. They are finding the way out to get fuels from sugar. When sugar gets heated up, it makes a kind of alcohol. And that can be used for cars only if they are mixed with gas. Now, suger alcohols can't be new fuels being used by themselves, but scientists believe that they will finally be successful in making them complete and people will be able to start using them to drive their cars. Actually, this work is going well now by the scientists. And That's why I said people wouldn't need any more cars moved by gas."", 'That can be said that it is not so far people have started riding cars with new fuels, I think.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

764,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","This is a very diplomatic statement to say that the use of cars will decrease in the future. As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them. In this fast growing society, cars do play a major significant role, as they do be very helpful for quicker transportation, because time once lost cannot be regained, and for the world twenty years from now, time will play a very prominent role. There are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars, which would become a major resource for growing the usage of cars in the future. By using this type of car, they have many advantages like the faster mode of transportation, which not only improves one's only status but improves the whole economic development of the country. Because to compete with the development of the countries the citizens should be using their time to the fullest. and the other one is a pollution free environment, which is very important now due to global warming coming as a major consequence innature. In addition its really very hard for any citizen to wait for government mass transportation , who is in an emergency, or planning to go for a picnic with his family members or so and would be more suitable to have his own car than rely on any others. The only thought which brings us to the conclusion that in the next twenty years the number of cars will be decreased is the problems of pollution, traffic congestion, or the scarcity of petrolium products, but there are many alternatives which have been taken as substitutes to these problems. and the usage of modern improvisation in this aspect would capture the imagination of the nation for the alternative use. and these have been proved through analysis of the last 2-3 years in most of the parts of the world.","[""This is a very diplomatic statement to say that the use of cars will decrease in the future. As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them.

In addition , the course in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomena such as global warming , soil erosion, and so on which make me a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, I agree that students must focus on understanding rather than learning facts since they would be logical. secondly, as students under standing ideas, they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which make all around the world thrive more than before. For example, when I was a middle school student, I would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness. Back then ,particularly, my geography teacher had a special characteristic which explained to understanding ideas until a number of students perfectly grasped the contents of geography. As a result, I could be a specialist in geography and at the same time I had a major in geography atuniversity.

Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it, I learnt several new rules about sport, so it encourages me to play it. The other example is about risky. I took a PhD in education for two years in my country. I want to change my education place even if it has many risks. These are spending alot of money, passing the toefl exam, and completing a new phd education in theUS."", ""They didn't know how much money I spent before.""]","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

782,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Have you ever an uncomfortable feeling, when you watch the mass media because of news? There is so much news and new information in mass media such as newspapers, TV, radio. Sometimes, we should think about whether it is true or not. Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For the person who wants to know, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point. Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product. For instance, as you know, fast food is not good for your health. However, the companies which produce fast food, they usually hide the fact which can cause problems for the body like cancer. In particular, for children, they can be addicted to fast food because they just see the advertisement which looks delicious. Secondly, the advertisements can advertise the thing in the wrong way, It means the truth can be hidden by force. In illustrative, there are specific rumors about a newspaper company in my country. That is about bad connections between government and newspaper. Actually, nobody doesn't know this fact. but the certain thing is that they usually have good speeches about the government. In addition, the fact is different depending on the view. In fact, the advertisements or some group can abuse the power to show. Because, when the power considers the thing, the thing can easily follow the power role. In conclusion, there are two reasons why an advertisement can make products better than they really are.","[""Have you ever an uncomfortable feeling, when you watch the mass media because of news?

783,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago. To improve its condition, I attend this activity.","[""I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

784,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place. Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there. They may lose their way, and be in trouble with the particular language and culture. For example, American children who go to Singapore receive a heavy punishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place.","['As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide.

Is it necessary to show all those virtues to be successful? Is it the only condition to be successful? On the one hand, successful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful.

787,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It seems that there has been an argument that young people in this society spend a lot of time helping their communities. There are some points of views that students already participate in enough communities. However, in my opinion this cannot be true in terms of. In this essay. I will briefly present two reasons supporting my opinion. Most of all, individualism causes young people nowadays not to concern themselves about their communities. Most families in this country have one or two children, and they cannot have a chance to experience cooperation. They grew up only with their parents and without any siblings so it is hard to know how to share or yield for others that can learn from a large family. As a result, these children tend to behave individually and do not think about others who need help. This is the main reason why I think young people hardly help others in their communities. Moreover, schools and other organizations require students to do something for society without their own will. What I mean is that this requirement has a bad influence on students. It may help students spend at least time volunteering but they will avoid helping others because of this rule, which is essential to go to a good school or get a better job in our country. In my opinion, helping someone that they don't want to do makes them not do any volunteer work except required time.

791,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting. A specialist is the man who soeciallyizes in more than one subject. The famous English detectives in the novels are good at detective and music. Such examples can be seen in every day life. A man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so.","['It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not.

But in real life, this means life after school, the time you need to work for your money to survive, it is better to understand things. A person not able to understand what she or he is doing is not able to develop an idea to find mistakes and eliminate them. A person who is able to do this would be much more successful in her/his job, just because of being able to make the way of working more effective. In school this kind of understanding and finding solutions to problems should be taught. Another reason why a theme should be understood is because of fun. Fun motivates us to go on, to do more. For some people it might be perfect to learn by heart, but most of them get bored. The more effective way is to support the wishes of people to understand (who do not know the most frequently asked question of a child:""Why?

796,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"These days, so many people hold the opinion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experience, life style and emotional environment. However some peoplen'tdon't. They hold the opinion that successful people would try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages. From my personal perspective, i would prefer the second opinion. first of all, doing what they already know how to do well is safer to get success, however, it may also make you lose something that may even more important. Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you only do what you already know at your times, you may fall behind the times. So its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages. the most valuable benefit of my opinion is that trying new things and taking risks may lead you to get more experience in the changing world, you may never lose any information. And that is what the first opinion would never achieve. What's more the advantages of my opinion are bigger than its disadvantages. So many people would think there are too many risks when trying new things and it may lead you to lose more. However, the more risks you get, the bigger seed you receive and that is the difference between successful people and normal people. But successful people are not those taking risks blindly, they think several times about whether they should do it or not until it is possible for them to do it. After understanding, the reasoning above, it is quite safe now to say,.","[""These days, so many people hold the opinion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experience, life style and emotional environment. However some peoplen'tdon't. They hold the opinion that successful people would try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages. From my personal perspective, i would prefer the second opinion. first of all, doing what they already know how to do well is safer to get success, however, it may also make you lose something that may even more important. Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you only do what you already know at your times, you may fall behind the times. So its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages. the most valuable benefit of my opinion is that trying new things and taking risks may lead you to get more experience in the changing world, you may never lose any information. And that is what the first opinion would never achieve. What's more the advantages of my opinion are bigger than its disadvantages. So many people would think there are too many risks when trying new things and it may lead you to lose more. However, the more risks you get, the bigger seed you receive and that is the difference between successful people and normal people.

797,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement. To me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies, so the entire population depends on advertisements which show ""incredible products"" which can resolve many different problems, such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain, or how to repair a part of the furniture; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program. In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and wastes a lot ofmoney. For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one). The philosopher Karl Marx, in the 19th century, said this: "". Religion is the object of all populations. "": to me this expression may be changed in this new form:"". Advertisements are the object of people. "", and it's really related to today's situation.","['I agree with the statement.

It is not only that they take risks that lead them to success , but it is also the commitment and the sacrifices they make along the way to success. For example this year's Oscar winner for best director Martin SCORSESE ,has committed his life to a career of directing movies. For many years he made films that others did not dare to make. For many years he was nominated for the Oscar but remained empty handed. But he did not yield and he continued to make movies with the same enthusiasm and resolution , always trying something different and new , which finally brought him the award.

That`s the reason because a lot of people do a lot of different jobs at the beginning hoping to find the right one. The purpose of man is to find the best way to live, at least for himself. When he finally finds a job that he thinks is good enough for his aims, he will not do anything else, he will not find another job to replace it, maybe he will try to improve his job or find a secondary job. That`s why this situation gives him stability and he will feel safe. That could be the reason because even successful people try new things rather than ordinary people.

816,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Knowledge is power.

Knowledge opens a lot of doors, but will not keep you in a small circle. I don't want to be misunderstood. Specializing in a topic or subject is not bad but this can't be the only thing you know.

""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better than younger people. But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world. The older people have minds that are worn out, by age , by time. Whereas a younger mind has a lot of ideas to offer. These are fresh brains, that have come right from college, filled with all sorts of new tools and the vigour to put those tools to action. And also there is no burden of a family to support. A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife, his children, his home. , this list can go endless.

We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships.

829,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts. My choice is based on two reasons. The first reason is that, if you learn facts, you have direct contact with reality. For example, at university, you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than if you follow a lesson of theory. This is a good way not only for a student, but also for a worker. In fact, if a worker has worked all of the day, he or she learns more things than if he or she follows a lesson of theory. I know my uncle's experience can be taken as an example. In fact, he has followed a course to work in a chemistry industry, but he has learnt the real way of working only when he has started to work in the chemistry industry. The second reason is that learning facts helps a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying. For example, I remember that, when I followed the course in the ""Way of Transport"", the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken of in how a naval motor is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built together. To conclude, I don't agree with the sentence because it is not true that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts.","['I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts.

But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons why I have no confidence in them, and I will explore a few primary ones here. To begin with, we can learn the ideas and concepts during studying factors. Teachers will be able to teach the student the ideas and concept by teaching a specific fact. Let's take a look at a physics class. At the very beginning , the teacher gives the class a specific problem, and asks them to solve it. The student might not be able to solve it, so the teacher could give some conceptional suggestions that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think about it again. And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept. Further more, why do we learn ideas and concepts ? For practical work, of course. So, why don't we learn something that is more practical? Learning facts will lead us to work directly, and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theories or concepts, and this would save much more time.","[""Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors.

836,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although both young and older people can live a fascinating life, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people. This may be because young people have wonderful dreams about life, they are healthier, and finally, they have less responsibilities. Having dreams and aims is one of the most important things that make young people more enjoyable in life. Young people have many goals that they want to achieve, for example they want to achieve good education, a high position. Also, they dream of a wonderful wife/husband and a happy life, and they make their best efforts to achieve these dreams. Expecting and anticipation of a better future is a main source of happiness. Some, may argue that older people also have dreams and goals, but ,in my opinion, they face and experience real life which may be hard and disappointing. Another factor is, health is very important to enjoy life. When you are in good health, you can do any thing. You can make any effort you want, any kind of sport, any activity. Illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy. When you are ill, you should take care of your health; you should not do any hard activity, any excessive exertion, and can only do some kinds of sports.","['Although both young and older people can live a fascinating life, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people.

However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least.","[""Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products.

844,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with this statement. I think that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important for several experiences. Also, it is useful in several situations. First of all, I think that people who have knowledge about anything are respected by other people. If the teacher knows not only English but also science, when he or she is asked by his or her students, he or she can answer smoothly. And, they can answer their question. In my case, my English teacher has knowledge of anything. For example, he knows about the art, the history of the living, and the lives of other countries' tribes. When I talked with him about these subjects, I was surprised and thought that I could learn various things from him as my teacher.

I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices.","['Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject.

So inorder to save my precious time i surely go on a trip with a. tour guide. If we go to a new place,its better if we have any local person who can call us to tell us about the history of that place. Mostly locals know better than the scholars who did research into that place. Because they will get all the information from their elders. Not only that the tour guide can also take visitors to different parts of the place from forests to rich green agricultural areas. In this way visitors can explore from wild animals to small beautiful local birds. Secondly, a tour guide can show more places in less time. Anyway it may take somuch time.","['Everyone wants to know about the world around him or her for better understanding of different cultural back groundsand also to explore new things.

This will be hard for an old person to do or it may not be suitable for an old person to do something like electronic games. For most young people they like to do hard or dangerousactivities.

880,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I disagree with the statement that successful people do not try new things and they use their previous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task. One of the examples I can remember of this is that a girl who always sat with me in my lunch period. She always worked very hard and I could see that she was a successful person and also will be in the future from what I saw of her. One day when she was doing her homework in front of me, I could not even tell what she was studying since it seemed like a difficult thing to me, she asked me if I could understand the question asked in the homework. I told her it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she can't even figure out. So she asked me what she should do so I told her to ask her classmates and ask them what they had answered. But she said no to that and said she is the smartest in the class and all the people are not very intelligent as she is so she can not take a risk. That response was beyond my expectations of what she would say. My personal thought was to ask a friend or two so she got a feeling of how she should answer the question but since she thinks she knows what to do better than the others, she did not want to take a risk of getting the answer wrong. In a way, I think since it's just a homework assignment, she can just ask people around her.","[""I disagree with the statement that successful people do not try new things and they use their previous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task.

885,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The issue at hand is whether or not young people give enough time to helping their communities. This is an important topic because it relates to community development. In my opinion young people help their communities in many ways which certainly consumes their time. A main reason for this view is that young people often come out to help their communities in times of disaster. For example if an earthquake hits a particular area then youn ones come out in that area to collect the money from all over the world. They advertise it in the paper, on the internet, on TV and everywhere else possible. Not only that, young people earn their salary to help their community. To organise and collect money for such noble causes, it certainly demands time. Thus, young people are giving their valuable time to help their community. Another reason for my point of view is that young people devote a lot of time to research and for carrying out innovations. For example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young people right from the day of their childhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly.","['The issue at hand is whether or not young people give enough time to helping their communities.

When he got up in the morning, he went to the flowershop and looked for the special flower seeds. And when he got back home, he sprayed the water on the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it. The second reason is that not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots offriends.

In the advertisements for tobacco, we can see bad images of tobacco, but many smokers don't stop smoking in spite of these advertisements. My friends watch these advertisements for tobacco everyday, but keep smoking. The advertisements for medicine have a restriction, so a medicine company can't use an expression which tells more effects than it really are. But about other products besides tobacco and medicine, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the TV commercials, beautiful women and handsome men use these products in sophisticated places happily. And also we can listen to fun commercial music which makes the images of these products better. Sometimes famous movie stars appear in the commercials and tell us how these products are great and useful. There TV commercials are broadcast on TV several times a day, and finally we remember the names of these products unconsciously. Advertising companies try to make commercials which impress good and strong images of these products to customers. In Japan, commercials with comedy touch are fashionable. In these advertisements , famous comedians say funny words to impress the product customers during the commercials Customers unconsciously remember the funny words.

In the advertisements for tobacco, we can see bad images of tobacco, but many smokers don't stop smoking in spite of these advertisements. My friends watch these advertisements for tobacco everyday, but keep smoking. The advertisements for medicine have a restriction, so a medicine company can't use an expression which tells more effects than it really are. But about other products besides tobacco and medicine, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the TV commercials, beautiful women and handsome men use these products in sophisticated places happily. And also we can listen to fun commercial music which makes the images of these products better. Sometimes famous movie stars appear in the commercials and tell us how these products are great and useful. There TV commercials are broadcast on TV several times a day, and finally we remember the names of these products unconsciously. Advertising companies try to make commercials which impress good and strong images of these products to customers. In Japan, commercials with comedy touch are fashionable. In these advertisements , famous comedians say funny words to impress the product customers during the commercials Customers unconsciously remember the funny words."", 'Children tell the funny word in their school and laugh with friends.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
897,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops. Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body. They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool. And so do their friends. Concluding my essay I would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even 'most' as is written in the statement. It would be unfair to declare advertisements to be generally false, dishonest or dangerous. There definitely are advertisements which state the truth about their product! Many adversitements even show a horrible content and can be really amusing.","[""With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops.

In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took. Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes.

Details are important for the students to understand anything that is not clear. Concepts and ideas should be understood by the students to know how it works. For example, If you understand your major by using the concepts and ideas of the major, you will understand how machines work because you understand the ideas of the machine.

Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts.

913,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As time goes by, older people get more experience from their lives and they already have some fierce. So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people. As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people worked for a living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of their lives. Young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is a very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself. Sometimes, he looks like a working robot. I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working has become his routine life. My father has worked hard for the living and he can't stop working even though he is rich enough.","[""I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

914,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Young people, like me, do not give enough time to helping their communities. i perfectly agree with this statement because i think that young people are always completely involved in their own life and in their passions. I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities.

915,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes for most people. When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strict schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone. As to me, my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it. Suppose, I plan to visit a historical place, which is relevant to my subject, and even most people do not know it, I may have to go there alone. On the contrary, if my destination is Yellow Stone park, I would like to join a group, so I can communicate with other members. In addition, money is another factor, which can affect my decision. On the one hand, if you have enough money, I prefer to go there alone because I have more flexibility. On the other hand, if the buffet is limited, I would like to share some costs with others, then I will choose a group to join.","['Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes for most people.

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are.

For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world. As one man, if you have agood advertisement about your product, you will have agood idea around the world. Beacuse T. V can show your advertisements to be good.

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who like sports.

Young people enjoy life more than older people, since young people are more healthy than old ones. As a matter of fact, young people are vivid ;that is to say ,they are full of life ;they, indeed ,can travel long distances enjoying the beauty of the land scape without any complaint. Nevertheless, old people cannot travel such distances and they easily get tired. In addition, young people can do other activities,such as going to the disco,swimming or hiking. Olders ,on the contrary, prefer sleeping or taking a nap rather than amusing themselves. Old people do not enjoy their life like young people because of age.","['Life is a gift from god and one has to enjoy it.

As a matter of fact, young people are vivid ;that is to say ,they are full of life ;they, indeed ,can travel long distances enjoying the beauty of the land scape without any complaint. Nevertheless, old people cannot travel such distances and they easily get tired. In addition, young people can do other activities,such as going to the disco,swimming or hiking. Olders ,on the contrary, prefer sleeping or taking a nap rather than amusing themselves.', 'Old people do not enjoy their life like young people because of age.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
931,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

932,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I strongly agree with the statement, as i personally experience the feeling. In life we need to enjoy every part, though it is related to money, adventure, drama etc. Elders are always frightened as they always think of the future rather than the present. But youngsters are really bothered about the future. For example when i am at school i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me, but finally they sent me with more caution. After comming back, they saw my video of my bangee jump on tour and started scolding me though i safely came back. They are always more curious in life and they never try for any adventure. I feel adventure is also part of enjoyment. Spending money is economy for elderly people but for young people money doesnt matter for enjoyment. when i started earning, i started spending for my own expenses, like restaurants, outings with friends, enjoying weekends, but my parents did nt like this as they wanted me to save money for my future. I feel that we need to enjoy it when we have the opportunity, as time never comes back. We can earn money through out our life. Youngsters like dressing in a modern way as per their comfort whereas elderly people feel that young people need to maintain their tradition but i feel dressing in modern does not mean that we are loosing our tradition.","['I strongly agree with the statement, as i personally experience the feeling.

935,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There is a big difference between the concept of having extra information about one academic topic in terms of having enough information and knowledge about more than one academic subject. According to me I prefer to have extra information about one topic instead of having knowledge about more than one topic. For some reasons such as ; being happy or earning more money. First of all; Having extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist in this area. it is such an important feature of making your job good. If you improve yourself really extraordinarily in a specific subject, it also brings you success and power. For instance; you are a doctor and you are really successful in your job. Everyone can know you because of your ability to achieve goals, as a result you will be a person who is unique in your area. Also this success could bring you happiness and money at the same time. You will be happy because you are doing your job well and people are admiring you for your high ability in this subject.

Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started.

938,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do. If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first. People need to try new things. Furthermore,in schools. Teachers ask questions of their students. Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question. Even if the solution that the student did is wrong,this is the best way of learning the right thing for students. Especially in Mathematics classes. Even though I was not sure about the solution,I always wanted to try to solve it and I was always the volunteer. Last but not least,the way which goes to succeed is not always clear,there are often difficulties. For example,someone wants to study abroad,brings everything in his back and goes to the country where he will study. In this situation,he takes a risk of losing all his relationships with friends and even with his family. Moreover,he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country. If he needs help,then there is nobody at the first times when he goes to this country.","['Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life.

There are millions of kinds of advertisements on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, or even mails. These various pictures and commits of the products seem much better than they really are.

For instance, BurgerKing will make advertisements to show how healthy their burgers or fried foods are; however, the fact is that any junk food is no good for your health. The advertisements for toys are the most popular one on the TV, since kids can not read yet and the carelessness parents always make their kids' requirements come true ; the companies of toys make millions of cartoon characters or games which are based on the cartoons every year.","['I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

941,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main character, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with. therefore, he becomes furious at not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide. This is a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when you are young.","['Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death.

944,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","It is difficult to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. First of all the car industry is strongly related to the petroleum industry, and they play such a strong role in the world's economy; i mean that there are too many interests of too many powerful people, so cars must be used to sell fuel whichmeans petroleum. It is true that worldwide transport communications have improved in recent years, Huge ""air traffic"" has taken place especially inthe 'nineties Furthermore, high speed trains have been created, even here in italy the government is about to create a high speed line. And there are also other modes of transport, for example ships, metros and busses. However in my opinion every man, every woman, prefers to move whenever they want and wherever they like without paying attention to reserving a ticket or arriving on time for the departure and whatever. And i am an example: I cannot imagine staying without my car, i need it for my job, i need it for my holidays and i can take it whenever i want without making a reservation and i am never late, i mean that my car is ""always waiting for me"". As we well know petroleum is going to the end, the reserves of these resources , called black gold, are almost to the end, i don't know who will be playing the economic rules the next 20 years, but let's thinkabout hydrogen. Cars working with hydrogen already exist, but it is too early to replace petroleum with hydrogen, for the reasons that i mentioned above. One thing is true: petrolemu will finish and so hydrogen working cars may will take place, and if not hydrogen, another alternative type of carburant, but it is in my opinion that cars will be much more than now.","['It is difficult to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly.

963,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible. It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius.","['Shaping of the human thinking style is possible.

964,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide. When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do. But any group in this situation would be disappointed. Finally, there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone, you are not alone. It means that going on a trip alone allows you to make friends. For instance, I went to Japan when I was a freshman at university. I had been travelling for a month. I could not speak Japanese fluently on that tour, I could make friends - Nakasaki, Murama, and Yorisimo. It was an unforgettable experience. When you are with your fellows, you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends. As I mentioned above, I don't like traveling in a group led by a. guide. Fixed tour planning makes me exhausted.

965,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it depends on the age of the student. For young students, like secondary and high school it will be more important to know about ideas and concepts. Students at this age are still at the beginning stage or we can say learning state. They will learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future. They may even learn from what is happening in history. By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results. This will be a worthwhile experience for students For example, they are two kinds of cost in production, fixed and variable cost. Fix cost should not be changed at any sum of productions. But when we increase or quantity any certain level, the fixed cost will change.","['I think it depends on the age of the student.

Nobody can get the facts without understanding the ideas and the concepts I believe that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of details and mistakes. Details are important for the students to understand anything that is not clear. Concepts and ideas should be understood by the students to know how it works. For example, If you understand your major by using the concepts and ideas of the major, you will understand how machines work because you understand the ideas of the machine. You will have more details about the machine. Students should understand ideas and concepts to learn the facts with more details. Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts. Less mistakes are important to have a great job to learn the facts because the facts mean that the lack of mistakes. for example, if the student understands ideas and concepts, they will have fewer mistakes than if they misunderstand them. If you have a device to improve, you should understand all the parts of this device to have fewer mistakes. If you do not understand the ideas and concepts, you can not improve this device.

Details are important for the students to understand anything that is not clear. Concepts and ideas should be understood by the students to know how it works. For example, If you understand your major by using the concepts and ideas of the major, you will understand how machines work because you understand the ideas of the machine. You will have more details about the machine. Students should understand ideas and concepts to learn the facts with more details. Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts. Less mistakes are important to have a great job to learn the facts because the facts mean that the lack of mistakes. for example, if the student understands ideas and concepts, they will have fewer mistakes than if they misunderstand them. If you have a device to improve, you should understand all the parts of this device to have fewer mistakes.

977,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons. First, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. For example, in 1995 when I was junior at Tokyo University in Tokyo Japan, I studied law and tax. One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law. One of my friends, Tanaka, is the best student studying economics and has a lot of knowledge of the bank system. He helped me. I was able to learn a lot of things about bank law. As the example shows, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. Second, having a variety of academic subjects is more fun. For example, in 1996 when I worked part-time at a private school, I taught Japanese History. I taught Japanese History ,Law and Tax in the historical class. Children in my class were interested in social systems. They asked me a lot of questions about history, law and tax. Some children wanted to study law. I had a good time at my lecture. This experience clearly shows that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes me fun and brings me a good time.","['I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons.

994,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","First of all, let me ask you this question. Would you like more cars or not? Aren't you aware of the severe air pollution problem? Don't you get embarrassed when passing at a speed of 10km/h in crowded crowded area? In twenty years, fewer cars will be in use than now. Actually, i used to dream of these kinds of cases when I was involved in environmental friendly social services.

By that time, I sometimes had that feeling one day, cars should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly. Likewise, the place i'm living now Singapore is a very country which has succeeded in reducing the number of cars. The high taxes included in the purchase disgust the buyers' taste for getting a new car. Not only the tax included in the buying process but taxes such as ERP, those which are paid when cars are passing the city area, are having great success in making people use fewer cars. This morning, i read in the internet newspaper about a very special item; the Flying Car M-400. This car has been put on Ebay as an 'on sale' item and the price predicted was about 4000 millions US $. It also included that this kind of car will perhaps be more popular in about 20 years, and in the time 20 years pass, I think scientists and engineers will be able to find a new kind of sources as a replacement for fuel.

Young people are inexperienced,so they can try everything that they feel exciting. They may climb trees and hills, travel across rivers and oceans to experience the glory of nature. They may easily take bills that take all the money, because they got an idea to try a new thing,and then they think it's worthwhile. Young people are confident,they will do every thing that they want to do. They may just have a little company with a little money,and then try their best to make it gloomy. They may also get crazy in their dreams,to be a painter,dancer,engineer or many other careers. Young people are never too young,if they want ,they can do anything. No matter how others are considering their behaviors and how astonishing their behaviors are,once decided to do that,they will never stop. Young people are free,they have not too much to think of. They do not have to worry about how much money they still have,or how they get rid of the next poor days,or climbing in the rain may cause illness instead of appreciating the great natural. So i think young people enjoy life better than older people.

996,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yong people enjoy life more than older people do. I agree with this statement. Nowadays young people enjoy themselves well compared to in the old days. Because at this present time they have so many entertaining equipments and these all are not available in the olden days. And the world is developing rapidly. At a time, young people also worked hard to achieve their goals and to realise their ambitions. They are doing hardwork and enjoy it at a time. They separate their time for working and for enjoying themselves. Now these days so many young people are working for many great companies and corporate companies,then they all work weekly for five days for company and the remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family. So young people also do hardwork but they make some schedule and follow that. Now so many young people are working for some company or worked for some institute,But these companies and institutes are built by old people. So old people work in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run those institutes and companies. From the above two sentences i can say that old people work harder than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels. And these days also have some young managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists,But they all get that companies and that industry from their parents and they run those companies verywell. Suppose Anil Abani is a great industrialist and great managing director for Reliance companies. But he gets them from his father and he also works hard and develops their companies and develops their shares in the present market.

I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies. Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as the Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of the computer all day and play games.

Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topic allows students to go through the investing process. For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literature and find out for themselves that certain techniques add to the perfection of writing.

Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it.

1007,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination.

1009,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture.","['I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts. Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts. Any student who is getting older can learn from his past about the facts. For example consider a 10th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world. So it is better for him to concentrate on his studies then to know about the facts. Third is it's the time for students to improve their skills in their studies because if they improve their skills in it then they automatically learn about the facts in it.

It is important, that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding, but mainly these dates and names can be researched in a book, or on the internet at almost any time.

Concepts are more likely to be necessary in daily life, than are facts. What I mean is, if there were two or more countries combating each other, it would be war. From school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times, that in all wars many people were killed, and in most of those lands and people changed nationality once the war was over.

In our society, most students attend schools and learn many things such as Maths, Science, and English. Based on what students learn from the schools is a fact, but they must understand the concepts and ideas of the lessons first. Understanding ideas and concepts requires more importance than the facts. Once they complete to comprehend the ideas and concepts, the way they study is easier and faster. For example, in a biology class, there are students who are used to analyzing ideas and concepts first than the facts and the students who value the facts more than the ideas and concepts. The student(fact) will be struggling with memorizing all the functions of the human body and will spend plenty of time finishingit. However, as mentioned above, once the student understands how each function of the human body works, it is easy to memorize. Moreover, the study may be fun and enjoyable. Learning the facts will take less time than understanding the ideas and concepts because people just memorize the facts without understanding ideas and concepts.","['It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts.

1026,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work. Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them. In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures. A person has to love his work to create new things and to succeed indeed. By taking risks you learn new useful things that help you in your life. My brother was in a running race and he not only won but also created a new personal best. He was very happy to take risks and score a new number. Last but not least, trying new things helps you to get more experience and self-confidence. By doing these new things you will be prodded and everybody will love you. In conclusion, i will be a dentist and i will create new things for my world because that's real success. I hate to do my regular work without trying to do new things.","[""People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work.

1027,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like. Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound.","[""I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things.

They can find the location they want to see simply. However, old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators. Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people. Thus, they do simpler trips while young people travel to diverse places. Old people are not likely to fertilize new machines to enhance their life. Young people usually have more passion than old people whatever they do. I think people need passion to enjoy their life. They have to try to find out how they can have fun where they can hang out for fun. They have to plan some activities. To do all this preparation for doing something to enjoy, great passion is required, However, old people usually do not have passion for whatever they do because they are socially and mentally weak.","['I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play.

1039,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Many countries are developing rapidly now. Just like China and India. These two countries were not so superior in ecnormics before, but they are developing now. there is a big population in both of the two countries. As the country developed, they would be manufactured a large number of cars for transport or for the citizens' use. As we all know,China is the biggest bike using country in the world. But now,more and more Chinese people have started to buy cars instead of bikes. Of course so do the people in India. People need cars when they want to go to a place not so near to them.

Many countries are developing rapidly now. Just like China and India. These two countries were not so superior in ecnormics before, but they are developing now. there is a big population in both of the two countries. As the country developed, they would be manufactured a large number of cars for transport or for the citizens' use. As we all know,China is the biggest bike using country in the world.

1040,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that It is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts as well as to learn facts. They both compliment each other. It is crucial for students to understand ideas, as well as concepts. If students don't understand the concepts , they won't learn them. When students know the concepts because they understood them, they won't forget them. By understanding the ideas and concepts, the students have the capacity and the ability to explain to others what they know and the area that they dominate. Also, students that understand topics, have more chances of getting good grades in tests, because they can give more facts and an example of what they understood in class. That is why it is so important for teachers to explain with examples and to give facts and make good points, so that the students can understand the area that they are studying completely. Teachers should ask questions to see if all the class comprehended the point that they were trying to emphasise. When students understand the ideas and concepts they will have better results in their exams as well as presentation, reports and other evaluations. Also they will have the capacity to help others that don't understand the area. For students is also important to learn facts because before they understand the concepts and ideas they have to learn the facts of the subject. By learning the facts they learn the reasons why something happened, where something happened, why something happened and who made it happen. Facts are also really important, and teachers teach the facts so that the students learn them and understand them. Learning the facts makes students know everything about a topic or a subject.","[""I agree that It is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts as well as to learn facts.

I still remember many toys and devices i bought when i was young, actually i forced my parents to buy them, because they were really amazing on the screen, but i was really shocked, because they were different from what i've seen in the advertisement. Why do they do that? I think because of the strong competition with the other companies, they have no choice. They must make their product look perfect as much as they can, otherwise, no one will buy it, especially with the kids stuff. The child doesn't have the ability to analyse the advertisement and figure out if it's real or not, unlike the mature.

Maybe it will not be easy but it cold helps us to grow up as a person and can help us to have an exit. People who do not want to have an exit in their lives always do the same thing all their lives. That would be really boring and sad. As human beings we have to have something to encourage us to be a better person. That something could be trying new things. Doing new things means we can open the door to reach the exit in our lives which is what everybody wants; also can develop the different skills that we have and we can realize our value as human beings. To have an exit in our lives can help us to find the happiness that we have been looking for all our entired lives and can help us to share that happiness with the people that we love, and can also encourage others to follow and reach their dreams and to be successful people.', 'The common idea that we have as human beings of a successful person may not be the correct one, most people think that a person who has an exit in his or her life has to be bad or corrupt but, no, everybody in this life can have an exit if we want, the only thing that we have to do is take risks and try new things in our lives and of course we have to have the desire to do it.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
1055,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. That is because young people are busy with their business time and in their private time. Let me explain why young people are busy in those two times. In business time,young people are apt to have a lot of tasks compared to a business person in 20 years ago. In this two decades,most companies in the world have been decreasing redundant costs. So a lot of workers are dismissed. Consequently business people who can avoid lay offs have a lot of tasks which dismissed workers have. In my case,I work at a famous bank in Japan which is Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. I always work from 9 am to 22 pm because of having many tasks. Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi made a lay off last year. 2000 workers were dismissed. In my department which is composed of 8 bankers,two old bankers were dismissed. So the tasks for 6 bankers increased. Therefore I do not have enough time to help my communities on weekdays. In private time,young people are also busy. Young people have a lot of media,for instance mobile phones and the internet, compared to a person in 20 years ago. So young people are apt to spend a lot of time using those medicines. From my experience,my mobile phone rings 20 times a day.","['I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

This result could be reached thanks to a breakdown in the use of cars, which pollute a lot because of exhaust gases. However, I do not think that in twenty years the use of cars will be less important because cars bring us the comfort that no other way to travel can equalize. First of all, cars are very comfortable. Thanks to them, we can go quite fast wherever we like. Nowadays, in every country in the world there are concrete roads which enable us to travel by car. This is a common point of all Earth citizens. Moreover, it is a private place. It belongs to you as your flat or house does. Consequently, you can adapt it to your tastes and make it look as you want. For instance, we can often see cars painted with funny colours or with a lot of sticks on the windows. You can also decide whether to clean it or not, whether to allow pets to get in, whether to listen to music loudly or not. On the contrary it is impossible to act this way on public transport like buses. You have to bear people attitude even if you disagree with it. Finally, I reckon that only environmental concerns can prevent people from using their cars which would have been replaced by eco-friendly buses for example. However developing countries can not afford and implement such progress. So, inhabitants of developed countries won`t agree to give up their cars' comfort while people in developed countries still take advantage of it.","['The environmental concerns we know nowadays such as the melting of the ice cap or the thickness of the ozone layer make us wish that there would be less pollution in the future.

The first one is that he will earn profit for himself which is a positive aspect of the risk taken. But on the other hand there is equal probability of his failure which is a negative aspect. In my opinion,both of them can't be stated as success. Because real success is to learn from failure and then hit your target again,but this time with full preparation and timing.

There are several reasons, they spend too much time on their jobs, they are not familiar with the people in their communities and unwilling to try to get to know them, and they prefer to spend their own time on other pleasures. In the technology generation, people spend more time on their jobs because they arecompetitive. They have to work very hard to keep their jobs. They have to spend a lot of time to achieve the achievements. They have to work as long as possible to show their loyalty to their boss. That causes the average time in office increased and there is no time left for the communities. Besides, modern society is becoming more conservative than before because of the increasing crimes. People don't say hello to strangers. They treat the strangers with a suspicious manner. That makes people unwilling to get involved in community services.

1085,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I totally disagree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I disagree with this because I am a young person who spends enough time helping my community. Why am I so sure that young people give enough time to helping their communities? First, I would like to say that at my university, there are numerous clubs dedicated to devoting. I am one of these clubs' members. We go to some retirement associations to chat with old people. Some of them have children, but their children are too busy to go to meet them. So we go there to accompany them and to clean the environment. Sometimes we go to meet children who lost their parents. Most of them are still very young, but do have enough love from family. So we become their brothers or sisters. We go there to teach and give them love. Moreover, all students at my university must help the community. This is the course we must take, if we do not serve, we will not graduate. Although some students are reluctant to do this, after they help the community, all of them are happy and willing to do the service by volunteering. Finally, I do not disagree that some people say we do not give enough time to helping.","[""I totally disagree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Furthermore, we would choose our major from what we learned in school and studying broad subjects across the range for us to choose. What I have found now is that which major I should choose. Though I have already studied some subjects, I still do not figure out which major suits me best. This is an important aspect because I should use the knowledge about my major after graduation and I would earn money by working in this field. If I choose the wrong major because of lacking interests and being unable to study, I could not revive myself in the future. Broad knowledge makes me comfortable choosing the one I like best and studying my major well. To sum up,though one specific subject is a skill for certain people to use like painting , I still draw the conclusion that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject.', 'Time to sleep, bye.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
1103,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I totally disagree with the statement, 'Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities'. WE ARE, if the word community determines not a division on the basis of ' race, colour or creed'. The new generation of young people are more social conscious than those in the past. They broke open many barriers that older generations of same age group lived in. The new ads on the TV would speak to the extent of support even from their parents do young people receive for participating in helping their communities. In this case, the ad begins showing a distressed young man sitting on a balcony watching the streets he lives in. He is shocked to see the state of living he is in, with roads filled with litter, nothing in place. He then gets shocked to see a little boy searching for food near a bin. This little boy awakens to the plight of situations that can be altered. He invites his friends not for an outing like any other weekend, but to clean up the streets, not waiting for help from the government. They also help the little boy with some food, and they raise donations to help the boy with education. Parents are shown not restricting the movements of the boys. That could just be an ad, but it depicts the state of mind the new generation has. We are capable of bads, but if molded, we can make the best out of the worst.

Or young people tend not to have any interests in others. Most elderly people say ""a long time ago young people had sufficient time for helping their communities. ""However, time is always changing, therefore, young people do not want to help or not like their communities at all. Even if their parents may not care about those communities, so they might not push their sons or daughters to go to communities. On the other hand, because Japanese people are studying so harder than playing, and some young people have to focus on studying instead of helping the communities, they do not have time to go to communities. Not only Japanese people study so hard, but also do Asian people study very hard if we compare between Asia and North America. Americans may have enough time to help their communities because I saw young Americans using my eyes. Also, I heard from my friends who are Americans that Japanese people are studying harder than Americans. It means that Japanese people do not have time to help their communities.

1120,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. This is like this. A lot of younger people are very enthusiastic about their young life to explore new things so as to enjoy the maximum extent as the older people who have experienced almost all the things in their life tend to relax in their older ages. Now, young people who are new to the world with new intentions like to spend their time enjoying life as much as possible like doing many things, such as going to the theaters to watch films and pubs every weekend to have fun, can play a lot of games together and even participate in high level tournaments, can have sex, can enjoy their university life as a student and many other things. Many of these things can also be enjoyed by older people but they are bored with doing them as they did a lot in their young life. Playing sports requires a lot of strength and energy which older people lack. Having a lot of parties with friends in young life is another important thing to be considered which older people may find difficult to do as often as young people do and they also think that they are a waste of money. To some extent even older people who are still interested will enjoy attending the parties and pubs. One more important thing is the student life, which will not be repeated again. Students enjoy themselves a lot in universities in many respects such as sports, research and even in some other co-curricular activities. Older people can definitely not do that again, but can enjoy it as a professor which is quite different from student life.","['I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

But, fundamentally, I agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. My primary reason is that using a tour guide is safer than not using one. In particular, people who participate in the group travel have less experience of going abroad. They completely lack knowledge about this foreign country. A tour guide has a lot of experience and a lot of information about it. For example, in Asia, there are many dangerous areas which almost all residents keep away from. If you are taught by a tourist about this information, you will not face the dangerous situation. However, it is true that there are poor guides. Preventing you from hiring a bad tourist, you should choose a big company which provides good service. The second reason is that the tour guide can lead you to a good place where you can not be detected by yourself. In particular, on a short trip, you should go around some country in a hurry, and you do not have enough time to spare. In this point of view, the existence of a tour guide can reduce the waste of time. In addition, he can provide a lot of information which makes your trip more exciting. If you do not hire a tour guide , you will regret it. Most people seldom go on a trip, at most, once in a year.","['Some people might say that using a tour guide is a waste of money.

1124,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I kind of disagree with this statement. I agree that understanding ideas and concepts are important, but learning facts is also important. By understanding ideas and concepts students learn how facts take place. It is not just once you understand ideas, you do need to worry about how facts happen. For example, my professor explained the process of the earthquake. She briefly described each and every detail about it. Now i know how an earthquack happens, but what if i do not know the facts of it. How can i prove my concept of the earth quack, if i do not have a specific example. If i said that there are earthquack happen in indonesia, and explain these are the reasons this happens over there more often, then i support my statement. My facts support my concept and ideas. The  happening of the earthquake in indonesia is a fact. I need to know it to understand my concept better. Facts are important in order to understand the concept. You can not say that fact does not worth it. Without fact no concept and no idea take place. Facts are the life of concepts. One more example here is that countries in the southern hemisphere have a warmer climate and countries in the northern hemisphere have a cooler climate. How can i prove this statement? I will give all my geographical reasons and explanation. How can I prove all my geographical reasons? Now to have facts is important. If i say that the United States is in the Northern Hemisphere and that is why it has a cloudy climate, and Sri Lanka is in the Southern Hemisphere and that is why it has a warm climate.","['I kind of disagree with this statement.

1131,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think both points are equally important in college but in your later life it would be more important to understand the arguments and basics than to learn the facts off by hard work. Nobody can understand a theme just by learning simple facts, it is the complex idea that makes someone understand. Everybody can learn things off by hard, but not everyone understands the material. And the understanding for me makes a person grow not only its mind but also its personality. But still there are some benefits to both sides. When I had history classes in school for instance, I was always really good at understanding the ideas and concepts that were discussed, but always when I had to write an exam I had problems remembering important dates. And that is what the main point of history is, isn't it? The result was that I never got a better mark than a three. That is just the average mark in Germany. But when I started to study the dates which resemble the facts in the question. I suddenly got much better marks. On the other hand if I had just known the dates I would have gotten a much worse mark, because I probably wouldn't have understood any of the assignments. But I also think that there are cases where you just have to know simple facts. In some parts of biology, chemistry, physics and maths, in all science. I mean if you have to label body parts of an animal or human, there is no way in doing that without knowing the facts.

1132,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts. The reason is that understanding ideas and concepts is more creative activity for students. When we try to understand the ideas and concepts, we must consider lots of factors of ideas and concepts. First we must confirm whose ideas or concepts they are, to add more information to them as the backgrounds. Next, we make an analysis of why they have the ideas or the concepts using acquired background information. After these practices, we can approach the stage to make answers or own opinions. To get answers or opinions, students can have a discussion with friends, parents, and brothers. In addition, they can get some suggestions from their teachers or they can also conduct investigations using books or the internet to add more information. I think that these consequent practices are very important for students to develop their way of thinking. In contrast, learning facts does not need such pressures. It is easy to access the facts without any kind of thinking. To learn facts, students just sit down on their seats in the class room and just listen to what their teacher says. In this case, the information is only given from their teacher to students. If students listen to what their teacher says and write it down in their notebook, they can get new knowledge.","['I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts.

Some people like to travel alone and some do not, they like to travel in a group. A tour guide is one of the strategies that travelers always experience. Traveling in a group has many advantages. First it allows a person to share the ideas which are provided by the other travels and sometimes the person will learn from his group. Second a group can help each other in bad situations as the saying goes "" A friend in need is a friend indeed"". Moreover the person can have such a nice time with them especially when they are friends. For the last two years, I have been to the United kingdom regularly, in London. I had a great time there, but I believe that I would have a greater time if I went with a tour guide. I did not visit everything there because I didn't know where I should go. However, my cousin visits all the museums and the malls there and all of that refers to the tour guide. Tour guides are beneficial for tourists because they help them not to know what places they should visit.","['Traveling is a very important aspect in our life.

Therefore, young people have more choices to relax right now and in the future. Also, most considered ""young"" people are still in the process of learning.

1144,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Many people are afraid when they try something new. On the other hand, some people enjoy the afraid feeling and the risks. Many times, some people, who try something not familiar, could be successful, fortunately. In my opinion, trying new things is effective and essential to make one's life and others' lives successful. The first reason why I think trying something new is right is that it needs to be brave. Even though there are a lot of damage and risks as you try a new thing, the difficulties probably can give chances to your life. Bravery is one of the most important factors in order to not only be successful but also live with confidence. In that, trying something new means the person is very brave, which needs to be self-esteem oneself. I believe someone, who loves himself , can enjoy his or her life. In addition, trying something new gives more opportunities. If you do what you already know how to do well, you will probably not fail. However, you cannot succeed as much as you want, because the ordinary thing is for everyone. The new things are the only way to get more opportunities. For example, Bill Gates is the richest person in the world. However, at first, his company was not that wealthy to make him the wealthiest person on Earth, because the ""computer business"" was not famous, then. Fortunately, Gates challenges into the new field, and he achieves his goals and helps other humans to enjoy computers. Finally, trying new things makes the world improve. When people who try new things achieve success, it means the world becomes more comfortable.","['Many people are afraid when they try something new.

1152,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"As far as I am concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. A student, in general, even if he has the idea of what to do in his working future, does not always match his dreams with the real life. It can happen that the economic situation at the beginning of his studies could be very different from the one at the end of his studies. This can happen for several reasons, such as political, economic, and so on. If a student starts to concentrate only on a specific subject, that can be for example, literature , at the end of his studies I will be very well educated on that subject, but in a world that is requiring people that have technological skills. It is important to say that a student that is involved in many academic subjects will be able to manage all of it, but he will always have the possibility to specialize in one of them. I want to say that the best choice to make is to study many academic subjects because it is always possible to specialize in one specific subject during the study period. On the other hand it is always more difficult to change its own study plan from a specific subject to many academic subjects. Only if a student has the chance to study different academic subjects can he also have the opportunity to discover his talent in subjects that he did not know that he was able to do. Sometimes talent is hidden and only a good teacher can help students to reveal it. Students, if they decide to study only a specific academic subject, will not give the chance to any professor to discover their talent. The Italian University educational approach is based on many academic subjects that can give students the opportunity to learn different topics and also not linked from each one. Only after university , can they choose to specialize in one specific subject. I can see that Italian students, in the end, are more prepared than USA students, these latter are too specialized in only one subject and unable to face real life so different and changeable.","['As far as I am concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

1154,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons. First, young people are less interested in the activities of their communities, although communities are indispensable for people to live in. For example, I participate in a clean up activity around the central station of my city. This activity is held every week and young people who live in my city are strongly encouraged to attend, however, there are few young people among the participants. This example clearly shows that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Second, the vote rate of young people in elections in Japan is generally much less than that of elderly people, although joining the political process of communities is an important activity to keep their communities active and healthy. To join the political process, the voter must have their opinion about their communities. If young people participate in their communities, they should have some opinion about the situation or future of their communities, and they should have a strong incentive to go voting. This is the reason why I think young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Third, there are many companies which help elderly people with their house hold errands and chores. The companies run their customers' errands instead of instead of elderly people.","['I agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons.

To answer this question is important to take two points of view, the first one is to answer why young people enjoy life, and then answer why old people enjoy life, and finally i will see who enjoy life more, young people or older people.

By the other hand, i think that older people also enjoy life, because no matter the age that you have you will always learn , and at this point in your life you have more experience, so you dont have to worry about if you are going to make a mistake, because you know that if you make it everything will be ok.

1164,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Depending on the circumstances to which the question could be posed, the answers vary accordingly. Of course, young adults have completely different sources of enjoyment to middle aged people who in turn, have different enjoyment to a pensioner.

A younger crowd will enjoy attending parties, attending night clubs, doing rather challenging and more physically tiring sports. A middle aged person might enjoy playing a game of chess or maybe going to the opera and for that middle aged person, attending noisy parties and doing dangerous sports might not be enjoyment at all. Therefore, depending on the age that you have, whatever you do will bring upon it the correct benefit. There is a typically trend that young people believe that they enjoy life more than an older person because they believe that the younger you are the more fun you can have, this i believe is incorrect because, yes of course, the younger you are the more options of enjoyment you might think you mighthave. For example, a father of a child would rather spend time with his son or daughter rather than attend a gathering full of 20-year-olds just because he has different priorities. A young person would not enjoy spending time with relatives or older members of his family simply because at that age, you tend to have different obligations, different points of interest and a different type of mentality. Younge rpeople tend to feel that as your age you miss out on what is really fun, but we must remember that older people were young at one point and what a young person thinks a older person will never dream of doing, might just probably mean that it was already done.","['Depending on the circumstances to which the question could be posed, the answers vary accordingly.

A young person would not enjoy spending time with relatives or older members of his family simply because at that age, you tend to have different obligations, different points of interest and a different type of mentality.', 'Younge rpeople tend to feel that as your age you miss out on what is really fun, but we must remember that older people were young at one point and what a young person thinks a older person will never dream of doing, might just probably mean that it was already done.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
1165,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I disagree with the statement, because for me it is always necessary to take some risks and try new things to have success and not only when you know how to do well. In fact for me, if you don't try one thing, you don't try another thing because you don't have the experience that the precedent thing can giveyou. For example, if you don't try to use a bicycle, you don't learn to go with it, and after you don't learn to use a scooter, it is more difficult than using a bicycle. But if you learn to go over a bicycle, after you can also use a scooter ; so you can use both of them. The Experiences that you try to do, help you to endure your life. This is the main reason why i say that it is important to take risks and try new things and new adventures. And for me also the worst experiences are important because they also help you not to commit the same errors another time. In fact, for example, if you drive a lot before school, and after you have had an accident, you learn that you don't drink any alcohol before you drive for the next time.","[""I disagree with the statement, because for me it is always necessary to take some risks and try new things to have success and not only when you know how to do well.

1166,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities or not. some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their communities. However, I firmly believe that helping their communities is quite an important thing in their life. First of all, We can not live by ourselves. we have to help each other. of course that is an option and we can choose whatever we want, but nowadays, It would be harder and harder if people tried to live bythemselves. If we try to spend our time in communities, It can be a good way to get to know many people who can help us when we get into a hard time. For example, I was trying to have my own piano recitle in my communites. and I heard that is not so easy. but fortunately I was a volunteer in my community last summer and through that experience, I had a chance to get to know lots of people who could help me. so I could have a report very easily because of their recommendations. Secondly, we can improve our social skills. nowadays, people tend to be isolated. but I dont think that is the best way to live.

For example if a young man wants to go for a tour in his holidays then the first thing that comes to his mind is where to go, whom to take, when etc but when an old person considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that comes to his mind is how long the journey will be and what all precautions he needs to take. young people can freely do whatever they want but older people may have many health problems which will restrict them from doing things which they would have liked to do. Young people can eat ,drink and do anything they like but older people will have many restrictions. When it comes to sports young people are encouraged to play many of them, whereas older people are always cautioned and even they are afraid to play to their full potential. Older people's mindsets are mainly different when compared to younger people like they look at life as a journey coming to an end mostly thinking about what they have achieved and feeling satisfied, whereas young people never think of their past they always plan their future, they view their life as a beginning of a great journey. For example older people think about their college days when they were young always thinking of funny things and their personal experiences and feeling satisfied.","[""I agree with the statement.

There are also some sports because of the age problem, they could not enjoy them. and we often see some instruction in the playground. some really good games are age restricted. Second, young people's minds are older than the old ones. they are easier to accept and learn new things. for instance, the internet. young people can use email or some on linetool to communicate with each other like msn or skype, but older people could not. for example, my mother can just simply look on the internet. it is not that easy to send email or chat on the Internet, that is because the speed of typing is very slow. for my grandmother it is a problem even though she wants to surf the internet. Computer games have so much fun, but they can not enjoy them. so young people enjoy life more than older people do. Finally, young people have good boys to enjoy life. the older people are often trapped by the health problems. when they become older. they often get some serious illnesses.","[""I agree with the title statement.

1177,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I would like to answer this question by introducing what that means: enjoy life. Whether people enjoy their lives or not depends on many things. Firstly, it could depend on your hobbies, like playing basketball or fishing. Both are completely different and you might say that fishing is more suitable for older people whereas basketball is more suitable for younger people. Secondly, it depends on your social circumstances. This means some people enjoy spending time with their family. Others like to go to parties whenever possible. This can also be related to age. Additionally it could depend on the education. Higher educated people maybe would like to visit an opera rather than hanging around in a bar. Today a lot of people think education was much better in former times. Nevertheless I believe younger people enjoy life more for several reasons (but this answer is somehow biased, because I think I am young). All the reasons mentioned above cannot lead to an adequate answer from my point of view, because those are personal things. Younger people enjoy life more, because they have less responsibilities. So younger people have more space to be spontaneous than older people have. Furthermore younger people are on average healthier, which gives them the possibility of doing more things in a shorter period of time. In addition there is a lot of stuff to discover, which older people may have discovered already. The advantage of older people is that they usually have more money for enjoying life, but I believe that is caused by today's globalization it is less important. Everything becomes cheaper and money is not required for enjoying life.","[""I would like to answer this question by introducing what that means: enjoy life.

It 's not a lot of time for us to help our communities. Financially, communities were the people who lived there, not only young people should care.

Firstly, young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like. For example, young people play with their friends and they also know about where to play and which was the best time or place. They care about their communities, if there is no play give them play. They not only make friends, but can also help communities. Secondly, helping communities is a rule that every day and every minute should follow. For instance, everyday we go to school, we might see what happens in our communities. or what interests you? If in communities who need our help, we can call the neighborhood to help them. It 's not a lot of time for us to help our communities. Financially, communities were the people who lived there, not only young people should care. For example, old people , young people and children are all living in these communities."", 'If Some one needs help, not only young people can help this person, old people can also help them with this time.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
1181,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The statement, 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is telling us that, to succeed, you have to try new things and take risks rather than always doing the way you are really good at. I agree with the statement. I think it helps to make something you are not really good at and make it one of the things you are good at. It also makes you experience many things and experiences success, and sometimes fail. That teaches us what is right and what is wrong. In your life, you have to try many things. When you are a baby, you have to try to get up and walk. If you don't start with that kind of risk, you will never walk, and not be like a normal person. Taking risks might be something very difficult. It might also be very easy. When you try something, you can like it, or you can hate it. It's all your choice. for example, this term, it tried for all the sports teams in school. I thought I was really bad at basketball, but when I joined the team, I figured out that I really liked it, and was actually better than what I thought. Making my self made me have a new hubby and try to be better at it. Trying and taking risks helps you to learn what is right and what is wrong. When you try, you sometimes succeed, and sometimes fail. My dad told me that failing makes you succeed more and helps you learn what to do next to not failing at the same thing. For example, my brother really liked tennis even though he didn't do it. When he tried, he found out that he didn't like it at all. From then, he didn't do tennis, and found out that one of his hobbies wasn't really his hobby. In that case, he failed and also succeeded in what he tried. He failed at guessing what his hobby was, but he succeeded in finding out what his real hobby was. I think successful people always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. It helps people to try and be good at something you tried. It also makes you learn what is right and what is wrong and makes you not make the mistake you did again when you do it again.","['The statement, \'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is telling us that, to succeed, you have to try new things and take risks rather than always doing the way you are really good at.

1183,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Are there differences in enjoyment in life compared with young people and those of whom are older at age? Well, I think that is a question that depends on the personality or different backgrounds in which the person came from. However, I do think that a younger person will have the advantage of enjoying and having fun in life because they have less to worry about. When a person becomes older they are more aware and warned of personal and social problems, at school, friendships , grades and so on. What I thought was the most difficult, while growing up to be a pre-teenager was that I had to conform with others and I had to use the right choice of words. When you are little you have limited thoughts of how your words may affect others and how you accept differences, but when you grow up, you may be discriminated against and discriminated against because of your skin color and the clothes you wear, or the way you look.","['Are there differences in enjoyment in life compared with young people and those of whom are older at age?

While the first reaction of some people may disagree with this statement, there are some compelling reasons to explore this issue in more depth. Concerning the status quo of today's society, I personally agree with this statement for the following two reasons. First, the atmosphere of competition is getting stronger in many fields, such as career or study. People treat educational degrees with more seriousness, and consequently, people are required to pursue higher degrees than in previous times. Nowadays, parents are aware of this change in society. As a result, they expect their children to pay exclusive attention to their studies, or specifically, to everything which is helpful to their education. Helping the communities simply turns into a waste-of-time behavior if it is not beneficial to the studies. In addition, the security problems also reduce people's willingness to help the communities. There are more crimes or robbery acts happening in the dark corner of the street all the time. Parents are worried about the children's safety, and as a consequence fewer and fewer parents or adults will encourage their children to hang out outside as long as the neighbourhood is alive with a signal of unsafty. there is one true example that happened to my mom. Last year she just walked home after work, she unfortunately robbed by a young man. Her bags were gone as well as some amount of money. My mother was terrifying, and she started warning me that I had to come home no later then six o'clockon any circumstances , and tried my best not to hang around the community because it was very dangerous.","[""A number of people have argued that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities.

That is, in other words, age can sometimes be a hindrance towards living life to its fullest, and of course enjoying it to very far extents and dimensions. Nevertheless, i personally do not support and agree with this statement simply because the modern society lifestyle is not tied to age, old people do have more experience in life than younger people, and the spirit never gets old even though the body does. As a matter of fact, modern societies and modern lifestyles do not impose any age considerations as far as their activities are concerned. That is to say, old people can always do what is done by young people without being under the spotlight and focus, and no one finds it strange and odd when he finds them doing such activities. As an example, an old person can go and have a concert with his girl friend or wife till down without being someone exceptional. So, our open society leaves all doors open in the face of all people, whatever their age is. Secondly, I do think that old people ` s experiences in life do back them up in enjoying their life to its fullest in the sense that it allows them to have a good knowledge of how life can be lived and enjoyed more than young people. The difference between young and old people would be quite obvious if a comparison of how both parts enjoy their holidays is to be made.

1194,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Some people claim that successful people only work hard, while others like me fully agree that success depends on trying and searching. The first point i would like to make is that there are strong advantages to working in the same way. One benefit of working in the same way is not becoming any risks. You won`t fall down. For instance, my father who is a mechanical mechanical engineer. He worked 30 years for one company so he had enough money and promotions. He started as a basic engineer and he became his promotions with his hard work. He didn ` t have any stress because the company doesn`t care about him he cares only abouthis work. Undoubtedly, not taking risks means a healthy, relaxed and safe life. Though there are strong advantages to working in the same way there are some even more compelling advantages for me to work with risks. When you take risks the income will be more. For example, I`m a mechanical engineer like my father but i want to have my own company so i can take more risks to make my company bigger. These risks will be enjoyable too because i like this lifestyle. More than that, i can learn a lot of things with my risks. The income will always be bigger with risks. In addition, without risks a person couldn`t be creative enough. With the help of stress our body has got more adrenalin which means more creativity and better work.","['Some people claim that successful people only work hard, while others like me fully agree that success depends on trying and searching.

He started as a basic engineer and he became his promotions with his hard work. He didn ` t have any stress because the company doesn`t care about him he cares only abouthis work. Undoubtedly, not taking risks means a healthy, relaxed and safe life. Though there are strong advantages to working in the same way there are some even more compelling advantages for me to work with risks. When you take risks the income will be more. For example, I`m a mechanical engineer like my father but i want to have my own company so i can take more risks to make my company bigger. These risks will be enjoyable too because i like this lifestyle. More than that, i can learn a lot of things with my risks. The income will always be bigger with risks. In addition, without risks a person couldn`t be creative enough.', 'With the help of stress our body has got more adrenalin which means more creativity and better work.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

1200,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"There have been a lot of events from the past in Korea : the Korean war, the invasion from Japan, many political incidents, and so on. That's why the older generation has gone through roughly in Korea. However, the young generation has no problem living within our country these days without thinking of many problems the older generation has had. There are some evidences that show why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. On a trip field, it is kind of boom for many young people in Korea to go to Europe for their travel recently. Not only Europe, but also many countries, such as the States, the U. K. , southern Asia, Latin America. The most important thing is that they go travelling with their money which is from their part-time job or their work. Whereas, there is no doubt that older people didn't usually go travelling abroad when they were younger. It's because they couldn't afford travelling abroad at that time, which doesn't mean that they didn't want to. Besides, development for flying abroad was not enough for them at that time. In other words, there were a few barriers for older people to travel abroad. As to the work as it concerned, while older people had to work 6 days a week from 9 a. m. to 8 p. m. , even more, the younger generation has ""working for 5 days a week from 9 to 5"" these days. They can even take a rest on Friday for some jobs. That's the reason why they can enjoy life on the weekends. They go shopping, go to a concert, go to a theatre, and go on a holiday.

1212,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am inclined to agree with the statement that people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful. I have certain reasons to agress with this statement which I will discuss later in my essays. I would also like to highlight the fact that taking such risks might not get the success in the 1st attempt, sometimes people need to attempt multiple times. The main reason for this my view is that I believe in the ""More risk, More gain"" philosophy. If I decide to get into some new business/idea, which nobody has tried, I need comparatively more resources in terms of money, time and effort to pursue this new venture. There is a chance that this new venture could fail, but on the positive note if that business/idea succeeds , I would have a tremendous potential to make money in this new business as I will not have much competition. I will give an example of John Chambers, CEO of a networking company. This company was traditionally in the business of selling networking devices. As its business became more mature and competition increased , John decided to take some risks and expanded into the telephony business and became successful in this new business. This company ranks as number one in telephone business. The 2nd reason for my view is that unless I venture into unknown territories I will not know what lies there. As a human, we always have this comfort zone which we do not want to leave but there is no guarantee that there is no risk in what we are doing today. My brother has a gift business and he was very comfortable in that business. I insisted him to try exporting business, though he was initially reluctant but he tried and became successful. In conclusion, I believe that risk taking is a shirt cut to success which we should try.","['I am inclined to agree with the statement that people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful.

1216,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I feel that young people enjoy their life more than the older ones because young people don't have any responsibilities. For example compare a girl to her mother. Basically a girl only has a responsibility to study and if she has finished doing it, she probably enjoys it by freeking out with friends to a good place orby going to some friends'house. But her mother who has a lot of responsibility like her daughter,and the other child she has so basically she is busy withher responsibilities. she doesn't at least not find time to enjoy herself. And if she is a working woman she has to move to her job in the morning and when she returns home she needs to do some work like cooking and cleaning the home. So finally she is tired at the end of the day and she doesn't at least have time to enjoy herself and she feels it is time to take a rest. But basically enjoying yourself also depends on the people's character some people are there who really enjoy their work they feel that they enjoy doing their work properly. And some people enjoy it all the time by making fun. I feel age is not a matter to enjoy or responsibilities are not a part which stop people enjoying  themselves. And the older people really enjoy it when they complete their responsibilities in a proper way and feel proud and they do enjoy their job.","[""I feel that young people enjoy their life more than the older ones because young people don't have any responsibilities.

Most young people do not spend their time helping their communities. It is real nowadays. Lots of young people are personalized people nowadays. They do not think about others' situations. The only thing they focused on was their own problem. Moreover, young people nowadays do not like activity or performance, rather like staying at home. At home, they play computer games or video games. They even communicate with their friends on line and not off-line. For example, they chat and do group homework via a messenger program on a computer. It is natural that these two boys do not like helping their communities. Helping communities needs lots of activity. Studying harder than in the past is one reason, too.

It is because they know the reason why they are successful is because no one can replace their specialities. Moreover, doing what they are skilled at can prevent them from being lost. That a person has a job that no one can replace his or her position is a very important factor for a successful person. My father always told me that I have to find my interests, and become very skilled in that field. I totally believe those words because a successful person knows his interests and keeps studying them until he knows a lot about his interests. Take my professor for example, she is very good at translation. Thus, when some of the faculty members want to translate their books into English, they all ask my professor for help. They won't think about others. My professor can earn a lot of money by doing translation. Therefore, successful people will only do what they already know how to do because they know no one can replace them. Moreover, a successful person is successful because he does anything to prevent himself from being failed. Can a successful person still succeed when he is failed? I don't think so. For example, there was once a well-known company in my country. They were famous because they could produce nicely-looking computers. Every body liked to use their computer.","[""Some people may think that successful people always try new things and take risks.

1221,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three advantages. First, as you travel in a group led by a tour guide, the tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see on the journey. For example, if you want to go sightseeing, a tour guide will escort you to the sight. The tour guide will be responsible for whatever traveler wants to do. They just don' t have to worry about reserving a restaurant or doing some special activities. Especially when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoken in the country where they travel to. Second, since going travelling with a group, they will definitely get along with each other and have fun. If traveling alone, you won't be able to have much fun as traveling with a group. Third, traveling on a gourp with a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone. Of course a tour guide knows about the location where it is not safe enough to go so they won't go to the dangerous side of the city. Ever since transportation has developed amagingly, the world is getting closer. We can go to another side of the world by airplane in ten hours or it may take a day to get there. It used to take about two, three months to get to other countries. The world is getting more dangerous, most people have guns and knives. so traveling with a tour guide is very helpful for the traveler. In my experiences, I have been to Australia on my own. It was still scary to go there by myself. Especially in the town centre. When I went to town, I lost my wallet. i didn't lose my passport, though.","[""I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

1222,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Responsibility plays a big role in our life, especially for older people. when a young child is having fun and he doesn't care about money, home and issues that happen to any person. Young people think that they still have good health but when they get older their health will start to go down. I agree with young people who want to have more fun than older people for a couple of reasons. First of all, responsibility as I mentioned in the beginning, makes any person think about how to make his life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do. For example in any family, the father always thinks about how to get money for his children, the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially. If we look at the children, we can notice that they want to play everyday and have fun without thinking about anything. That was a good example of showing the difference in how young and old people act. The second reason is that old people always start to take care of their health which absolutely goes down as they get older. On the other hand, young people think about no responsibility and no problems with their health, so why don't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future. For example, if someone is 60 years old and he is retired from his job, he could have health problems and refuse him to enjoy his life.","[""Responsibility plays a big role in our life, especially for older people. when a young child is having fun and he doesn't care about money, home and issues that happen to any person.

1223,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I certainly dont agree with the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". If a person wants to enjoy his/her life they can enjoy it no matter how old they are. Enjoying life doesnt depend on how old a person is, however; it depends on how the person is. being sociable, appreciating what you have, and having a positive way of thinking are all characteristics a person contains but it differs in people, what kind of person they are. Being a sociable person has a major affect on a person. If a person dislikes being around people then he / she wont be able to enjoy life because he/she is not seeing people from different cultures that entertain you.

In addition, many young people these days also go to the movie theatre to watch the movies. In the movie theatre, we could choose the movie we want to watch.

1266,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. An advertisement can use all of the five physical human senses, but the advertisements people normally experience are visual and auditory. The simplest and the most common form of advertisement is the visual form, such as advertisements in magazines, newspapers, and the ones on billboards. When concentrating on the visual effect, the advertisement needs an aesthetic, or visual impact which could grab a potential customer by a glance, or a message motivating the reader to buy the product. The advertisement may appeal to the reader by highlighting the efficiency, advantage, uniqueness of the product. However, for every advertisement, the quintessential motto is : buy me. In order to attract the reader, an advertisement at times uses the effects of eye-grasping exaggeration. With such aesthetically alluring visual pictures -with the help of modern technology, photography, or literature , an advertisement nearly blinds the reader depending on the reader's class, culture, or sex.","['Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

The advertisements appear everywhere people go because the industries want to make their product well known in the area where they are doing the campaign. An example of products that use alot of marketing are all the soda industries. Like Coca Cola or Pepsi both of these businesses use lots of advertisements that say that their product is better than the other. Another example of this is the tobacco industry, because the advertisements that they do of cigarettes tell people that they should smoke and they dont tell that the product is harmful to health.

These people have mostly spent a lot of time trying new stuff and experiencing new things,and that is why these people can succeed. Therefore, a lot of the time, it is true that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. People who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well often succeed. These people often work really hard to find new stuff and new ideas. People who want to succeed often need to take risks in order to succeed. Although they might not end up living with good respect or beliefs from other people, their successes are undoubtable. For instance, one of the famous scientists who had exclaimed that the earth is round ended up in jail for a while, but his successful career is now no doubt that his theory was right. Therefore, people who are able to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know what to do well often succeed. On the other hand, people who do not try new things and take risks but only doing what they already know how to do well do not often succeed. If a person does not try new things and discovers new things, one will only be a professional in one's field. Meanwhile, that person would be a really tiny chance to find new things like those who succeed.

He can even describe how it is going on and what is wrong and right. I state that understanding the concept is the main criteria of the subject or lecture. If a student understands a concept thoroughly he can score good marks and he never forgets that concept and ideas in his life time. This is the way of a student to develop his thinking and he can easily grasp the facts going around. Ideas and concepts play an important role in the present education system and present world.

They want to sell their products to earn their money and many people have the experience that when you buy something home and realize that it is not useful, it is just like what appeared in an advertisement.

Therefore, they need to urge customers to buy. They will use everything to urge you to buy their products. Although it looks not good to eat, advertisements will use the pictures or sounds to make it look delicious. Then, advertisements use people's desire to sell their product. For example, an advertisement in which a hot model holds a diet drink will make many women buy it, because they want to be a hot model.

1302,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Schools that teach k-12 students require students to study various subjects.

A student might agree that the subjects that they are learning in school are useless and meaningless to learn. This is not true because as you grow more mature you will realize that the thing you learned in school really comes to help in real life. So it is better to study and have knowledge of various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject. It may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that requires those knowledges you learned. Well, this is just in your carrier. When you get out into the social world, the things you learned are too professional that no one, but you and people who work with them understand. If you want to get involved in social life and understand life better, it is better to know many things. For example, when you go to a party where all kinds of different people gather. You want to talk to people, but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topics that people talk about. As a result, you will be secluded and feel alone.

1303,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Almost everyone tries to gain more enjoyable time from life. Being young or old to have more happiness, which is best to have fun? When one is young, he has lots of responsibilities,such as exams or decisions for the rest of his life. These are really great aspects of his life. What about olders? They do not have many responsibilities except their health. In my opinion,young people enjoy life more than older people do. Actually, they have more chance to enjoy themselves in terms of their health and enjoyment opportunities. Although having big responsibilities, young people can have more energy for fun.

Being young or old to have more happiness, which is best to have fun? When one is young, he has lots of responsibilities,such as exams or decisions for the rest of his life. These are really great aspects of his life. What about olders? They do not have many responsibilities except their health. In my opinion,young people enjoy life more than older people do.

1304,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The tendency of the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is right. I think so because I am a person who acts risky and I have always had success. But before you generalize you have to know what risk means in this context. Risk according to your career is to be brave to live and work or study in a foreign country for longer than 3 months. Risk in terms of success in my opinion is to apply for another job even though you are happy and safe right now with your situation. My risk started after I finished my internship at Neuss County Council as an IT-Specialist. Working for a government facility is quite secure. The chance that you will lose your job is low. But I have thought that this cannot be everything in my life. I wanted to apply for a job in a call center because I thought that talking to people might help my problem of communication. I applied for the best call center in my region and I worked for Microsoft. Even now I am writing my thesis to graduate at Microsoft Germany. I also worked and studied one semester in the United States. The time scale here is approximately 10 months. My exchange semester in South Korea and my internship at the Korean German Chamber of Commerce and Industry were also great experiences. If I review my journey right now and compare it to some friends who never left the city where we graduated high school I can definitely say that I have an advanced status. The reason for this conclusion is because this friend of mine applied for the same internship program. So the arguments are not only my thoughts but my experience. Additionally, my friend had to admit that I always have something to talk about. And we figured out that the more information you get the more opportunities you can turn into successful projects. Right now I am preparing to build up my own business because I have contacts worldwide. And not every person in the world likes to do business unpersonally with people through the internet.","['The tendency of the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is right.

You only have to evaluate the k. o. criterias which could be essential to have or to lose.

As long as I am young I will always set new milestones to achieve my long-term goal of having a great life with my future family.

However, I agree with the topic for two reasons : capability and social relationships. I will explain these reasons in detail. To begin with, broad knowledge is a capability which has one of the factors in modern society. Nowadays society wants people who have diverse abilities. Also, many universities offer various curriculums to students. For example, my sister has many abilities, such as English ability and resources of economy, policy and art. So when she meets people, almost all people like my sister. One day, she went to the bank to exchange his dollars. Hence, she saw some foreigner. So she asked for something to happen and the man answered that he did not find their company, Therefore, she talked to him and resolved the problem, After that, she got some requests to get a job. This means that ability is useful for living in society. Second, it is good for sustaining social relationships. People want to make relationships with brilliant people. Moreover, they need to obtain a good qualification to get  a job. Besides, many private institutes to learn creat in our society. Among them, language courses are a good example. At my University, Kookmin University, there are many courses in language such as Chinese, Japanese and English. Consequently, many people concentrate on the course. Therefore, the courses are finished enrolling. Also, my university offers a conversation course for students. It means that it is useful for students.

And also there are many students who choose their subjects at university in social areas like medicine or law to help other people.

But I find more advantages to studying many academic subjects. First, I think if their knowledge is broad, They can have a wider view. For instance, as the internet has been invented and a better transportation system has developed, you go abroad more frequently. Also you become to see many people who have different backgrounds. At that time, you have to recognize and understand other cultures or history. If you don't have a wide view, you can't understand and it may be a conflict. Second, today , it's a really complicated connected society so it's really important to study several academic subjects.

The reason why I am in agreement with this is that I suppose that successful people are dedicated to making better in any way they operate, and they want everytime a new target, much more difficult from the past, to obtain. For this reason they try new things and sometimes they take risks but this gives them the sensation of the power and the potential they have. The normal people see them and consider that in the same situation or position they didn't take risks fairly like successful people do. Infact normal people many times, consider successful people too much out of the world for the reason that I mentioned at last. Contrary to what ordinary people think I consider that successful people go in another way from normal people because, if it is not true, they can be successful people. The success of a person is given first of all by nature because a successful person, before he had success, he was born with a particular ability in speaking, playing in general and making better wath he had to do, respect other people. With the growth of the person, success comes to the people that had this particular ability since they were young and for this reason they became ""effective"" successful people. Society in general considers that taking risks is the best way to safeguard or die. I support a different position, and this is that if a man doesn't take many risks in his life continues to be the ordinary man that he is. But if a man takes many risks (not everytime, but sometimes) it is a sign of that he could be a successful person. The successful people have to their part the luck, infact sometimes they do an activity with much more success than normal people could obtain.","['I am in accordance with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

My own experiences are that I myself help a lot in my community and lots of my friends do so too. An other point one has to have in mind is how young people feel in the community. If they are happy with the world around them the help of young people is logical, but if they have no friends and fun at work it is logical that they are not willing to help the community and prefer to sit in their room next to the computer or television. Besides that the government could try to make help and work of young people more public, so that young people can see, that they can help and perhaps can have a better feeling throughout that, what they have done. For me it would be important to show which goals young people can achieve.

1338,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"During their all long period of education and graduation, students are learning many things on different topics and are developing many skills. That gives them the opportunity to improve some of them. Is that more important for a student to understand what he is learning, or just to keep things in mind without any explanations or added value ? On the one hand, I think that it is essential for a student to understand what is being taught to him for the simple evidence that he will better keep it in mind. If we take the example of an economic classroom, it will be more efficient for the student to understand the concept of "" liberalism"" for instance by understanding the way it works and its features, than just knowing the fact that this is an economic way in opposition to others as "" socialism"". But on the other hand, it is sometimes difficult for a student to understand every aspect of an idea or a concept. This made the fact that some students are tough in one area and weak in an other one. In this case it would be a better way for the student just to learn his class without any more understanding, just like a robot.","['During their all long period of education and graduation, students are learning many things on different topics and are developing many skills.

1340,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are many disadvantages to following the tour guide. Even getting a tour guide can be harmful and dangerous for tourists. First of all,when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel,you can only see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group. You can not find out around the city. Everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide. For example,you want to see the other side of the city,but there is a certain travel program which includes seeing certain places in the city. You have to follow the travel program. Secondly,People who are from that city can understand that you are a tourist. This system has some difficulties. They can cheat on you or sell kind of present things to you much more expensively. For example,when you go to a store for shopping,if they understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist they can try to sell many things much more expensive,but if you travel alone and you can speak the language of that country which you want to see they can not understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist. So people who are from that country or that city can sell things to you for the original price. Third of all, traveling with groups is not an expensive activity but it is also very dangerous. There are many terrorist people or groups who want to kidnap tourists and foreign people to come true their bad purposes. Those kinds of people can realize that you are a tourist,because you are travelling with the group and following the tour guide. They can kidnap you and kill you. Furthermore they can use you for their purposes. That situation happened with tourists many times. Those people killed the tourists or got money from the tourists of the family.","['I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

It is not a fact which is proved scientifically that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As for me, when you get older you will learn what kind of facilities and activities make you happy or unhappy. Because of experiencing more than younger  people, being older has lots of advantages. Firstly, young people are more interested in trying new things. But it is not sure that they will enjoy what they do. They will experience an action to learn something. Sometimes this can lead young people to be unhappier than before. On the other hand, when you become older, I am sure that you will be more clear about new things. Moreover, when somebody gets older, he or she generally becomes what sort of actions change the mood positively. As a result of these experiences, old people get a better time though they have fewer times to live than young people have. Secondly, the ages lived teach people to be more patient. That is why older people tend to insist on doing something even though they were very unsuccessful at it before.","['I do not agree that life is more enjoyable for young people than for elderly people.

For example, you don't need to think about which hotel you should choose to stay in, where you have a meal, and which cars or trains you should take. Every thing is arranged well by the tour guide. The only thing you need to do is to follow the group, see beautiful sights and enjoy them fully. Also, you can get a lot of knowledge and insight from the presentation of a tour guide. Tour guides are given good training or education in how to introduce the information about sight to tourists. In this sense, they are professional people who are most familiar with the information of sight. Having an introduction from the tour guide, I believe all of you will get comprehensive knowledge without any efforts. However, when you take a lonely trip, no one provides this kind of service and you may miss the best chance to learn about the world. Moreover, there are often many people in a travel group. I am a sociable person and I like to do many things with other people. I hate loneliness.","[""I totally agree with this statement.

1351,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I think being specialised in one specific subject is good, but is not enough for your personal development. First of all, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is better to improve your communication with people. I mean, if your knowledge is really broad,you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of different subjects with a lot of different people. Being open minded in your knowledge leads you, most of the time, to being open minded socially. It is important to be interested in several things, that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations, and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point; whatever you actually want to do in life. Furthermore, the more you learn, the more you want to learn (and need to learn actually). The desire to learn can be found if you are specializing in one specific subject, but a single subject may lead you to isolate yourself in technical considerations that no one can actually understand, whereas plurality of subjects makes your mind breathe. It is no longer a question of 'academic"" knowledge, it is a question of curiosity. According to me, acknowledgement goes the same way as it goes for food, that is to say if you eat the same food everyday, you will just be quickly disgusted. Therefore, if you just study one single subject, even if you go deeply through it, you will be disgusted one day somewhat. To summarize, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can thus talk about more things, and it makes you so curious as if you were majoring in one specific subject.","['I think being specialised in one specific subject is good, but is not enough for your personal development.

From the first car that appeared in our lives, their quantity has not stopped increasing. So, which will be the future for the car? Nowadays car is an important part of our life. We use it for everything because everything is easier with it. On average a normal citizen could move around 20 kms per day in his car to go to work, shopping or whatever. That's seems to be going to be the most predictable future thanks to being the most comfortable way of living. However there is something that grows at the same pattern as cars: traffic. A lot of researchers say that traffic is the disease of the actual cities. When it appears it is nearly impossible to control it. This is something that goes against cars because when people last double time to do the same route, one question starts to appear: Do I have other means of transport? In fact our society has a variety of transport we had never imagined, but they are not so easy-going as cars are. Although it is proved that they are faster and cheaper than our cars, people do not like them. Statements like the bus is crowded, I have to walk a lot to the train station. are very common and set public transport behind cars, except when they do not depend on traffic jams and allow people to sleep some minutes more before going to work. The environment is another thing we have to take care of. The Kyoto protocol is clear in that aspect: most production of greenhouse effect gasses is caused by private transport. So it is not so difficult as in 20 years time cars will be banned from downtown, like in London Happens at themoment. As a conclusion predictions about cars are difficult to state.

Once upon a time, everyone knew all the members of their town, and there was not anyone who did not know anyone in their town, because they always cared about their neighborhoods. However the apartment does not give them any chance to meet their neighbours. One more, the jobs are getting more professional. Everyone engages in different parts of jobs. So they do not have a chance to think about their neighbourhoods and communities. So the reasons i think are studying, apartment and professionalizing of jobs.

They will have to go to academies after school, and they will be so tired. After the academies, they will fall asleep right after arriving at home. This culture makes this society like that.

It is obvious that there are more and more cars on the streets nowadays. But has anyone aware of the huge loss of energy? Probably not. Cars will not work without gasoline. As more and more gasoline is purchased, it becomes scarcer. In the economic view, when a good or service is getting scarced, the price of the individual good or service will increase. That is what's happening with gasoline nowadays. As the price of gasoline rises, the living expenses also increase. In the end, people will not use cars as much as we do now. And this is because of the scarcity of energy needed for cars. When the situation of scarcity of energy is happening, people tend to find many ways to solve this problem. The innovation of transportation might be the solution to this problem. Scientists who work on energy development might create new energy instead of the traditional energy, gasoline. With the help of these scientists, the solution will either be having new forms of energy, or new forms of cars that consume less gasoline. Therefore, traditional cars will no longer be used in twenty years. In conclusion, the scarcity of energy and the innovation of technology can reduce the number of cars in the next twenty years. Scarcity of energy leads to the rise in living expenses, which will finally force people not to use cars as much as they do now. The innovation of technology will help develop new forms of energy that will not be used by cars, and new tools of transportation other than cars.","[""Cars are one of the modern modes of transportation nowadays, which are commonly used by everyone.

And this is because of the scarcity of energy needed for cars. When the situation of scarcity of energy is happening, people tend to find many ways to solve this problem. The innovation of transportation might be the solution to this problem. Scientists who work on energy development might create new energy instead of the traditional energy, gasoline. With the help of these scientists, the solution will either be having new forms of energy, or new forms of cars that consume less gasoline. Therefore, traditional cars will no longer be used in twenty years. In conclusion, the scarcity of energy and the innovation of technology can reduce the number of cars in the next twenty years. Scarcity of energy leads to the rise in living expenses, which will finally force people not to use cars as much as they do now."", 'The innovation of technology will help develop new forms of energy that will not be used by cars, and new tools of transportation other than cars.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
1366,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"There are some people who think travelling led by a tour guide is better, but others prefer to travel alone instead of being guided by a tour guide. But I would have to say, if I was faced with this issue, I would probably follow the tour guide's leading in a group. In the following discussion, I would like to reason and provide examples to support my viewpoint. No issue is more important now than the one that refers to safety. History witnesses and presents many examples of when travelling by oneself may cause some dangers or trouble. For example, we go to a less developed country,such as China, and take money in hand, this behavior may cause some dangers. Or when we travel to an European country with unpolished dressing. Don't you think the examples quoted above are very persuasive? Convenience is another head and chief reason that I have chosen to put it here. It is no better illustration that can demonstrate the view. If the trip is not convenient, it will take the travellers too much energy to enjoy their trips. Even family as a couple. they will be uncomfortable on a busy trip. Superior as leading by a tour guide, leading by tour guide or deciding on a trip by yourself also has its own demerits, too. Deciding on a trip course may take a lot of time and may lose something interesting. Leading a tour guide may lose one's freedom to find something else besides the tour. Nevertheless, the advantages of leading by a tour guide carry more weight than the disadvantages of leading by a tour guide. So the most striking conclusion is obvious. To sum up, given the reasons discussed above, which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive, we can safely reach the conclusion that leading by a tour guide on a trip is more safe and convenient. In fact, not only do I prefer to travel leading by a tour guide in a group, but also prefer to hire a personal tour guide for one's own tour guide to serve himself as well as possible.","[""There are some people who think travelling led by a tour guide is better, but others prefer to travel alone instead of being guided by a tour guide.

1367,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I totally agree with this statement. I agree with this, firstly because I am a forensic scientist, and so during my formation, we had to learn things about all academic branches. For example physics, biology, chemistry, law, etc. But more seriously, it ` s really important to have good instruction, it permits you to express yourself in a lot of conversation and so to speak with a lot of people from various specialities. It is not only useful for public relations, you can use it when you watch TV or read the newspaper, too. Sometimes it`s already really difficult for me to understand what they are talking about on the news on TV. One other thing is that today, with all the media we have, it has become really easy to learn about a lot of academic fields, not really deeply, it`s sure, but sufficiently to understand how the world is going. I can understand people who won`t open their minds to other fields. I am of this kind when you are talking about business or politics. In fact we can`t be interested in everything, but we can interest ourselves in so many things that it would be a shame not to profite fromthis opportunity. Just to put a tragic accent on this essay, we can say that the lack of knowledge is what leads to all the extreme nations our world has known as fascism or really hard communism as in the ancient SovietUnion. In fact, if Hitler had learned to know the Jews and if the inhabitants of the ancient Soviet Union had known what was going on outside the Union, these ``terror`` nations wouldn`t have lived so long!

Where would the human race be if our ancestors hadn't taken risks? The desire to do something new and unexperienced or unknown allows development. If Columbus hadn't taken a risk no one would have known about Amerika. Many of our scientific achievements are the results of taking risks. If no one had tried to fly (at the beginning with some strange looking machines) and with that would have taken the risk of breaking an arm or a leg we would still travel by ship (if we are willing to take the risk of sinking). Persons who took a risk are those who are standing in our books and those who achieved something in life and for the human race. But lets just look at a more personal level. If we are willing to take risks we are also open to new experiences. If a person is willing to get to know different cultures and views and is leaving her/his comfort zone, that person will learn something beneficial to her/his life. I would say that taking risks is one of my basic human needs.","[""Taking risks and getting to know the unknown is an important part of being able to move forward and experiencing new things, which is why I strongly agree with the statement.

1382,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I disagree with this statement. As a young person myself, I really do not have the feeling to enjoy my life as much as I could. Without having any health issues, nor special disabilities that old people might have on a daily basis, I am just so concerned about my future that it does not permit me to appreciate the enjoyment of life. As young people, your entire life is devoted to the preparation of the future and to how to cope with the responsibilities that accompany life as an adult: young people have to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the apartment to have a family and to afford it. This is why a young person might go through his youth without enjoyment. As an example, most students do, during their studies, a job or an internship, to have money for some higher studies or to complete them with professional experience that might be taken into account by their future employer. In such circumstances, how can they enjoy their lives as students? They have no time to go to students' parties, or they are too tired. Besides, most of them are conscious that these years were supposed to be the best, as their parents told them. Young people do not enjoy life like older people do, and they probably enjoy it less than older people do.","[""I disagree with this statement.

1395,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but there are several reasons for this and it is not always the case. With the huge rise in consumption society, more and more products are proposed to the customers. Most of the products are really similar. How does the difference between two bottles of water which have the same price make a difference? This is the role of communication and advertising. Companies will present the products in a better way. They will associate it with a lot of qualities and significations. With advertising, companies create the image of the product, and this image makes the difference when the customers buy the products. So, the customers don't have to mix the real qualities and specificities of a product and his image. For example, a brand of water shown in one of his advertisements is about babies dancing and swimming in waters. That doesn't mean that each person who drinks this water becomes a baby and jumps directly into a swimming pool. A second problem for companies is how to sell a cake or a fragrance by advertising? People can't taste or smell the product. Consequently, advertisements suggest the flavour or the taste of the product, and as everybody has his personal tastes and preferences, everybody doesn't always agree with the advertisement. Finally, advertising doesn't always present the products in a better way than reality. Advertisements are controlled by law and the associations of customers. Companies can't lie about theirproducts, lying advertising is punished by law and in this case the company loses all its credibility and the trust of itscustomers. To conclude, advertising makes a product seem better to make business. It doesn't lie, it improves the reality.","[""I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but there are several reasons for this and it is not always the case.

1396,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Old people and young people do not have the same activities, hobbies, and tastes. In fact, your life is totally different from an age to an other. While young people study older people have more responsibilities. However when people are young they are not considerate as adults so they can do what ever they wish : have fun with their friends, party a lot, not take care of the house, not have duties. However, they have to work a lot to get a good future. Young people choose in a way what they will be after. If they study well, they can have a better job. This isn't a great joy, you are in competition with all of yourfriends, you might lose some friends for better grades. So in order to have fun after school they have to be determined. Nevertheless, after school when you get a nice job well paid you will still have to work hard all your life. It's not easy, it's stressful. People can be alone, when you are at school you have the opportunity to make a lot of friends because you come from the same area, the same town, you have the same interests whereas when people get older they feellonely, sometimes because they don't like their jobs or it's hard for them to be part of the workforce.

Successful people who try new things and take risks will be more success ful than other people who are afraid to take the risks and try new things ; because they will limit what they can learn and they could help.

1398,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Young People And The Community I think that I would have to agree with this statement, according to nowadays young people dont help or participate enough in their own communities, and I mainly think that this is because of the world today and its busy busy busy life. Because nowadays a lot of young people can't even afford to lose time on playing or engaging in any kind of fun activities, Because they can barely make it from home to college and from college to their part time work (if they have one) and then going home again to do their chores and finish studying and doing their homework , which takes a lot of them dropping them beat on the bed at the end of the day. But then again this does not apply to every young person, some people choose not to participate in their own communities because they do not think that the community itself is not doing a good job maintaining things at hand, and so they dont want to interfere with the bumpy roads ahead. But also there is quite a fair amount of young people with plenty of free time who would love to help their communities to prosper and to feel good about them selves as individuals in doing so, and not to forget that working pro bono for the community means no money, and not many people who would want to waste their time and not get paid in the end, so sticking to their jobs is the better answer for their time. So in conclusion, I do agree with the statement that young people dont give enough time to help their own communities, but at the same time I disagree that they should help the community and give their time and efforts away on the count of their futures, but this does not apply to those young people who dont think and give much time to their future or their community because they should, after all,.","[""Young People And The Community I think that I would have to agree with this statement, according to nowadays young people dont help or participate enough in their own communities, and I mainly think that this is because of the world today and its busy busy busy life.

1410,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I think that the statement will probably not reflect the real vision of the future. In twenty years there will be hopefully more cars than today. Cars represent a material good which everyone in modern society must have in order to keep up with the world outside. Whatever you do, you need a car. Wherever you go, you need a car. It's definitely a must. That's why i believe the number of cars will increase in the future. Also, long distances are now an everyday part of life. Most of today's jobs usually require a car in order to get around, to go anywhere. In fact it is so common now to move from city to city for work, and many people find it easier to move by car, since the bad service of trains or planes often end up being annoying and stressing. In fact, when you have to catch a train , It often happens that the train is delayed. the same happens with planes. So you find yourselves waiting for hours at the train station or at the airport, telling yourself "" I should have used my car! "". That's one of the reasons I do believe people would rather use their car than take public transportation. Therefore, if people need to use the car, whoever doesn't own one, will need to buy one, and that will increase the number of cars. Besides, I believe that we should also consider the young people in order to forsee that the numbers of cars will definitely increase in the next few years. In fact we have to take into account how important kids are withinsociety. They represent the customers of the future. They will also be the cars' buyers of the future. Young kids can't wait to turn eighteen years old only to get their driver'slicence. They look forward to having their own car, because they want to feel independent, free, they want to turn into adults finally. One of the feelings to feel like a grown up man or woman is driving your car. your own car represents a piece of the world of yours. Only yours.","['I think that the statement will probably not reflect the real vision of the future. In twenty years there will be hopefully more cars than today. Cars represent a material good which everyone in modern society must have in order to keep up with the world outside. Whatever you do, you need a car. Wherever you go, you need a car. It\'s definitely a must. That\'s why i believe the number of cars will increase in the future. Also, long distances are now an everyday part of life. Most of today\'s jobs usually require a car in order to get around, to go anywhere. In fact it is so common now to move from city to city for work, and many people find it easier to move by car, since the bad service of trains or planes often end up being annoying and stressing. In fact, when you have to catch a train , It often happens that the train is delayed. the same happens with planes. So you find yourselves waiting for hours at the train station or at the airport, telling yourself "" I should have used my car! "". That\'s one of the reasons I do believe people would rather use their car than take public transportation. Therefore, if people need to use the car, whoever doesn\'t own one, will need to buy one, and that will increase the number of cars. Besides, I believe that we should also consider the young people in order to forsee that the numbers of cars will definitely increase in the next few years.

Second ,if i was a businessman, I think my goal would be to get the most profit that i can. Thus ,i will buy poor material and then manufacture it , sell it, and use advertising to show why my product is better than an other one. So i will just emphasize all the qualities.

I agree with this statement. There are several reasons for this. One does not have to waste time learning facts and also experience can help students to learn facts. Just understanding the idea and concept can also help to be more creative. It is a waste of time giving students everything about the topic. They need to run their own brains to understand what the whole lecture is about. For example in an art class, the teacher wants students to create a new tool for thekitchen. He gives the idea about what he wants but if he gives the facts they do not have to search for anything to increase their knowledge and ability as well. They can not look from a different perspective. Experience is one of the most important points to learn something. For instance, you studied for your lesson and you got your driving licence. Without having experience of how you expect to drive as well as the others can. Experience is more important than learning facts. You give the idea and concept. Afterwards they experience it in real life by facing them. Being flexible in our creations depends on how free we are. Just having ideas can help you be more creative.

So that's more important, it is'nt the basic information but the way of reflection. It's generally the same for every scientific topic.

1418,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"When I read this statement, I automatically think that it is right, young people enjoy life more than older people do. But if I think about it, it appears to be, in fact, the contrary. It is true that young people have discovered everything. When one is born, one has to learn and to build all of who one wants to be. Therefore, a young person has to try and to search for all that he can, to know who he is. In that sense, he enjoys life more than older people, who already know who they are. It is also true that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life than older people. The education system permits them to meet many different people, until the entrance to professional life : the student has to change his educational place all his student life, with the school, the high school, the college, etc. At the contrary, older people already have a durable placement in their company, and therefore have fewer occasions to meet other people. Finally, we know that young people do sports and have activities that older people can not exercise. That is the first impression that I had when I read the statement. But I am young and that is why my spirit only saw advantages for young people. If I am objective, it is obvious that older people also enjoy life. They have their life already lined up, that is true, but all the examples of adults around me show me that it is not a reason for us to stop their hobbies and to stay at home without doing anything to enjoy their life. My father, for instance, decided to quit my mother because he found his life too calm. He has many friends, and now he profits from everything more than, even if I am younger. With the world of today, and globalization, we can have only one job for our entire life, that is why older people have the opportunity to change their lives, to discover other things and other fields.","['When I read this statement, I automatically think that it is right, young people enjoy life more than older people do.

1419,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In many schools and institutions it is believed that the importance of learning is by memorizing facts and concepts other than actually understanding them. We are facing two very different types of learning and teaching, and I personally think that the best way is to integrate and comprehend. In the older days, teachers left instructions for the students to memorize and copy facts, dates, names, numbers, among other things. Then, the student wouldn't have passed even 1 year and he would have forgotten everything the History teacher told him to memorize about the second world war. It wouldn't have been of any use memorizing in the first place. Now, on the other hand, I think that a more modern type of teaching is by making the student identify the problems and understand the answers. For example, in mathematics or physics, instead of the teacher giving the formula to meassure the air, or to find a number, let the student find the formula by himself. In a way, I think this type of teaching helps the student to develop certain abilities and its easier for them to solve problems in the near or distantfuture. I think it is very important to actually use the whole percentage of brain we are capable of using and to think, and figure out our own answers. We are not born with the abilities we have, but we reforce them, make them stronger. In my personal opinion, it is much more important for us (students) to understand and comprehend ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn and memorize them. Besides, memorizing is always boring.

1420,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"In my opinion, traveling the world with a group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money. First of all, while they give you time to explore places, it's a very short time, so you miss out on lots of things that are necessary. Secondly, crashing a bus that drives for hours and hours without knowing anybody or anywhere just isn't a fun thing to do. Finally, some tour guides don't even know what they are talking about, and don't talk when they are supposed to, so you have to take risks on picking the right time and date. Let's say that you went to an University of Harvard, and they have lots to see like the science center, and famous people who graduated from that place like Bill Gates. So the tour guides tell you to explore places within half an hour which is a very short period of time in such a large place. So while you are looking at unnecessary things, time goes by, and you miss out on the important things like the golden statue. Also if you don't make it in time for the bus, they all complain about waiting for you eventhough it is just for a minute. Eventhough, you go to places with your family or friends, they have lots of other people on the bus who are traveling with you. You could get bored only by talking to your family members or your friends. But some people don't care, because they also have TV's on the bus to entertain you, but it only entertains me a bit. Then all you hear is chattering going on and on beside you and infront of you. You can't tell them to be quiet, because they will point fingers at you and even curse you. The other thing is that if you want to sleep, and lean back your chair a bit, they complain to you about how uncomfortable it is which is very annoying. The Great Wall of China. It has lots of history and legends to it. Surely, people want to know about it, but the tour guide doesn't even say a word about it, and even if he talks aloud, he doesn't know what he is saying. Well i am not saying that every tour guide acts like that, but if you pick the wrong time and date, you will have to face the consequences. Therefore, i disagree with the statement. First of all, the tour guide doesn't give you the right timing for you to explore the place. Secondly, you barely know anybody on the bus except for people who came with you, and finally the tour guide would stink if you picked the wrong bus.","[""In my opinion, traveling the world with a group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money.

1426,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It`s quite common to hear judgments about young people nowadays. It`s even quite popular to think that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someone else'slife. Well, I think It`s the way adults usually use to solve some of their internal problems, completely not tied to what the reality is. The reality is that young people nowadays spend much more time helping their community than before, and I think these habits will increase in the future. Modern life has brought us to stress our time in order to do as much as we can: or better, in order to earn as much as we can. This behaviour entails an important aspect: the rising of a new concept of common culture. What I want to say is that now every young person is sufficiently prepared to understand that it is better to work and to make efforts for the community instead of behaving selfishly. Any good action can only improve the common happiness, but our happiness is just inside this commonwealth. It`s even more and more evident how young people are trying to destroy old stereotypes of thinking about what is different. Although until a few years ago hostile behaviour among human races was deeply radiated in common thinking, new social dynamics are strongly addressing young people to accept every kind of difference. Thus making it easier and faster the growing of a new common sense of belonging to a community; and it ` s this new sense of belonging to make us spend more time with this new family. Anyway the increase in the number of young people involved in volunteer groups , such as medical teams in poor areas of the world or even very young people helping elderly people , is a confirmation of what I ` vestated. In conclusion, I can even well understand why many adults think that most young people are poor in spirit : are not they to teach us in university classes that the only god we must pray to is money? And the only way to earn money isn`t time?.","[""It`s quite common to hear judgments about young people nowadays.

1430,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Success is a very common word that people use very frequently to express their ambitions. It is probably the best goal someone may have and it can be reached in every field, but how? The main element needed to have success is studying. Studying will always bring somewhere better than where you are now and this is another great goal to which you should always aim at in your life. Another fundamental factor is risk. Risk is not a very common word, because when it is used, it usually represents a very difficult and intense situation. Apart from businessmen, people don't like this word very much. As a matter of fact, it is mainly used in business discussions. In economics, risk is what leads to success. For instance in stock exchanges, no one who hasn't ever risked is successful, and never will be. In business, you are compelled to gamble on tons and tons of factors that will determine the way through of your day and consequently of your life earnings. There is a great motto that states the importance of this curious behaviour risks, no earns! ""It is a hundred percent correct and it illustrates very exhaustively what people's behaviour should be like. Yes, because risks are not to take only in business fields. Risks are at the basis of worthwhile living, morally and economically speaking. If this behaviour occurs, people would not do what they already do well, but they would improve. Improving implies some risks initially, but paradoxically in the end, it always brings you to riduce risks and gains in your life.

There are many churches, cultural monuments, and famous concert halls to visit. I could not choose where to go first or where I definitely should go. However, when I travel with a group and a tour guide, the tour guide planned everything and scheduled everything efficiently. I do not have to waste time making decisions, and also I never miss famous places to visit. Sometimes it is hard to find a restaurant when I travel by myself. Usually, the place to travel is where to travel for the first time. So I have no information about the price of food, what to wear, and whether it tastes good or not.

1442,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Success doesn't happen overnight, it takes lots of work and dedication. I believe that successful people are risk takers. In this paper I will emphasize my opinion with three points: to be successful, people need to make mistakes, to be successful people need to take risks, to be successful you people to explore and try new things. First successful people are not perfect, they learn from their mistakes. By making a mistake a person diminishes his experience. The person also opens his mind to new ways of doing things. Often when someone makes a mistake he tries not to replicate the mistake later on. Let's take as an example Alexander Graham Bell, when he invented the telephone, he made lots of different adjustments some work some didn't. Second, in order to make a mistake a person needs to be willing to take risks. If no risks are ever taken there is not a mistake that can occur. The same things happen over and over again. The person is in a cycle. Going back to our example, Mr. Bell was deaf, how could he have invented a telephone? Don't you need to hear to be able to speak through a telephone?

If the person was a young person, people would understand and say ""you did this because you are young.

For that reason adults have so much experience, it is easy to feel fear. When I was young my mother had a rice cake in her throat. Accordingly, she has not eaten any rice cake until now. Also she does not try to eat any rice cake even though it tastes so good. However, when she sees any kinds of rice cakes, she said it reminds her of the time. Consequently, to her it is really hard to try.

1460,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Whether young people enjoy life more than older people do or not draws a complex issue on the topic. Some people may say young people have a lot of fun, but the old do not. While others may oppose this opinion. If I have to choose a view, I will personally support the former claim. First of all, Young people have more opportunities to have fun from various aspects of society than old people do. People usually take it for granted that the conception of young means having fun, which is why our society provides more facilities for young people to do so. For example, the manufacturers produce various toys for babies, children, and even young adults. More over, many topics on TV concern the young, seldomly with the old. When I turn on my TV, I can find a lot of children's channels as interesting as Disney. In some countries, like China, there is only one child in a family. So both parents and grandparents will love her or him as precious as an apple, and provide her or him with all kinds of opportunities to have fun. Additionally, young people have a lot of energy and fewer responsibilities, which makes it easier for them to have fun. On the other hand, the old have to earn money in order to sustain the family. For instance, my father always looks tired after he comes home from his office and then he even refuses himself to have fun with me, which makes me very upset. As a wise man said (and I paraphrase ), "" Time is money, and time is treasure"". These words make those adults and olds think that they can not waste their time having fun at all, which might not be totally correct. Admittedly, our society provides old people with more and more opportunities and encourages them to have fun, especially when they get retired. After retiring, more and more old people feel bored and lonely at home. So they try to make more and more opportunities for themselves to have fun. The city government usually organize Senior Clubs which includes gym facilities, dance center, and so on. Even don't mention the chess clubs, singing clubs,. etc.","['Whether young people enjoy life more than older people do or not draws a complex issue on the topic.

First of all,every body agrees that successful people are not ordinary people. Because they've found a way to get richness and success while others are still stay poor in either their money or their futures. Successful people usually think differently. For instance,an average person who makes about 50 thousand dollars a year would probably save 10 to 20 thousand dollars in their bank accounts. What a successful person would do is use the money to invest other than put that much money into a bank. That's how a small amount of money gets larger and larger. Successful people think things in advance. They look at the market and they will know what hot deals are going on. They would find out which you can and which you cannot do. They would figure out which worthes the risk to invest in. In other words ,they have the intelligence to distinguish good stuff from bad stuff. Any way,successful people are usually businessmen.

There is another reason why there will be fewer cars on the roads that is the lack of oil reserves in the world. when you think that 99 percent of vehicles use oil for the energy they need this might sound more predictable unless the man kind finds another source of energy like sun or a kind of an element which can be used instead of oil."", 'It does not make much sense to say this because the scientists spend more time finding other means of transportation than finding useful elements or sources of energy to do the work which oil does today.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
1469,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I disagree with this statement. I am only a high school student so I'm not really sure about how elderly people feel. But I'll state three reasons which I'm sure about. They are; we are all the same human beings, generation really doesn't matter, all people feel joy at different times. The first reason why I disagree is because, we are all the same human beings. It's true that the elderly as our grandparents lived in a difficult time such as the world wars. Eventhough I believe that they also had an enjoyable young age. For me, everything was fun when I was a little girl. watching ants in a line was even enjoyable. Therefore I'm not sure how our thoughts will change through when we get older, but'm I'm still sure that we won't forget. memories. The second reason is because, looking at my grandmother makes me feel the age doesn't matter to enjoy the events. She likes to go watching movies with friends and after coming back she always talks to me about how the movies were and what she did with her friends, with twinkling eyes. From these experiences I'm sure that she is enjoying her life as an elderly person. The last reason is because, I think that all people have different thoughts and feelings about the word enjoyment. I feel most of the things which made me feel happy were enjoyable. Even on the train watching other people sometimes makes me enjoyable.","[""I disagree with this statement.

1470,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The issue of whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts is commonly discussed in our society. In my opinion the students' knowledge is improved when they understand not only the facts but the underlying ideas and concepts. In this essay i will support my answer with specific reasons and examples. Facts are definitely the students' knowledge base. Before any consideration the students need to know what happened. So teachers need to explain the facts without any comment or personal opinion. At a second, facts are separated into ideas and concepts. Teachers should help students to understand what drove the fact and what consequences it had. In our society is really important not only to know what is happening but also to understand the ideas and motivation. A great example is 11/09. Everybody saw what happened on the twin towers. The real knowledge comes from the understanding of nature and the cause of the terrorist attack. Only in this way can students go directly to the problem and try to find a solution. In conclusion I completely agree that students should analyse problems by learning the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts that are behind the facts. Only in this way will students be able to find the correct solutions to the problems that they will occur into.","[""The issue of whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts is commonly discussed in our society.

In particular, some people think young people don't give enough time to helping their communities, so they look down on young people. However, I think the young generation spend enough time on their communities and they shouldn't spend more time helping communities. Because there's a major volunteering class ( in school), young people have numerous things to do without helping communities and young people's time is for dreaming. First of all, there're a lot of programs to make young people help communities, and almost all young people do it. For example, almost all schools force students to spend time helping communities in Korea. The required volunteer time is high, and connected with the grade. In that way, young people do help their communities. I think it is hard work for young people, and they have done well until now. Second, we should understand that the younger generation has numerous things to do and they want. When I think of the young generation from junior-highschool students to 30's, it's easy to guess that they are really busy. School, company, friends, family. Their heads are already full of things to concern them. In my case, I'm 21 years old, there're lots of things to do at my school and house. It involves homework, studying, housework. Actually, I couldn't breathe easily. There's no time to think about something unimportant.

There are two reasons and examples why I agree with this statement. If you have knowledge of general information, it would be useful in your life. For example, if you work in an office and your boss asks you to write a report, your knowledge would help you. Because you have different kinds of knowledge, you can think from different views. If you only have specific knowledge, you can only focus on one view which would make your report pretty poor. Knowing about many different things would help you at school as well. For example, because you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, it would be useful in many situations, such as the examination and the interview. At the examination, you will surely get good grades because you have a lot of different knowledge, even though it does not specialize in one specific subject. Also at the interview, because you have different types of knowledge, you can answer the questions widely and you can appeal to how you understand general today's events and your cleverness as well.

1489,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Yong people are the future of a nation and the motor of its growth and fulfillment. They have always represented the symbol of energy and hope. Nowadays,young people have to carry a big responsibility from elementary school to achieve their dreams. Since they have many concerns in life,they tend to give shorter time to help their community. I think that this matter is due to the interaction of many factors. The first major factor,is the school's busy schedule. This limits the time given for young people to do community work so they can't be very efficient since they do not have sufficienttime. The second matter, is the increasing number of video games and entertainment that encourages young people to isolate themselves in their rooms and spend hours with technological machines rather than integrate into a club or a volunteering association. This behavior leads to a vicious circle because the more these young people hide behind their computer screens and games the more they split from society and the community actions and the more they will be aware of the importance of community help.","[""Yong people are the future of a nation and the motor of its growth and fulfillment.

As we can see from the reasons, to decrease the consumption of fuel, there is no need to curb the use of cars instead we can try and invent new means of fuel for ignition, for instance people have already started using cooking gas as fuel, but it is agreed that it is too dangerous as a small spark can ignite the whole vehicle, so research has to be conducted to develop. and the ease of availability of cooking gas is also specious, but there is definitely an alternate way to produce fuel Another reason for the decrease might be that maintaining a car might become too expensive, as the number of cars increased the consumption of fuel increased too, this led to a decrease in the availability of fuel or over all depletion of the fuel in the world, this will lead to increased fuel costs.

Secondly, older people have money and time to enjoy life. young people need money and their pocket money is not enough for some activities. however, when a person has a job and he is paid well, he can do what he wants in his holidays and free time. for example, even if two people enjoy reading books, one who is younger can't buy a book that he wants, the other can buy all of the books the writer has written. also, younger people can't find free time to do it. for instance, i like watching films and i know it is a simple activity. however i can't do it everytime because my school is very hard. also i live in a big city and i don't have a car so my time is spent on the buses.","[""many people have a different point of view about the idea of enjoying life. some think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. in contrast to this some think that older people have become knowledgeable about life and so they can enjoy it more than young people. i personally agree with the second idea because i think that young people have more important problems than old people, so they can't enjoy life as much as old people.

In my opinion, i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons why i agree are as follows. First of all, advertisements become more creative and interesting, owing to attracting more buyers to buy their products. If the advertisements are really boring, there is no one who will be persuaded to buy their products. What's more, there are lots of products in the world. Some sellers suffer more pressure about how to get an important role in this market, As a consequence, the advertisements will show more information about such good products they sell. Even though, the products are really not as good as the advertisements present them to be. Worst of all, it's a negative cycle. Lots of advertisements follow this kind of trend to gain more profits from consumers. By way of conclusion, i totally agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In order to attract more buyers and then earn more money, the advertisements make products which become more amazing and creative, but they really are not. It is a really negative cycle in our society. However, many people don't pay much attention to this issue. What a pity it is.","[""As is known to everyone, there are lots of advertisements that have been created during this medium period. some people think advertisements make products seem the same as they really are. on the other hand, some people don't think so.

But these young people dont have such types of problems. And some more reasons for this are health problems. Young people are more active than older people or not.

To begin with, if people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, it will be easier for them to find jobs.

So everybody's opinion as a young or older person could be affected by such an influence. Thus I am trying not to be affected by such group thinking.

And I am convinced the relatively short time young people party cannot be compared to the long periods the older people sit around watching tv, playing poker, or spending their free time in female chatting clubs.

1526,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"There are some differences between young people and older people. I want to explain important points about their characteristics.

Second, think about older people who are calmer and have knowledge, and go done with their development. They can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school. They may have time to think about their grand children who they got. But there are things that they can not do which is going to school, playing sports beyond their average , being expert at some new thing. So some limits come up to them because their age is increasing. But it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do. For example, if you want to have your own time to relax, sleep, talk with friends, it seems like young people have time for those kinds of things, but young people may not do it because there are a lot of things to do like home work, sports club, planning for university or job. But older people may do it because they have time, maybe they are having a job that they really want to do.

But I can answer based on what I have lived through this time and on what I have seen around me during this time. And I will say that I agree. There are a lot of advantages to getting older. Older people have more freedom (they can do whatever they want to and do not have to ask anyone), they earn their living on their own so they are able to plan better than young people because they do not have to rely on their parents. But I am still thinking that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are just many more things to do, things to enjoy, for young people. They do not have as many responsibilities as older people, so they do not have as many things to worry about. For example, I said that older people have more freedom, earning their own living. It is true. But what I did not say then, is that there is more fun, to me, in enjoying life basically, without any trouble in mind, or much less important ones. Furthermore, young people often have many more possibilities to meet new people and make new friends than older ones. Older people have to have a job to earn their living.","['I am happy.

1533,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In this era, where it is possible to underline an increase in production, most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are. This is a result of a great number of products that the owner of the companies has to sell to the consumers. For this reason i agree with that statement. I think that ,in this period, everyone who has to sell anything wants to show it in a better way than it really is. It is possible to find products that have a very low price but at the same time they are probably not very good items. Now where the Internet has increased its importance in selling products, all people try to show them in a fantastic state with beautiful pictures and one very accurate description. For example one year ago I bought a support for a mobile phone for the car. When it arrived at home I observed it and I noted that it was not as good as on the computer. The material that it was made of was very very bad and an optional item, that I bought with the support, didn't arrive at home. It' s possible to find a lot of advertisements on television that show all the items in a very beautiful way and I think that anyone has to pay attention before buying a particular product. I think it is better to buy items of a brand that is known. In this way you are sure to buy a good item if its price can be expensive. The most important brands have a great experience of working and they use all kinds of machines or material they need. In this capitalistic era infact there are many people that open an industry to sellingproducts. To have very low costs they use a material that is not good. This occurs for example in China where the prices of the products are very cheap. I had a lot of experiences with buying a product that were not good as they were shown, for this reason I suggest buying a very famous product! !.","[""In this era, where it is possible to underline an increase in production, most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are.

1534,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements have been increasing a lot during the last 30 years. Does it work or is it just an illusion ? Knowing how much money companies are willing to spend in an advertisement I have to say it must work. Now there are some more reasonable ways of responding to the question. We could talk about packaging forinstance. Between products that offer the same thing, that are at the same price, I would rather choose the best looking one. For me the product aspect reflects its real quality. In this case the true problem is comparison. I don't think you make a product seem better than it really is, the point is making the product seem better than the other products ! I think this is really working. There is another way of advertising a product : getting the buyer to know the product before he even gets to buy it : advertising in magazines and  on television. In my opinion, this may be more efficient because the buyer won't necessarily compare the product to the other ones. He will just get in the store and search for that exact product because he has been told it is the best. In this case it is true that advertising is used to make the product seem better than it really is.","[""Advertisements have been increasing a lot during the last 30 years.

1546,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Towards the statement that ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"", I would say that I agree with this statement. There are several reasons to support my belief. Firstly, specializing in only one specific subject would make a person become abstract. Concentrating on training students in one specific subject may have a harmful effect on children's development. If children receive specialized training in their studies, it may be too early for them to decide what to learn for their future. A student may choose to study biology in Grade 7, for example, because he likes animals. When he grows up, he may find that the subject is completely different from what he expects and it will be too late for him to switch to another subject. Career prospects are the second issue that I consider. Though having deep knowledge in one specific subject would let people become experts, society only requires a small portion of such kinds of experts, where college professors are the examples. Instead, having a variety of academic knowledge provides people with diverse potential job positions to select from. For example, a person who studies history may only be able to work in a museum.","['Towards the statement that ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"", I would say that I agree with this statement.

1548,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Nowadays, many people can see lots of advertisements. that is very effective for people. so, making an advertisement is very important for the company.

For example, I remembered that one company makes an advertisement for a hair shampoo. In the TV, the advertisement introduced that when I use the shampoo, my hair changes to silk. that's a lie and exaggeration. but the company sold lots of them. Second, if they tell only facts about a product in advertisements, no one will buy the product. If I were an advertisement maker, I would not tell only facts. In fact, many companies try to show more better than to show more factually. It's of course  true. Third, no one intervenes in their advertisement idea hardly. many advertisements make products much better.

The car has become an integral part of human life. so,i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"". Cars nowadays are more important than we think. In most of the developed countries, people prefer a car as transport rather than other conventional transportation modes, like trains,buses etc. Therefore, they can say that the car has become a vital part of their day to day life. Cars may cause many environmental problems,but that can be avoided by using pollution free fuels. For example, we know that many car companies are developing new fuels that will not harm the atmosphere,like hydrogen fuel which in turn leaves water as a waste product rather than harmfulgases. Many economies in the world depend on the manufacturing sector where the car industry is one of the important ones to generate money forcountries. There may be different kinds of transportation modes after two years, but there will be cars which are more sophisticated and may not use conventional fuels Car industry has not spread its wings greatly in some countries which are developing now. For example, take India. The Indian economy has risen before. so, there is untapped potential in different industries. One of the markets in India is cars. Many top companies are entering India to tap the vast market. For India, there is also an opportunity to generate new jobs in that market. To cater for cars from countries like China and India, it will take many years. Infact we may see a larger number of cars than today.

1564,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people. Enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people of all ages. There are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other, all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurrence. Both younger people as well as older people have problems to face in life. Each age group's enjoyment is curbed because of these problems, but the enjoyment is never far away. Lets take the example of a young boy. He does not enjoy it when he has to give exams, study, or go to school. However, he enjoys it when he goes to play, or when he watches television. In the same way an adult (middle aged) does not enjoy going to work, or working around his or her house. But they do enjoy it when they come back from work, when they are on a holiday, or when they go to a party. In the case of old people as well, they enjoy it as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds. But they face problems regarding their health. So this way every age group has its own share of enjoyment and problems. We cannot draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or less as there are various factors such as time and society which decide that. Along with this there is also the fact that one's enjoyment can be another's problem. In contrast, children enjoy playing more and studying less. The adults (parents) have problems with that, which curbs their enjoyment of seeing their child study. When the child is forcefully made to study, then the parents' enjoyment becomes the child's problem. In the case of old people, their enjoyment is that they do not need to work.","[""I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people.

1565,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people. Enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people of all ages. There are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other, all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurrence. Both younger people as well as older people have problems to face in life. Each age group's enjoyment is curbed because of these problems, but the enjoyment is never far away. Lets take the example of a young boy. He does not enjoy it when he has to give exams, study, or go to school. However, he enjoys it when he goes to play, or when he watches television. In the same way an adult (middle aged) does not enjoy going to work, or working around his or her house. But they do enjoy it when they come back from work, when they are on a holiday, or when they go to a party. In the case of old people as well, they enjoy it as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds. But they face problems regarding their health.

But this is a problem for adults ( middle-aged) as they become a burden on them. Due to this, old people are sent to shelter homes where it is a problem for them, but enjoyment for the adults.","[""I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people.

1566,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In the case of Latin America I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of different subjets because you can manage more activities and realize multi-task jobs. In my own experience, to find a job the recruiters ask you not for specific knowledge in a specific field. They ask you more about the knowledge in different areas that can help you to solve problems. In addition, when I was working I learned about different subjects because my job demanded it. For example, I am Electrical Engineering so I have a background in electronics and technical aspects, my last work was Project Management so I learned about Risk in the projects, financial stuff, logistics, management of human resources. I have a friend, His profession is architect and he reads a lot about different subjects because he is trying to apply mathematics, psychology, and marketing to the decoration of a room. He analizes the psychological profile of his clients and tries to design according to their interests and hobbies. People who have broader knowledge can manage more tasks and can do jobs that others do not know. Its easier to explain how to make something to a person who has knowledge in more fields. On the other hand, some activities require specialized resources for example people who repair, and build airplanes. Those works need specialized knowledge, but need more years of specialization in a field. In conclusion, I'm agree with the statement because for society its better to have people with knowledge of different branches.","['In the case of Latin America I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of different subjets because you can manage more activities and realize multi-task jobs.

Japanese companies extend not only inside of Japan, but also worldwide. Toyota, Matsuda and Mitsubishi are companies producing a great number of cars all over the world. If there is no need to produce present numbers of cars, these companies will be in serious trouble with the business function of my country. As a way to maintain the present economy, the Japanese government will cooperate with companies. So people continue to buy cars for a long while. Nowadays, I saw great news on the television screen.

It is impossible to walk to the station, if it is located far from one's house. I do not think that this situation and demand will change in twenty years, which is too early. In my country, Japan, the car industry is really huge to support our economy. Japanese people are commonly said to be good at making electrical products including cars. Japanese companies extend not only inside of Japan, but also worldwide. Toyota, Matsuda and Mitsubishi are companies producing a great number of cars all over the world. If there is no need to produce present numbers of cars, these companies will be in serious trouble with the business function of my country. As a way to maintain the present economy, the Japanese government will cooperate with companies. So people continue to buy cars for a long while.

1581,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"""Don't judge the book by its cover"" is a common saying in English to send a signal to people that they should not be deceived by whatever they see. However, it is not always true because there are other factors that could be borne in mind before approaching such a behavior by a lot of companies. As far as I am concerned , I disagree with the written statement for some economic and moral reasons. Economically speaking, it is true that all companies nowadays think of profits, but they do concern themselves with the satisfaction of the customer. These companies should take into consideration that if they got a customer from a customer, there is a possibility of losing a lot of customers. Especially in countries where customers have the right to complain about the low quality of product. A s a result , the company would lose a lot of money because other people would be encouraged to do so due to incoherent information being exposed in some advertisements. Therefore, companies should think about how much money that they might lose for such stupid behavior. They have already put a lot of money on the advertisement and they are not ready to lose more.

My instant reply is no, and mainly because I realize how our technology is rapidly advancing, and cars will change, changing only to make people love them more, satisfying urges for beautiful car models, creating more desires to own one. Looking back into the past since cars were first invented, there's a huge big difference in how much cars are owned. Compared to before when only the rich ownedcars, cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price, considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one. As time passes, the rich will continue to buy more cars and sell their old ones, and at the same time, the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price. With this cycle going on, more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them. And why are the rich buying more and more cars? Generally it's because of the constant change in car technology; the desire for speed and unique designs. A stereotype view of rich people is people who buy cars just because of their looks. Car companies looking at this, will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed cars. There's a rare chance rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these cars will decrease.","[""Will there be fewer cars in twenty years from now?

For instance, they would like to spend two hours or more reading books in the library or seeing videos and playing computer games at home instead of helping their communities which may gain them nothing in the near future. Furthermore, most young people nowadays are not aware of the idea of a ""community"" anymore. The identity of being part of the community is getting weaker and weaker. Some of them even don't notice about their living in a community. For example, apartments and houses have become the main style of buildings nowadays. Young people leave their houses in the early morning and come back to the very same place late at night. How can we expect them to know each other from their neighborhoods? This kind of lifestyle weakens young people's identity of community. Naturally, they will not pay attention to a society which they are unfamiliar with. Finally, considering this so-called efficient society, tasks relating to communities are almost done by certain workers or employees of these communities. In this way, a community becomes an epitome of a factory. Everyone has his own job and only does what he or she is asked to do. Take my family's community as a real example. We hired four people to do every task in our community.","['I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Introduction: 1. know the subject. 2. opportunities are there. 3. dont waste time. The first reason is if a student takes learning one subject it will be easy to get the score. for example if a student takes a course in a computer subject like this it can have different subjectsthere. If the student chooses the subject of the java course. The student can concentrate on that subject. so he can get a good score. Suppose if the job is not get he can teach the subject to other students and he can get the salary. This is another way of doing it if he can't get the job. The second reason is to create a new project if the student takes on one subject if we take the above example java course. The student can create new things like if in the based on the java course he can create web sites and quick transactions. If a student goes this way he can get better opportunities and the student gets the better salary and he can have a bright future. If the student can create a new project he can give a presentation on that thing. If the government produces in the market and people are used to that project. The third reason is that it does nt waste time the student can learn on that subject and he can not waste the time.,"[""I agree that specializing in one subject is better.

For example, oldies cannot ride a ski or snowboard as young people do dangerous tricks because they have more risk than young riders have. The second reason is related to passion. Young people usually have more passion than old people do. For this reason, it is because of hormones and the different amount of experience. Old people have less hormones than young people have and hormones are one of the scientific catalysts that make the brain excited. As a result of this, even if young and old people do the same situation, their excitement is different because of the amount of hormones. For passionate people, the amount of experience also affects a lot. Usually a beginner has more excitement than a veteran does. For example, when two different types of people have the same girl friend, the amount of excitement is different between a lady and a guy who never had a girlfriend because a lady's guy already has experience of having a girl friend.

People nowadays realize that air pollution is getting worse and worse because of cars.

Instead, they will start choosing public transportation, such as MRT, tram, and bus, to get to the place they need to go. Moreover, the payment for a car is not cheap at all. For example, when you get a car, you have to pay for the oil and maintenance. I dare to say it will cost you more money than spending money on taking public transportation. Second, oil is becoming less and less though scientists have done their best to dig oil and find where oil can be. Oil is one kind of natural resource and the formation of oil must be very long, so it is not limitless. However, oil is essential for cars. Without it, people can not start cars at all; then, people will reduce using cars step by step. I think that the above I wrote can explain why there will be fewer cars than today. Just remember that the quantity of oil is limited and one day it will be gone,and the government have spent lots of money on establishing public transportation. Where does the government get the money to create public facilities? It is from people who pay taxes.

1621,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In most cases academic education provides the possibility of a profound and distinct understanding of a certain subject in Germany. As a basis you have to take several subjects in the beginning and this leads after approximately a year to specialization into one subject. A broader knowledge of more academic subjects could have some advantages regarding more flexible and different approaches to solve a problem. However, this leads to a lack of specific details on evaluating complex problems. One might argue that with a greater diversity of subjects there will be more solutions and the person can go into detail if it is required. But this often requires a lot of time and usually companies are not willing to invest more money and additional time in educating their employees. Hence, specialization if chosen in a smart way can give the applicant for example a significant advantage. On the other hand it has to be ensured that cultural understanding and logical thinking trained by mathematical education has been provided. Therefore, schools that host students in Germany for 12 to 13 years are responsible. Education needs a lot of time implying that further unspecialized subjects are being taught at the universities it even takes longer for a student to be prepared forworking autonomously. According to the benefit of society and a person who accomplishes their studies in a shorter amount of time the conclusion I'm drawing is to ensure broad knowledge in schools and in the first year of university but then quickly turn into specific subjects.

1622,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Usually, people are familiar with what they used to do. Some people fear new things because they are not sure about them, or because they cannot take risks even if this action could open new doors for them toward a good future. I believe that a person should take this risk sometimes and try new things in his or her life because I think that the ability of our minds is unlimited. Therefore, I completely agree with the opinion that says people who try new things are able to be more successful. In our life, getting risk is a fundamental part of our world. No one can expect what could happen to him or her. So, I think it is worth it to try new things, use new media, or meet new people. Many successful people built their successful on a moment that they were born. For example, the famous actor ""Arnold"", he can be just like any other actor , but he decided to engage in the political world and now, he is the governor of California State. I consider his decision to be a bold and smart decision because after a few years he would loosen his ability to be good and attractive actor because of his age.","['Usually, people are familiar with what they used to do.

1629,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to help my opinion. First, ideas and concepts are always the basis of everything when we make a new product or facts. If someone has only a fact, he/she can use that fact but they can't use proper usage of this fact. We can use our facts to know their ideas and concepts. when I was a child, my uncle gave me an airplane paper craft. I can throw it and it will be flying in the air. It was surely interesting and exciting for me but I couldn't understand why it could fly. It is a childish question but I was so serious. So, I learned to know ideas and concepts are so important at that time. In addition, some people feel annoying about facts if they didn't know ideas and concepts. One of my friends will be angry when he can't understand anything. We can say mathematics is also based on ideas and concepts.

First, ideas and concepts are always the basis of everything when we make a new product or facts. If someone has only a fact, he/she can use that fact but they can't use proper usage of this fact. We can use our facts to know their ideas and concepts. when I was a child, my uncle gave me an airplane paper craft. I can throw it and it will be flying in the air. It was surely interesting and exciting for me but I couldn't understand why it could fly. It is a childish question but I was so serious. So, I learned to know ideas and concepts are so important at that time. In addition, some people feel annoying about facts if they didn't know ideas and concepts. One of my friends will be angry when he can't understand anything. We can say mathematics is also based on ideas and concepts.

1646,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"According to me the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide. first of all, the best way to enjoy travelling is to go with an other person, It'sn't good to go with a group, because it's difficult to share your feelings and make a plan quickly and efficiently with many people together. For example if you need to shop you have to be worried about the feelings of your group, but it's easier when you travel with a friend or a member of your family to change the schedule of your journey. Secondly, all of your movements during the trip are restricted because you are in a group. For instance, if you have a plan to enjoy eating in a different restaurant, if you will meet many new people, it's not possible to do this in a group because during the trip you are always with your group, so you don't have the time to meet someone and the travel can be boring. Finally, if you travel with a guide you are not able to quit the group and to do what you want to do. You have to follow the instruction of the tour guide it's like travel information that's not good. For example if you go to some country in Africa like Ivory Coast, all the tourists like to go to yamoussokro to see the biggest catholic church in the world, the tourists don't take the time to visit the capital which contains some interesting stuff too. In conclusion the best way to travel is with a partner like a friend or a member of your family it's more fun. On the other hand, that depends on what you are planning to do and what's your purpose is. For instance if you want to travel for a history class or whatever. I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.","[""According to me the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide. first of all, the best way to enjoy travelling is to go with an other person, It'sn't good to go with a group, because it's difficult to share your feelings and make a plan quickly and efficiently with many people together.

1647,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Nowadays, there are many people who believe that only doing what they already know how to do well is true. Nevertheless, I absolutely disagree with this point completely. I think that successful people try things and take risks to become successful. There are many successful people who also take many high risks before they / become successful and well-known. Bill Gates is a typical example in this situation. When Bill Gates was still a student at university, he realized that he would be a great man and hired by a big company with a great amount and stable salary after he graduated.","['Nowadays, there are many people who believe that only doing what they already know how to do well is true.

1648,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially ordinary people, often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I strongly believe that Most honored people like to do something new. Most successful people are curious. they always think about what people are not interested in. as people know, the chief of Sony company is the best example. when he was young, he thought he listened to the radio not only staying at home, but only walking down the street. So, finally he made a Sony walkman. he became a known person and a successful person. They also have a dream themselves and they do what they try to do new things. they were embarrassed. and if they decide something, they never give up. Of course, none of them are like that.","['People, especially ordinary people, often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

1649,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people believe that the products in advertisements are the same as the real ones because they look like the real ones. However, I do not agree with it. I believe most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of well-taken pictures and the strategy of companies. First of all, well-taken pictures are very attractive. The purpose of advertising is to show the products well to people. For performing that purpose, the products in advertisements should be in good shape. A friend of mine, he works in an advertisement company in Korea. One day, he showed me two pictures of apples. One was just a regular picture and the other one was a picture that he added some color balance with photoshop. Two pictures were totally different from each other, and he said that his company would use the latter picture for the apple advertisement. For this reason, I believe that the goods in advertisements are in better shape than the real ones. Moreover, advertising should make people want the products, and that is the strategy of advertisements. For letting people buy the goods, the advertisements have to use any way to attract people even if they exaggerate. One day, I saw the advertisements for Kim-chi, Korean traditional food, on television shopping.","['Some people believe that the products in advertisements are the same as the real ones because they look like the real ones.

1650,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I am completely positive about the statement. Here i would like to mention some reasons why group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so i guess i confirm the advantages of group travelling. First of all, tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. Group travelling people can defend themselves in difficult times and it is more likely to attract public attention for requesting help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of the high velocity rate. The second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel costs. Needless to say, it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists, not only discounts, but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or a certain number of members. The third reason serves our company's main goal, More people, more fun. It is very interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches and other attractive entertainment. Travelling is not only the meaning of travelling, but of making friends and getting relationships with them. It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way. I know of many occasions when tourists get married after a long, exciting tour.","[""I am completely positive about the statement.
