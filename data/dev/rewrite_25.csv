1046120.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The car is the best instrument for our convenient life. Most people buy their own car if they can afford it. However, in the future that is portrayed as more speedy and comfortable than nowadays in some movies, we may discard our cars and the cars will be just a huge waste of time. There are some reasons to explain this opinion. These days are changing and developing faster than in thepast. Some people have already visited out of earth, and lots of satellites are being thrown on the earth. Instead of using cars, they will move away by their personal flying like a plane or themselves. From the past, many people have wanted to fly to the sky and they finally made an airplane. The more wishes make more developments.

323858.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.",From my point of view it is right.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"From my point of view, this statement is correct."
1500557.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travel with a tour guide Many people travel to another country to learn or to see other cultures. in order to do that people should have some i nformation about the countries they are going to too. Then they can know more about the country or the place they are planning to go to. there are many ways to do that. For example reading books or asking some friends or going to atravel agency to help them or to advise them to place that they shouldgo to. i think the best way of having more information and knowledge is to have a tour guide that can help the travelers and make them have fun. I think that is a good way to get more information and make the travelers not miss the best places that people should visit. I think that it is more effective and helpful because, having a tour guide and he or she is usually from the place that the traveler is heading too. The tour guide will provide a lot of information and advice to the traveler much then asking a friend. For example he or she will have the best to teach or inflounce the traveler. In addition, some times the tour guide will teach the traveler the country's culture and language or slang that the travel agency can not do. That will make them have more information known and information about the people who live in this country. Also, it will make it easy for the traveler to ask them about the culture. Because usually travelers have a lot of questions that they need to know now about the culture that they are going to and it is not easy for them to ask someone who lives there. Also the tour guide can introduce the people or the traveler to the cultural food or the best places to go or the best hotels or cities because they will much know about it.","For example, last year i went with my family to Hong Kong, China which is the biggest city in the east corner of China.",0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, last year I went with my family to Hong Kong, which is the biggest city in the east corner of China, and our tour guide made the trip much more enjoyable and informative."

572315.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It's a very interesting topic to write on. Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price. He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price.","Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets success and another takes a regular film which is a flop,who again takes the risk of talking about another variety film, definitely the successful one.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Take another example

1928452.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially those who would like to make a success in their life, discuss whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just keep what they already have a knowledge to make a better life. I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life. For example, the SamSung company which is specialized in the electronic field such as TV, computers and semiconductor products worldwide has been researching new markets and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result, it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people. If the company still enjoyed stability, today's successful story would not exist. Further more, the companies which exploit the well of crude oil always try to find new resources by investing large amounts of money with huge risks. For these efforts, it deserved to get a lot of reputation and accumulate a fortune. Secondly, stability of today's life means returning to the past in this capitalism. Everyday, new information is revealed to the public and every individual must have a radar to catch it.","For example, the auto maker company tries to new design to meet the customers' needs in the market However, they do not make an effort to make a new design of cars, the company will lose the people's consumption.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, the auto maker company tries new designs to meet the customers' needs in the market.

823056.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Success comes by taking risks Trying new things certainly gives a very good idea about what all things one is good atdoing. This statement of mine confirms that I strongly agree with the fact that ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"". Its easy for one to just follow the routine of his life ,like what he learned inschool ,from his house ,from this professional and keep following it to lead a normal life with out attempting to try something new. This happens mostly because many of them are sacred of unsuccessfulness by which I mean people are not ready to take defeat. Such people don't believe in winning and losing is not important ,its just that how you play the game"". I personally agree that trying new things helps you to become successful because trying can help you to learn all the other capabilities in one self for example, somebody took a job of pizza delivery for some reason, for example, suddenly needingmoney , dropped out of college and while doing this job he learned that he knew so much about the city that he could try to be a tourist guide. In doing so there is a big risk involved in giving up a well earning job to somethingfairly new. But until he doesn't try it he may never in his life be able to do anything else except being a pizza delivery person. secondly ,It helps you to know how to deal with different situations at different points. If one fails in his first attempt ,he knows what precautions he need to take incase he tries to do the same thing next time.","One of the strong examples I would like to mention at this point is ""Gandhi"".",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"One of the strong examples I would like to mention at this point is Gandhi, who took significant risks to achieve his goals."
61450.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","These days, there are numerous problems which are related to cars, such as air pollution problems, traffic jams, or fuel problems. I strongly believe that these problems will be solved as the numbers of cars decrease in the next twenty years, with the changes in the government policy and developments of new technology. First, the government tries to make a policy to decrease the numbers of cars, as they face problems which are caused by cars. Governments encourage people to use public transportation rather than their own cars, and this will decrease the numbers of cars. For example, the Korean government already have a practical policy which makes people prefer public transportation. The government encourages people who use public transportation to take their taxes less. However, people who have their own cars should pay much more taxes, according to the new policy. As the new policy stated, many people try to use public transportation, and this decreases the number of private cars. Second, new technologies develop to substitute cars, such as monorails, private air crafts, and these equipments will be practical immediately. There have been many research efforts to create new transportation which is better than cars, and finally these days, these efforts are gaining their results. For example, many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in ordinary places, because air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars these days. About two years from now, they succeeded in the development, and according to some newspapers, it will be practical in ten years from then. In brief, cars are the main transportation equipment these days, but they will be decreased as the government policies change and new technologies develop.","Even though we can not think of our lives without cars these days, our children or grand children will think it's o.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Even though we cannot think of our lives without cars these days, our children or grandchildren will think it's normal to live without them."

987670.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I like to travel with my father more than by myself. I always travel in summer with my family. my father, mother, and younger sister usually go to different countries each year. Traveling with my father is much better for us because, he is the tour guide. First of all, travelling with a tour guide will make the trip short and easy, since the tour guide has experience in his place. He will make my vacation more enjoyable. The second reason is that, the tour guide will choose a good place for me better than I do. One time when I went to a new city I asked for a good place to go and how I could go there. At this point I lost the way. So it saves time going with a tour guide who will take me there in a short time. and i do not need to think of time.

236812.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society. From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects.","For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he might think it is unchangeable, which can lead to confusion."
1228978.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although some people believe that young people enjoy life more than old people do, I do not agree with this statement. However, from my point of view, I believe that enjoyment is not related any more to the age of people. So many reasons can support my point of view. In this life, there are many things that people can enjoy. These than are different from people to other. For example, children will enjoy playing computer games. but, when they become a little older they will enjoy other things like playing football. By the years, their way of entertainment will vary according to their ages. another reason that supports my opinion is the different circumstances for people. some people were sad during their youth and become happy when they are oled and vice versa for other people. this is because of the surrounding environment.","On the other hand, some people believe that young people enjoy life more than old people do.",0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"On the other hand, some people argue that young people enjoy life more than old people do, but I still believe that enjoyment is not related to age."
473771.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that both of these options are very important for a student. Of course, it depends on what is your field of study. For this reason I would say that I disagree with this statement. For example if you are studyinghistory, it is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of course this is also a very important knowledge that is required ofyou, as a historian , to have.","It is really very important, infact a student is studying for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what you are studying but I can't say that this is more important than learning facts, because without knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For this reason, it is really very important for a student to understand ideas and concepts of what they are studying.

484161.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Ideas and facts are really different things. Ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt. Because it is only an idea. But the fact is different. Facts must be done in real life. I think it is more important to learn facts than ideas. Because facts are real but ideas are not. You can learn so many ideas about something but you can't apply these ideas in real life. It is not important if you don't apply ideas in real life. But if you know facts you can apply them immediately when you hear ideas. But if you know only ideas you cant do anything in real life. For example an electronic engineer can know how television works. But he/she knows only the idea of how it works. I think this is not important. In real life people dont pay attention toideas. People pay attention to facts. Because facts are real and applicable. People want to see something. People dont want to hear only ideas. If they see facts then people pay attention toideas.

46344.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Others believe the best way to travel is on your own. Both opinions have their advantages and disadvantages actually. I agree with the second opinion. To me, traveling on your own is much better. First of all, when you travel on your own, you are free to go wherever you like. You can design your own tour according to your likings and interests. You can manage your time better. That will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the places you like better. Another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spending according to your budget. In a group, the places you will visit are determined by the tour guide, and unfortunately, you cannot change it. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide costs a certain amount of money, which probably would cost you less if you planned it yourself. You should follow the tour guide and go to the restaurants the guide determines as opposed to getting your own food. For example, my husband and I planned an ""interrail"" trip in Europe a couple of years ago. It was all on our own. We planned in advance where, when, how, for how long we would go. It was more fun to explore the places on our own since we had the chance to interact with local people in their regular daily life. We made friends too. As a result, I strongly support the idea of travelling on your own.","You have more freedom, you interact with people and you make friends.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"As a result, I strongly support the idea of travelling on your own because you have more freedom, you interact with people, and you make friends."

When I read this question, I was conflicted between agreeing or disagreeing because both are important to students. However, I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are a few specific reasons and examples to support my statement. First, ideas and concepts could be basic information of all theory or other  information. For example, facts are from the ideas and concepts. If there are not ideas and concepts, there also are not facts, all investigations have patterns or methods such a scientific method. First of all we think of ideas and concepts first.

I disagree with the given statement that ""in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"". In the olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking. the invention of the wheel changed the evolution greatly. after the invention of the wheel man introduced many new vehicles for transportation. he initially used bullock carts,tongas which were pulled by animals. In later life he introduced bicycles ,which served him well for travelling later he introduced motor cycles inorder to reach quickly with less effort,inthis process man thought of a luxurious way of travelling and he started to introduce vehicles running onfuel. he designed some of them for transportation of goods ,and some for humans,such as trucks and buses. And he later thought about the luxuries and privacy ,then brought the cars. cars were luxurious means of transportation in the early days. but it is compulsory now. this change has occurred because of globalisation and necessities. in the initial stages there were very fewcars ,people used to see it very intently. but nowadays in the developed countries many people have more than one car. The main problem with cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution. for this reason many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding more taxes  and parking fees.

Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them. In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures. A person has to love his work to create new things and to succeed indeed. By taking risks you learn new useful things that help you in your life.

Young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their youth and things that are available to young people. First, in my opinion, young means full of energy, especially in physical conditions. Most young people have the best or better body conditions than older people. These conditions make people able to do many things like studying, playing sports, drinking alcohol etc. For example, when sportsmen get old nearly 40, they usually retire because their physical conditions are not strong enough to continue that job. Moreover, when people get older, they keep on destroying their brain cells whether they want to or not. Thus, young people can enjoy their life more than older people do because they are mostly healthier than old people. Second, when people are young, there are so many opportunities for them. Limitation to older people on the rollercoaster can be a good example of that.

Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem.
