1237588.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"I agree whit the statement that successful peolple try to do new things and not only what they are already good to do.
In my opinion this is a main aspect of a successful person, indeed successful people have the ability to understand what they can try to do even if they know that they already haven't the preparation to do that.
Someone can't became a real successful person if he does't try to risk.
He has to have the ability to understand that he can try to do something even if he does't know how to do that.
In modern society it is more difficult to rase over other people than some years ago, so people, who want success, have to go over their own limits to try if they are really able to do some thing.
It is like when someone bet, he doesn't know if he will win, but he knows that if he will win he will be happy and successful.
Nowadays there isn't so much space for weak people in the high levels of the society.
But there is  a big problem about this aspect of successful people, and it is a proplem for all the society.
I think doing this, there is a low quality of activity.
In other words, if someone stop to do something when he becomes able to do that, because he wants to do something else, there won't be a person able to do that work and so there will be less quality.

First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they started the course. Because the facts is easily to understand and it is ineresting. But there are some disadvanage about learn facts. It hardly to catch the main ideas, students may only interesting on the stories, but didn't know the meanning.

In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content about this course. Although the facts can let them know how to use it on the society, it still limitied. However we can't refuse it can leads students get some experiences. It still not general for the students.

Finally, the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course. The facts concluding different type of knowledge. They are all useful. But the knowledge which are concetin about the course may lead students to the wrong way. They may try to take more focus on other course.

However, cars, as for me, will also exert an great impaction in human society in the future. And their number will not even decrease. On the contrary, the development of cars will be surprising and momentous.

Twenty years can be a long time or a short time, but the development of the quality of cars, including speed, security would be tremendously huge. People will definitely enjoy these obvious advantages in the thought of travelling more places in the world that has became smaller and smaller. And there are also other aspect in their development.

As you know, many institutes and countries have been doing researches to find a fuel that possess both efficiency and environmental benefits. Progress have been made in these researches. And fuels can replace the role of gasoline, whose quantity has been declining because of the explosion, have two main choices. First one, for me, is hydrogen, that can be fired and used for energy and can produce few substances that pollute the environment.  The next one is the usage of solar energy, a sort of energy that can be obtained from the sunlight using peculiar ways. 

After about twenty years, when these two kinds of energy can be used in cars, people would like to make a use of these cars under the thought to protect environment, and this thought, will be erected in ten years ascribed to the education that pay attention to the education in this area. 

Not only the improvement of the qualities of cars, but the usage of fuel leads me to believe that in twenty years, the number of cars will not decreased, but ascend in a large quantity due to both the improvement of the sence to protect public and natural environment and the usage of new fuel which will make cars the most effiencient and covenient means of transportation without polluting the environment.

But others think that travel with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfertable. And i'm one of them.
First of all, if you have a tour guide and a group of companiers, you will feel not very free. Travelling with a tour guide, the plan will be formerly ordered,somethings you want to see a other thing or want to go to another place will not be alloweded. You can't change the plan. But for me, the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like, but i can't change, because of the whole groud. That makes me feel very upset. And a large mount of people will have a large mount of oppinions. It's difficult to recognize the idea. And some people will not follow the rules. Once i joined a travelling group, but we have to wait for one or two people all the time after visiting some sceneries. I felt that's a waste of my time. 
Then, travelling with a group by a tour guide is always very busy, you can't visit one thing in a comfertable way, there's only limited time that you can stay in one place. The whole journey is in a quick pace that you can't enjoy it. And most of the tour guides will let you to some place whice they will get benifits from it. But this kind of place really wastes our life.

1630850.txt,P5,KOR,medium,"  There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years later surely.  Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to  many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jamming, environment pollution and lacking of oil. 

  First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jam on our roads is incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land are very densely populated,  there are excessive cars on the road, there happens the traffic jamming even on the highway road. Not only for Korea, it is the worldwide problem. Many country are suffering from traffic jam. government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jam.

  And one other problem as serious as above is the environmental thing. Car causes pollution in many ways, most seriously, the engine gas of cars make the sky foggy and dirty. It causes contagious eye diseases, and respiratory problems. In adittion, it promotes the global warming which is making mankind very afraid of. The carbon dioxide in the engine gas make the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth. And then the water level uprises and covers available land of us. Maybe we lose our whole earth to live. If cars won't decrease, there will happen a crisis of the entire human race.

  Moreover, the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now, and in about  40 years, there will be no oil to depend on. in present point of view, we can't live without oil and gas. They are used to make fabrics, circulating plants and factories, and more and more. If we use all of them driving car,  the thing will happen a lot sooner. So till we have a great resource to replace oil and gas, we should try to save it and invent other kind of transportions which are not taking any oil.

 In the points of view above, there are too many problms with abundance of cars. So for people to live, in the global view, they will not have cars. Ultimately we will be able to see not jamming roads and clearer sky with fewer cars in the road.

We will see in which way this affirmation is true or false.

When people try new things, it is clear that they are showing their ability to create, to manage and to anticipate. If they took the right innovative decision, that-is-to say what they decided make them earn money for instance, they are going to be seen as succesful people. On the contrary, if they made up their mind in the wrong way, they are going to be blamed for, especially because they did not take the usual way.

There are lot of people in this whole world who are effectively doing research on a particular topic of their interest and therefore are expected to give productive out comes because they are very much focused.They have enough time and energy to concentrate on a particular aspect of a research
also it is a very old saying that little knowledge is a dangerous thing and as we know that our brain has only some limited capacity so we cannot afford to have profoud knowledge of each and every subject and therefore this will only result in frustration .Also incomplete knowledge can proved to be dangerous and misguiding also.For example if a chemistry student tries to teach physics then he surely be less effective in explaining every point because he has only limited knowledge of the subject, this will be harmful for the students he is addresing and this is quite possible that something wrong can be construed from his teachings .Similarly a chemist cannot perform a physics experiment or vice versa and this can result in even accidents
Moreover if we assume that every person know everything about every subject then this will result in decrease in interaction among people and advancements in any field will be halted because we know more the number of brains working together ,more better is the outcome of the result
So in my view it is always beneficial to go more deep in a particular subject rather than having a superficial knowledge of all subjects because in that way an individual can benefit the society in a more effective manner and this is also neccesory por the satisfection of the individual that he is master of atleast something.

236812.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"    In our  modern society with globle economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desire of the society. From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea  that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
    To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts makes students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just know the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is beacase he does not know about the realities. If he already has learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into puzzle.
    In addition, students always get more interests in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts.
    Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt the society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already known the facts. Besides, students also can use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas.
    In summary, it is obvious that ideas and concepts are much more important for student to learn than just understand for the reason of the clearity of the reality, student's interests on the subject and the benefits for their future. Therefore, it is strongly recommanded that students should learn facts from the ideas and concepts. It is very good for their mental healthy.

1829333.txt,P5,DEU,medium,"I do not agree with the statement that in twenty years fewer cars will be in use than there are today, because of the importance of cars as a means of transportation.

In a globalized world cars have very much influence on our whole life.
They are an important means of transportation in trade as well as a means of a flexible lifestyle.
Without cars the exchange of goods in a globalized world would be much more complicated. 
Also the exchange of people, in the sense of employees and workers, would be much more difficulty. Many people depend on their car to reach work. For example people who are working in Frankfurt or other big cities are often forced to drive many hours to their place of work, because they can not afford appartments in the cities to life in. Without a car they would be forced to move houses or to find work next to their home, which is in many cases because of the high unemployment not possible.

Without a car people would not be flexible any longer. They would be forced to take the bus or the train, which are often overcrowded, late and in the case of train in Germanz very expansive.

The limitation of cars would have a deep impact on the whole society. If there would be less cars it would be necessary to replace them by other sources of transportation, like trains or busses. Today many cities lack the financial capacities to finance such a big project.


Because cars vary in their prices and are therefore also accesible for people with a smaller amount, many people will keep buying them in the future. 

To come to a conclusion I would say that today cars are an important means of transportation as well as a status symbole, and will therefore increase in the future.


","I do not agree with the statement that in twenty years fewer cars will be in use than there are today, because of the importance of cars as a means of transportation. In a globalized world cars have a very big influence on our whole life. They are an important means of transportation in trade as well as a means of a flexible lifestyle. Without cars the exchange of goods in a globalized world would be much more complicated. Also the exchange of people, in the sense of employees and workers, would be much more difficult. Many people depend on their car to get to work. For example people who are working in Frankfurt or other big cities are often forced to drive many hours to their place of work, because they can not afford apartments in the cities to livein. Without a car they would be forced to move houses or to find work next to their home, which is in many cases because of the high unemployment. Without a car people would not be flexible any longer.

For this to achieve there are no secret formulas, there are no new things to try, nothing like that, but doing what must be done, and what has been done since the early years of this sport, working for it. Also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind ""if it is working and giving you results do not change or try something new"", so succesful tennis players do not take great risks, nor try new thing, they just do what they know they do best, and stick to it if it is working. 

So this makes me think things should work like this in every other subject, if something is giving you succes, why changing it? Maybe if you are just in search of that ""success"" in other subjects rather than sports you should try new things, for example in pizzas, we have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Peter Piper Pizza, etc... so maybe thinking in subjects like this it is hard getting success following the same steps others did long ago, beacuse of all the competition, maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so compited subject, so maybe here it is when you will have to try new things, explore new markets etc.. but if you find success with something don't try to change it, as long as it is giving you what you look for keep doing the same, or if you something well, no matter there is a lot of competition, keep doing it, because if you really do your thing well, people will notice about it and results will arrive sooner or later.

Also, one of the main points is the improvement of the technology. Maybe it can be thought that because of the polution or the non pollutions plans that the governments are trying to impulse in some years most of the people will change their cars for the public transport. Because of that the car companies are investing money in evolute new green technologies like hidrogen batteries that will make possible to use a car without polutting, in fact you will creat just water instead of dioxide carbon that is really harmfull for our enviroment.

In deed, that improvement of the technology will make cheaper all the proces of making a car, so there will be more people who will be able to obtain a car when before that improvement they couldn't.

Successful  people knows that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up them. They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what that the world needs so they can do it. Although many people think successful people are selfish, just do things they like or they want, won't share with others, but I think it is only other people don't understand what they are thinking. THey have a different thought  than others so they success, they won't just stop where they success. They want more success, everyone wants more success but not everyone can do it, so they know they can do it they won't care about the risk, even the risk is big but if they can pass it they success.

Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve. Successful people know that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up with them. They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what the world needs so they can do it. Although many people think successful people are selfish, just doing things they like or they want, they won't share with others, but I think it is only other people who don't understand what they are thinking. THey have a different thought than others so they succeed , they won't just stop where they succeed. They want more success, everyone wants more success but not everyone can do it, so they know they can do it they won't care about the risk, even if the risk is big but if they can pass it they succeed. They fail, they keep on going to find another thing. In conclusion, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. "
1569573.txt,P7,KOR,medium,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination.
of couse every ideas can be based by facts. but sometimes  it's worng because students have to try to think creat things 
someyears ago. many school forced students to study with fomula and memorize only fact . they didn't allow students to speak their opinons freely. but these day , many systems have changed in school. they ecourages students creative activity.
when the childhood is important to student 
they don't know well about the society and future and around many things . the free thinking can be helpful in our society. these thinking can produce more advaced future.
just to learn the facts and memorizes block them from free thinking
and  the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can.

for example , i read the book a few days ago 
after reading the book i agreed with it.
the book include about fomula education.
the childeren learn mathmathics in school they have to solve the problem  but they can't count the number well.
when they learned mathmathics they were foced to remeber the formula and they  always studied  almost same questions. 
sometimes they faced higer problems but also they depended on the fomula. so, oneday their homeroom teacher asked them 
""which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2?"" children answered ""1/4""
they knew only bigger number. they couldn't think about the amout and range and degree.
so i suggest that they shoud be learnd with  new way 
like experiments and expression their think ,even if  it's worng.

another one is about the art.
art include alot of things . such as drawing and taking a picture and acting so on.
i want to say about the acting 
actor or actress don't know how to act and speak before getting the paper with their role. they have to act  depend on themselves. and 
have to imagine and understand the situation. 
the fact out the situation is not enough to make a movie
audience expect to see the scenery which they can't do and can't think. so the filmmakers have to satisfy such the people. 

in conclusion, i think it is better to understand  and concepts about the problem and situation and everything than to learn only facts.

1106913.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"    this question reminds me of the time i chose my way when i was a high school student. I definitely agree with the statemant that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject because of three reasons.
    first, it provides us with a broad and comprihensive point of view. in reality, there are many problems that cannot be solved by one point view. for example, you can refer to the environmental problems or poverty and so on. the environmental problems are related to chemistry, economics, or politics. poverty is also connected with many points of view such as sociology, economics, agriculture and so on. there is no problrems that can be solved with only one point of view. you have to integrate you broad knowledge to find the solution.     second, it can give the students choices which field they want to study and have career. it is stupid to force students to choose their field without knowing many subjects and which field suits them. especially in japan, students must choose their discipline before they enter the universities. therefore, i was frustrated to do it, and chose my current program of my university which allows you to study whatever you want while you are a undergraduate students. so i really appreciate this program. like this program, studying many things can give students a chance to choose.
    lastly, it brings you a lot of fun to studying many things. people naturally have curiosity to know many things and it should not be stopped. when i learn something new, i feel really happy and want to know more. 
    for these reasons, i believe that to study many academic subjects than to specialize in one secific subject.

1607000.txt,P8,HIN,medium,"I think to be succecssful you don't need to do different things but to do things differently.

Success:

What is success and what the essential ingredients which makes a situation or a person successful?

In simple terms, success is acheiving goals with maximing efficiency. To set goal for himself and envision the future is what successful man do differently.

In life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of thoses decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally. How much a person is ready to take risk will determine how commited he is to his goals. Coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endevour.

I want to give example of Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani who established Reliance empire in less than a life-time. 

He started his career in a gas station as fuelman in some distant middle eastern country. He decided to quit his job there come back to India and use Stock excahnge to new heights. 

He has to his credit making stock market familar to common man. Stock market did exist before his advent but common man was quite aloof from it. He gained most of his financial strength from people's money.

He also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business. He was most political savvy businessman of his time which others never though of using.

Things were existing before him entering the business sphere but he gave a real meaning to them and shown the world how to use things.

This example makes it amply clear that it is how you do a thing that matter and not what you do.

With reference to this, it is very difficult to cram in few sentences my thougth about cars and the way people are used to using them nowadays. Shortly, I think that people would not continue to use cars in such an eccessive way as they have been doing for fourty years, for the following reasons: the cost of the fuel; air pollution; development of new technologies in the civil transport sector. 

	The main reason, at least in the nearer future, why people will will take the car more rarely is the increasing cost of the fuel. Families have problems in facing such an expensive cost every day. In this respect, in my personal experience I already saw people living in my building starting substituting the car with a bycicle when they do not really have the need to drive.

	The second reason why people I think will certainly prefer to take a bus, or the underground instead of the car is represented by the air pollution. Air pollution became a problem of critical importance in the cities. People cannot freely breathe on the streets. The level of air pollution has reached unsustainable ceelings nowadays and people are more conscius about the problem and started thinking about it and trying to make an effort to solve the problem.

237139.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement  because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts.

First factor is the age at this age as student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are first step for a student .At this age student can easily get the point of concepts. for example take a student of 7th standared  in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him learn the concepts then facts.

Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts.
Any student how is getting older can learn from his past about the facts. For example consider 10 th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world . So it is better for him concertrate on his studies then knowing about the facts.

Third is it's the time of student to improve his skills on the studies because if he improves his skills in it then he is automitacially learns about the facts in it. For example consider a student how is studying 12th standard he learns from his past life the facts in it .as he growsup he knows more about the facts so it is better for student to concentrate on understanding the ideas and the concepts.

Forth at the student age knowing about the facts can cause problems fro example it is not correct for primary student to know about sex in his childhood it tends to life of that student.

At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts. Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts. Any student who is getting older can learn from his past about the facts. For example consider a 10th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world . So it is better for him to concentrate on his studies then to know about the facts. Third is it's the time for students to improve their skills in their studies because if they improve their skills in it then they automatically learn about the facts in it. For example consider a student who is studying for the 12th standard he learns from his past life the facts in it . as he growsup he knows more about the facts so it is better for students to concentrate on understanding the ideas and the concepts. Fourth at the student's age knowing about the facts can cause problems . For example it is not correct for primary students to know about sex in their childhood it tends to thelife of that student. Finally i conclude that it is better for students to understand the ideas and the concepts then to learn facts at this age. 
697946.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"I agree this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Here are my reasons.
 
First, the time of the young people is always not enough. Resulting from the wealth, almost every student can study in schools, so they all have opportunity to make friends with peers in schools. Hence, in their leisure time, they always have dates with their friends. In addition, the competition of yound people is large, every students  have to not only go to school but also go to cram schools to prepare exams. Therefore,  it is almost possible for them to have time help other peoples.
  
Second, all people, not only young people, all become colder and colder. For instance, I have seen a young man just sit on his seat near a standing pregnent woman without helping her. If we don't help a person who is just surrounding us, how can we help our communities possibly? In addition, our education always teach us to study hard to get a famous college and compete with others. Therefore, we are not friendly with others because everyone is possible to be our enemy. So, we become never kind to others from our hearts.

Third, we are always unfamiliar with our heighbors. Because everyone is  busy to search for his wealthy life, he has to work hard to get high salaries or study hard to prepare to find a good job. We never have time to drink a cup of coffee with our neighbors. In addition, we all live in flats, so it is very hard for us to meet the people in the community.

To sum up, above s

Studying facts has its advantages for students. For example, students can study a lot of thing within short time. Studying formulas is the best example.  If we study how to soluve problems by certain formulas, we could utlize many problems especially Math.
  However, I strongly agree with the statement. There are more advantages to study concepts for students.  
The best example, which illustrate my point of view is studying science. When I was a child, my parents encouraged me to have curriousities. They made me to think why the rainbow is coorful and why shapes of the moon is different, and so on. Then I tried to figure out the sturucture and elements of them by myself. Sometimes I went to library to research and asked professonal people. From this process, I trained an ability of how to soluve problems. This is really important studying for childlen.
  In spite of this, if students just study facts, they regard the facts without doubtful. As many students study only facts, the new idea and concepts will not be produced. Even new technology will not progress at all. And when students encounter problems without abilities of how to soluve the problems, they can not do anything.
  The my primary consideration with respect to education is studying thinking process and concepts  are more inportant than learning facts.

I think it is wrongly done and it would be a lot more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts.It is so for many reasons: less geniuses in the world, a non evolution of the world and the promotion of a non democratic system.

       By learning facts, the students will never gain a lot. They do not really understand, they will certainly know what they are said,  will memorize it, but will never understand why is that, making them  foolishes or  machines  with no brain. It would even be harder for him to memorize the facts. But on the other hand, if he understands the ideas and the concepts, he would be able to get to the facts on his own, without having to memrize them, perfectly knowing what is going on. Understanding these concepts and ideas, the student works his brain and can even think of something new and way better. This is how the world grows and expands and the evolution goes.The student will also learn how to work on his own, express hiself, his opinions and contribute to the development of a stronger and powerful society. If they just learn the facts, it means that only one or a few persons will know the reasons, giving him or them the entire power over the others, the ability to make decisions as he wants, even if they are wrong or should not be done.

        I strongly agree with those who think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts.  We will build a more effective world that way, and promote the world solidarity .

 Nowadays, there are a lot of social problems in the world. These problems have to solve by citizens. However, if it can't solve at the first generation, the new generation, young people is needed.
Therefore, we can easily observed from the cases that most of university student is participating for their society. They sometimes resist about unfair politics or not good enough international plans.
For these case, we can realize that how they are really interested in thier society and try to help thier communities . 

 Furthermore, all societies are educating young people. This education makes student to think and adjust for their new life when they grow up. So we can not determine that they are not helping their communities. Because studying is the basic resource which makes educated people to think about social problems and to find the way to solve some problems. For a real, educated people usually participate their sociey.

 Finally, the school has a resposible for educating people without any limitations except ages. They educate not only academic resources but also the importance about helpful behaves to poor people. We can easily notice from activities in school like go to orphanage and help orphans. Of course, it is involved in the scores and most school requires the record of working for poor people.

 Young people are educated efficiently for help their communities. When they educated, they naturally have an attitudes to think about social problems as well as the student  who did not study hard. Also young people is the main resources which will manage and control the world. Thus, it is not appropriate argument that young people is not helping thier communities.

1651788.txt,P6,HIN,medium,"I agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
When we travel to some new place for ex pushkar which is in India ,this place is totally new to me and I have no idea on what exactly I should be seeing and look for.The significance of  this place is known to me but other then that I have no clue what  exactly it stands for.Tour guides are those people who will know the in and out of this place and they will have wide range of knowledge about this place and its tourist points.So once when we reach this place and visit places like Brahma temple which is one of its kind in the whole world, from these tour guides we  will get to know more about the temple ,the history,other significance etc.Apart from the  temple they will take us to  all the other places which is famous or has some other historic standing .And being in a group its always fun because we can have lot of interactions and have loads of fun.
        Apart from this if  these tour guides are travelling with us from our starting point ( the place where we departed from ) they will take care of all the hotel bookings ,our lunch /dinner ,the number of days we need to stay ,the amount of time we need to spend at each place and etc.So we tend to benefit more from them and the extra cost we will have to pay for this will be negligible.
      When the tour guide is taking care of all the above things we as tourist can just relax  and enjoy the trip .The  whole travel  is organised in a proper way and it  becomes a wonderful experience to be remembered for life long.

     In many years, since cars were created and got on sale, people have used them and had them in their lives as their legs to go where they want to go. And cars are also contribute to carry stuffs faster and easier, not just people.
     Today, cars are needed by world and peoples lives as I wrote.
But you know what cars need to move. That is gass.
People also have used much gass along with cars since they started to ride cars. But it led oils that creates gass to be used up from underground of the earth faster.
If people didn't touch, it wouldn't happen. But spending or wasting of gass is still going on now.
     So, wasting of oils caused using up of them. That is about why countries that have oils is making the oil (gass) prices higher and higher.
     Then, who need more cars that uses gass even more than now in the future?
     Looking at the plobrem, scientists are trying to find or create new kind of fuels to move the cars for gass.
For example, there is an interestion way to get new fuels.
They are finding the way out to get fuels form suger. When suger gets heated up, it makes a kind of alcohole. And that can be used for cars only if they are mixed with gass.
     Now, suger alcoholes can't be new fuel being used by itself, but scientists believe that they will finally sucssed making them completed and people will be able to start using them to ride their cars. Actually, this work is going well now by the scientists. 
And That's why I said people won't need any more cars moved by gass. 
     That can be said that it is not so far people start riding cars with new fuels, I consider. Otherwise, people won't be able to have their lives like right now with cars.
     From the reasons I wrote avobe, I agree with the idea in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

	In the first, tourists can deepen the knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists is not fammilier with the place; they don't know about the language people speaks and history, what manner and behaivor people respects and so on. Therefore, tourists is necessary to inform tourists what intresting there are; as a result, they have fun in the place. 
	Next, tourists needs the tour guide who leads there. They may lose their way, and be in troble with the paticular language and culture. For example, American childreen who go to Singapore recieved a heavy panishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place. If a tourist was along with them and teach Singapore's rule to them, they wouldn't be in the troble there.

On the one hand, even though a lot of persons can think that having information about a variety of subjects could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in his or her professional formation, on the other hand, I consider it is negative not to have a deep knowledge of one main area. Is always better to understand perfectly one thing than to have a small idea of many things.
Thereby, to have a large knowledge in one single academic subject have practical applications because, it will be easier for that person to trasmit well consolidated information to others.
Moreover, some specifics points of the academic life, according to my opinion, can only be achieved with a huge knowledge of one topic. For instance, to make a research in one area, it will be necesary to count with a lot of information in that subject.

	The first reason that there will be fewer cars in twenty years is that the pollution issue is highly concerned by people. Organizations are now devote to raise people's caoncern of the pollusion problem. Particles produced by cars are one of the main source of aair pollution. As the air pollutant will harm human beings and people are concern their health, they take the pollution problem serious. In order to tackle the problem, people will no longer use  private cars to travel, but use public transport instead. Travel by public transports are more environmental friendly, therefore, fewer private cars will be used. As people become more concern about the environment, the number of cars will decrease in the twenty years.
	Additionally, the technology progess very fast nowadays. Public transports can have high speeds and can will not take too much time for people to travel from one place to another. The time needed to travel by public transports will not differs to time needed to travel by private cars in twenty years. And the transport network will be more well developed as time past. As public transports are speedy and convenient, private cars will not have many advantages, but disadvantages as the cost of petrol, reting car park and repairment are very high. With the disadvantages of using a private car, people will tend to travel by public transports instead of private cars. Thus the number of cars will decrease dramatically in twnty years.

Some people may agree that  young peolpe don't help others, while oyhers tend to state that young people help each others  the their communities all  the time. However, I have also come to my own opinion that young people do not spend much time on helping their communities.
    First, as techonolgies improve, too many recreations  could deflect the concentration of young kids. For instance, the video games and internet, created in late 1980's, provide much more visual pleasure that before. So more and moer young people would like to spend all their to play games or chat on the net rather than give some time to help their communities. Unlike young kid before, who did have more time to interact with other members in their communities, young people nowadays have less topics of communities, except games, to discuss.  So they don't share their lives with their communities, no mention to help their communities.  
    Second, in my opinion, fewer and fewer young people nowadays do realize the meaning of helping others. It is a pitty that even in the school, teachers rarely instruct the real virtues of human. All the teachers ask young kids to do is that they should forcus on themslves, not others. They just acquire knowlege form textbooks, but they don't learn how to deal with other people, respect other peoplem,and even help other people. As a result, they do not give any support to their communities, because they don't how to do and what to do.

However, if the women learn it by heart without understanding, there is high possibility to forget about it. 
	Secondly, understanding something has a power to apply others. There are two aspects in all information we face everyday.
One is fact that we can see easily. It is like a penonmenon in nature.
We can believe what we can see. The other is  concept that we can see only when we study it and we understand it. If people understand a certain infomation, it means that people know how the information is formed, what the infomation and how they can apply it others.
It is good for students because they must have interesing about the information when they can understand it totally and apply it others.
It can make students keep studying and learning.
	Lastly, understanding  ideas is less boring than learning fats.

There are two aspects to all the information we face everyday. One is the fact that we can see easily. It is like a penonmenon in nature. We can believe what we can see. The other is the concept that we can see only when we study it and we understand it. If people understand a certain information, it means that people know how the information is formed, what the information and how they can apply it to others. It is good for students because they must have interest in the information when they can understand it totally and apply it to others. It can make students keep studying and learning. Lastly, understanding ideas is less boring than learning fats. Students do not like to learn something without certain reasons. They are not interested in learning hard and difficult facts. Therefore, we make them understand something to learn. Understanding is different from learning. It can give students a motive to learn and make them feel funny. Understanding is a logician and interesting and has the power to apply. That is why I am a"

In my opinion, it is better to have both of them as a part of your academical development, and they are both equally important.
	What truly happens in every person's academical development is that this person goes through different equally important stages. In the first stages of a childs life, this child learns how to speak, and then he or she learns how to write. This is general information that everyone should start with in the begining of their academic life.
	Then comes school, whatever, or wherever this person gets their education is all called school; Although, there are some  differences that occur on the level of that education. In school, people are taught all the essentials of life, and a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, including different sciences, mathematics, arts, music, and languages. These are the foundations each and every one of us need in our life. As the school education comes to an end, different people start to specialize in different subjects of their interests.
	Later on in life, we are approached by university; by we, i am reffering to the people who are looking at pursuing further education.

In the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their lives, and that is why they have to choose something they truly love.
	In conclusion, to have a broad knowledge on an academic subject, or to specialize in another are all equally important.

                      In the present era most of the young people have become self centered and they are not  in a mood to know about the problems of the world.they are always seeking their own comforts.
for example consider that if robbers has entered into the neighbours house of a man and he comes to know that, first he is taking care of the valuables in his house rather than helping his neighbour.
nowadays the young people are lacking in the moral and ethic values.they have become worse than the birds.i.e.if a crow is died or wounded then large number of crows gather at that place and shout,but when it come to people if a person met with an accident on a road most of them are passing as if they dont see that incident.They are not even calling the ambulance.instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness.
                     According to me this system has to change,each human should help others.One person has to help atleast three persons in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person has to ask those three individually to help three others .now nine people has benifited and these nine has to help to three others each individually.Like this if the chain has followed the the society will change and all the human beings can live hapilly.

	First, understanding ideas opens very good and big ways of thinking. It makes you think and respect other's opinions. If we look at facts, we will find that most of thefacts were just ideas in the past and by disccuss them they becam facts.

   A lot  of people think that old people are enjoy the life more than young because they think they have experiance in life. They think that this experiance will make them happy because they no what to do to be a happy person. This may not be a good idea because even if old people have an experiance they will not be able to use this experiance. They become old and harmfull. They will not be able to do every thing.

A young person can go running, play football, drive a race care and play a young people new electronic games. This will be hard to old person to do or it may be don't fit to an old person to do like electronic games.
   For most young people they like to do hard or dangeruce activities. Driving a race car in a real race can be very dangeruce for an old person he may get a hard attack. Other thing that is young people can make a plannes for the fucure, they have the time that olds don't have.

As a matter of fact it is by willingness that they have reached their goals, and having goals, dreams is already risky. Sometimes to achieve one's dream it implies that you will have to go further than your natural borders. Success goes with risk, if you do not try to do anything, and then stay with what is securing for you,  you will never be successful.
If you are already successful it will be easier for you to try plenty of new things, because you are sure of what you have already achieved. We can take the example of the President of an international company, he is setting up numerous businesses in many different sectors (such as Megastors, sodas, Aircrafts etc.), he knows what are his company competencies but he still is looking forward to create something new. Even if one or two of his new start ups fail, he will have the others to secure his position.
However, I assume that they really know what they are doing, they are not planning things that they know, they will not be able to keep. They do take risks or try new things, but they are also aware of what they can do, of what they know, and therefore, they are not risking so much in what they do.

Successful people certainly have a lot of confidence on what they can do, and in their qualities, thus they will be able to reach their own ambition in life at any price. But they are smart enough to know when and where to stop, they may take more risks but these are known and controlled. And perhaps this ambition gives them the interest in going always further.

Some people think that there will be fewer cars because of the environmental impact in wich the use of cars is sued. On the contrary the increase of the number of cars in use can be partly justified because the number of inhabitants on earth is still raising very fast.

Most importantly, rejecting CO2 cars are responsible in a wide proportion for the atmosphere pollution. Every body knows the consequences of a high grade of CO2 in the atmosphere; warmer temperature, climate changes and so on. So most of the governments, acting for the well being of its citizens, are writing new laws and inventing new solutions tending to reduce the use of cars. For instance, in paris, during the summer, only the pair or unpair  patterns number are allowed to circulate.

Secondly, we can stress the lack of petroleum or gas resources today, and the raise of pump prices. As cars are big users of petrol, their utilisation involve that car owners have the financial power to pay it. As the resources are not eternal and prices are getting higher and higher, it seems as an evidence that the number of users will decrease in the next twenty years. 

Another important argument would be that the automotive industry is very big enrgy consumer. Indeed, to make a car requires lots of products such as platsics or iron wich consumes a lot of energy to get in available form. Then the assembly chains, mostly composed  by automatic machines consumes also a lot of energy. So, in the next years, governments will probably realise that  providing very efficent popular transports would have a good impact on the country energy consumption.

In this developing and competitive world one should be more efficient and faster to survive in their life. so in my opinion the student who understands ideas and concepts is more important than the students who learn facts so as to face different competitive exams which are likely to be held in every part oflife, where they test only the output of the student rather than how much he knows about facts"

What do you think the meaning of 'enjoy'?
Young people can enjoy more kinds of sports than old people do because their physical condition allows more chance to do like snow board, motorcycle, mountain climbing, sky diving which are need more wild actions and physical abilities.  No one can say old people can enjoy these sports too. 
The sports is one of the most important way of enjoying our life.

Furthernore old people are much more conservative than young people when they challenge something new in their life.  
For example, they have to consider their family and company before challenging new things.  However young people feel more free to launching new things.  They are much bravier than old people so that they can experience more about new world eventhough they fail sometimes.  That is o.k for young people because they have plenty of time to recover their fail or mistakes.

Therefore, Young people can enjoy life more than old people.
I didn't mean old people cannot enjoy life but they have more restriction than young people.

I know it is a common belief that during the youth one has a wider range of activities to enjoy, but a more carefully view of the facts might change this position. There are two main factors that could support my point. 

In first place, an important factor is the experience. The experience gives a person the capacity of making better decisions but also gives one a better perspective of life. Both things help older people to enjoy some events or things which young people do not. Secondly, older people usually can be benefited from resources they have save during their youth. Thus, the avaliability of greater resources among older people can also contradict the idea that young people enjoy life more than those older ones. Commonly, young people have to spend a lot of time generating those resources.

However, it has to be said that young people have some other advantages over older people regarding the capacity of enjoy some activities. The main advantage is naturally their energy and -usually- health. Young people have more energy and are usually healthier. For that reason they can enjoy better things involving physical activity. The main example of this is sexuality, but there are a lot of other examples like sports.

This abusive use of cars raises pollution,  acustic problems and other effects like the global warming or the greenhouse effect caused by the gases that cars, between other things, take to the atmosphere.

It means that cars like we know now won't be used in twenty, thirty or fourty years instead of other cars which consume other fuels will be in use.

   Besides, projects like ecocities and many managements from different cities promove the public transport, creating new lines or just making the public transport available now cheaper. At least in theory, these facts contribute to reduce the use of cars.

   As far as I am concerned, I believe that cars whose fuels are made by vegetables sustances like oils will remplaced our cars, but I am not sure at the time to affirm that there will be fewer cars in the future. Big cities have usually traffic jams and problems with car parkings and the noise that they causes and it is true that public transport are growing faster now.

      Young people have the life in them where they should make some memories for the future life.And young people can really have fun time with they friends and relatives and lead they life to the fullest.young people still have the life which is just started can some young people really do enjoy life hanging out with friends and will have fun time.Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way.they have the life which they have it in their hands.
        Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs.they feel experimenting with them is a enjoyment.But those r not really enjoyment things its infact which apoil the carrier of the youngster.those kind a enjoyment is to be ristricted and enjoyment should be done such that he has good time andd good memories which he can share with his young generation.
Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more capability to have enjoy .Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment.But older people cannot have much enjoyment as the youngster's as they got no energy and capability to enjoy.Older people wil have to think off their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories.
   Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying.Those youngster age doen't permit to control from having fun.even in school or at education places we have special time for refreshing and enjoyment for youngster's this is only because youngster should have enjoyment equally with studies.they is a saying by our great scholors saying""All work no play makes a man lazy"" youngster's need some with for fun appart from their routine education life.this is mainly to have peace off mind and relaxcation
Young people are more flexible when compaired to old people they can do any adventure where as old people all depend on young people.
         Young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more time and intrest towards enjoyment and youngsters have to give importacne to the enjoying life to make himself active in all basis.young people really have great energy and emthusiasm towards enjoyment they can enjoy the whole day but they dont get tired this is only because off intrest.this intrest is to be provoked in studies.
  Therefore i totally agree with the abouve statement saying ""Young people enjoy life more than olkder people do""because older people should have sweet and unforgettable memories in their age and this is can be only done by older people only if they enjoy they life in the young age.The starting and ending of life depends on the enjoyment basis which is only obtained at the young age. 
","""Young people are strong and dynamic"" These words are proved by great scholars and philosophers of our country. I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun . young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started . Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands. Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs. they feel experimenting with them is an enjoyment. But those r not really enjoyable things in fact which apoil the carrier of the youngster. those kinds of enjoyment are restricted and enjoyment should be done so that he has a good time and good memories which he can share with his young generation. Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more ability to enjoy themselves. Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment. But older people cannot have as much enjoyment as youngsters as they have no energy and capability to enjoy themselves. Older people will have to think about their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories. Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying themselves. Those youngsters' ages don't permit them to control themselves from having fun. even in school or at educational places we have special time for refreshing and enjoyment for youngsters  . This is only because youngsters should have enjoyment equally with studies. It is a saying by our great schoolteachers saying""All work no play makes a man lazy"" youngster needs some fun apart from their routine education life. this is mainly to have peace of mind and relaxation Young people are more flexible when compared to old people they can do any adventure, whereas old people all depend on young people. Young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more time and interest in enjoyment and youngsters have to give importance to enjoying life to make themselves active on all basis. young people really have great energy and enthusiasm for enjoyment they can enjoy the whole day but they dont get tired this is only because of their interest. this interest is to be provoked in studies. Therefore i totally agree with the above statement saying ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do""because older people should have sweet and unforgettable memories in their age and this can only be done by older people only if they enjoy their life in the young age. The starting and ending of life depends on the enjoyment basis which is only obtained at a young age. "

381881.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"Yes i agree with the concept  to discuss about that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Because by understanding the idea only a student can make desitions currectly. By understanding the concepts he or she can judge easily and can get through it. Most of the students understand the idea such that they can do the things better and get grip on that particular idea and also he can learn more things about the idea he learnt.

  For an example a student preparing fo his exams coming over in few days, to get rid of that he must read properly that he must not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need for mugging up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam. 

        Understanding the idea and concepts the student can learn the facts. For example listerning the lecture in the professers class there we need more concentration in the class, such that the student must understand the concept and perform well in the exam or in the seminar etc.

            By understanding the ideas and concepts he can perform them very perfectly. 

           The ideas like in the software field  we must learn and understand the concepts to perform well in our interviews, and also in the running project. There is the only way that to learn the concept and implement it where ever it is use ful in our lifes.
                          
           As mentioned above example that the many students mug up the conceptes and fail in the exams so there is the only solution for this is to understand the concept and inplement the faces.

You can whether choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risk for being successful. I definetely believe that people should try new things and take risk for being succesful.
	If you do everything with a routine that means you know the results. For example if a farmer use traditional ways for agriculture, he can guess how much crops he will get. He can avoid risks by doing that. But it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he won't be successful. He will get as same amount crop as next year. The point I am trying to make is, that is not a vakid way for being a suscussful person. On the other hand he could try different ways in order to get much crop which means taking risk for success.
	In my opinion, successful people try new things and take risks. For instance, if the farmer try a new agriculturel way which is not experienced before he can get a different amount of crops. he could get whether '' less or much'' but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk. I already know that lots of successful people in business area tried new things and figure out new ways. That is the main reason of their success. For instance a very well known newspaper owner was just a writer in a newspaper. He decided take risk, he resinsged and established a local newspaper and then he made it success. And we all know that newspaper owner today.

But why I agree with the statement? There is a simple reason: The most important thing in the advertisement world is to persuade people to buy anything, in a lot of cases, things that probably  people never is going to use. There are two posiblly reasons that makes that the advertisement people do this. One is the money and the other aspect is the people's ignorance.

The money is the first reason that makes to do this. In a world when only the most powerfull survive, the money is the best way to get the things. It means, that if you have money, you have power. And it is what the bussiness men and the companies want: power. 
Then, if they have succesfull with their products, they are going to have money and consecuently power. 

For that reason is that the advertisements make productos seem so much better than they really are. The money, and the obsession for money get that the companies and the advertisement people do not take care about the quallity of the products. It is like ""if that did not work, it is better for us. Now you are obligated to buy again our product"".

The second reason why most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is the people ignorance. For example, if you see the new product to lose fat on TV, probably you want to have this at home and in the 95 percent of the time this product is not going to help you. But the adverstisemente tell you that you need drink or eat this for five years or something like that. Then, the problem is that if the people does not enouhg information and keep in the ingnorance, they are going to buy the product during five years.   

But, why do you think that one simple capsule or one simple tea is going to help you to lose fat? Do you think that is simple? No, it is no simple. This is a large proccess that need so much time and work. But the advertisemente tell us that it is not necesaty, and we believe they.

As a conclution, I think that this problem, this lie that the advertisement people give us, should have regulated by the Goberment of each country. Why? Because it is not possible that they, for money, power and ignorance, give us a lie, a false product.

Regarding to my opinion young people today have a lot more possibilities to create their life.
First they have the opportunity to go long to school and afterwards studying whatever they want to.
Older people never had this great opportunity, nor the money for such a comfortable life. 
Second is the creation of the wide range of spare time activities. 
There are so many new possibilities what one can do in leisure time, which have not existed in the time when the older people were young, and what they now cannot do any longer because of health problems.
The variety goes from sports, culture, travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country.
From this I want to move to the next point: foreign studies.
Younger people don't even have the great oppotunity to study, but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice.
This is an important extraordinary experience, which has a great impact on the later life. Living in a country for a period of time is something else than beeing on vacation. The young have the opportunity to learn really from other cultures ans so probably develop a different view about many things in early years of their life.
Older ones can do this after years of work and can't take the chances in that way.

But one has also take into account the carreer chances offered to the young people.
With the money from the parents it is possible to live in a big city whre many great companies are. So they have a greater chance to move from home to another city and live independent.

To conclude, one can say there are various things what make the life for young people easier and more comfortable than in the past and even in the future for the older people of our society.

Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time,than it is not about being successful,but about being lucky.The best example for this is Thomas Edison.He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he was not be able to invite it.He always tried and tried.He said that,`I tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never give up trying.I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful about this finding.`It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way.He managed;because he took all the risks on this way.

In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do.If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first.People need to try new things.Furthermore,in the schools.Teachers ask questions to their students.Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question.Even the solution that the student did is wrong,this is the best way of learning the right for students.Specially in Mathematics classes.Even though I was not sure about the solution,I always wanted to try to solve and I was always the volunteer.

The last but not least,the way which goes to succeed is not always clear,there is often difficulties.For example,someone wants to study abroad,brings everything in his behind and goes to the country where he will study.In this situtation,he takes a risk loosing his all relationships between friends and even between his family. Moreover,he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country.If he needs a help,then there is nobody at the first times when he goes this country.On the other hand,at the end of this risks,he will return to his own counrty as knowing new languages and being a gratuated from a university,new opportunities etc.There is only thing why he did so many things,just for being successful,for being an important man in his job.

All in all,as i said before,for being successful,taking risks is the most important thing.Both,if someone takes risks then at the and of that,it is surely that he wiil be able to manage this,and if someone gets successful for the first time,is not about being successful.My motto is,experience is the mother of wisdom.If persons experience all the ways and take all the risk,it is understandable that they are gonna be successful and manage what they want to do.

Young people are full of energy, which means that besides their study and work, they have much more energy to have fun. Young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and fun. At night, the dancing bars are full of young people. They dance, talk to each other and drink together. During the holidays, young people drive to the mountain or the sea shore for hunting, canoeing or hiking. Because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work, they cannot spend as much time as the young people on the holiday travels. They normally stay at home and watch the TV or chat with their old friends.  

Young people have more new methods to enjoy the life because their brains run faster than old people. Because there are a lot of  pressure from the job, young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged. Young people develop new methods everyday and then spread them all over the world. They practise new methods of entertainment and discuss them on the network. On the contrary, old people normally stick to few kinds of entertainment for a long time and  do not want to try new methods.

Old people know how to enjoy life and they have their methods of enjoying life. But comparing with the young people, they spend less time and energy in enjoying the life.

From the above discussions, it is safe to conclude that young people enjoy the life more than older people.

I have to try many risks during the elaboration the this cars, I have to risk much money in employers that they be more preparated and I must give them all the necesities that the government's law requirs.

One person who does not like to be altruist and success does not try any thing because he or she has scare and always they will be  people comfortables and aphatics. by the way those persons who try take risk their will recognize in many places of the world.

 One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time for their communities is the school rul. In high school and college they have a kind of rul -like a homework- that a student have to help his or her community at list 10 hour per year. We could think that school has this kind of rul to teach importance of helping community, but the truth is they have this rul because it's hard to see young people giving time for their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. 

 Second reason is commuties are in need of helpers. They have a lot of things to do so thay need many people. Almost communities do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people. As long as there is  no young people who wants to help the communities, communities leave works undond and this is happening a lot. 

 Why the young people don't help their communities? It's because young people think that spending time ofor theit communities is such a wasting time. To change this mind of young people, we have to give them programs or opportunity to make them realize the importance of helping communities.

    I think we cant say young people dont give enough time to helping their communities since young peole are working for global problems like individual rights of all people in the world, human rights, enviromental problems or food supply like in African countries so the the concept of their country disappeared and young people are thinking in a global viwe point.

Later they are working in their countries about their collegues. this the beginning of their professinol life start in their home country and then later, most of them start to work for the international componies which are result of global economy.

Such two different types how to handle with risk will reach the final success.
People have different kinds of meanings about their own apility of risk.
If I think about such difference, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examination with a grade of 1.2 during his school periode. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studing time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economic or in gereral with business had taken place for him with 26 years in a big company as an assistante for law specific questions for consoulting contracts. He was very resistent against risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experiences, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. 


My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grad around 2.5, which hab been the middlefield in his final examination year. He started an own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and middle sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consoulting work of his company. He had have a lot of fixed costumers, which needed his help regularly. During such periode he had have the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria.
Banks helped him to fullfil such target by offering a lot of money. After two years he had have 4 office outside Germany and a sum of 4.500.000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank.
The concept failed by the crash of the new market and he lost all the life standart almost in 2 month and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time.

As a conclusion of my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status.
Moreover people with a ability to try risks, will have a faster success and will be stay there, if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparision to the risk resident people.

Young people have a lot of problems during their life. In particular, they have social problems. For example, they have difficulties to have relationships and they are not able to related wiht the society. As a result they prefer to stay alone. 

Furthermore, in many cases young people during their study must find absolutely a job. Young people after the work they want to spend their time wiht theis friends or families. 

Moreover sometimes young people disagree with the decisions taken by their communities. As a consequence they dont' want to help them.

In conclusion, I believe that today the young people don't help their communities. Nevertheless, I believe that communities must find solution to push young people to help them to solve problems.

It could be a problem if the advertisement say lies during its presentations or present inexact information that could guide the consumers to a invalid choice. For example if a detergent advertisement presents a cleaning proof, comparing two types of detergentes, it has to present the truth result because there are laws that protect the consumers against abuse and missinformation.

Because of this laws the advertisement world have to be very carefull in the presentation of facts and images and they have developed. Over the years, they have developed many tactics for saying the maximun great things about their products without telling a lie but making the consumers think that their products are the best when sometimes its not the case. For example, talking about beauty spots in the tv, everyday we can see that in the screen supermodels using cremes and beauty products that they say put the skin or hair in an excellent condition but we are fooling ourselves if we think that using that products it will make that we became as beautiful as those supermodels. That is not the fault of the advertisement guys because it is their work try to make their products the most desiderable for us.

807318.txt,P2,SPA,medium,"Long has been written whether young people enjoy life more than older people do, as well as how old people enjoy life more than young people do. Nevertheless, I consider that enjoying life has more to do with people's attitude toward life than with them being young or old. Therefore, I will try to describe some ideas in order to support that enjoying life has much more to do with an attitude than with age.

For example, many people could think that enjoying life may be related to lifetime, therefore if you are young person you could enjoy life more than if you are old. Old people could think that  young people have much more energy, or more activities in a day and therefore they enjoy life much more than them. The only thing they don't stop to think is that usually young people don't have as much spare time as old people could have.
On the other side, many young people could possible think that old people enjoy life much more than them since they are retired and the could do whatever they want with their time.

As I have stated before, I definitely consider that enjoying life has more to do with waking up every morning feeling as if you need to do something, either walking, running, eating, sleeping, working, etc. and how you will manage to take the best part of the day. No matter if you are young or old, if you have lots of things to do every day or no, the only point is the attitude you put to live every day in order to be able to enjoy it.

Finally, I could say that enjoying life is not related to age since both being young or old you can enjoy life as much as you want.

1806306.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"   I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are three reasons in my opinion which led to the situation.

   First, there are too many amusing activities to do. New high-tech toys and recreations are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stick on those things. Big companies uses strong advertisement and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spending time on the products. Moreover, interacting with friends takes most of young people's time. All of these activities occupied every minute of them.

   Second, the education from young people's parents does not give them the idea. To live in a competetive world, children are taught to learn knowledges as much as they can and give attention to other things as less as they can. Cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around. They are told to keep their hands from things that are helpless to their grades. Due to this twisted concept, young people are not interested in communities activities.

   Third, the media broadcasts negative examples which stop young people from taking action. People refuse to give time helping their communities because of bad news. A crazy person might hurt an unexperienced teenager while asking for help. Teenagers can be in trouble because their lack of experience on helping the communities. 

   Above all, it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. By observing those who live around, we can find out that young people will help if the negative conditions are removed. Creating a nice and friendly environment for teenagers to open their mind will be the best way to let them give more time on communities activities.

            In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts.
            People in these days seem to pay a lot attention to ideas, but the fact is, this made a lot of useless 'inventions'. For this, I saw a new 'invention' the other day. It was a little fan that could be tied on the arm, which could be used for cooling off the hot noodles while people are picking up the noodles. The fan is not tiny, but even if it is, is there really a lot of consumers for this kind of product? I do not think so. If i were the customer, i won't even bring a fan to a restruant just for cooling off the noodles. This is one example for people only get the idea but not the fact.

As we can see in the everyday life there is a decresing amount of space to get around with cars.
 Parking it is becaming a real challenge,and the frustration that builds everyday is assuming very big proportions.
The statistics showed that in twenty years the population of the world will be at about six billions.Right now we are only four billions.
What that means is that the level of pollution of the air it will be unlivible for any human kind.
The space available per person will decrease and the drivers will have an increase in anger   .
Unfortunately we are able to see that in Indonesia right now.
Their problem is that everybody uses a car.
Therefore,living in a confined country,with an increasing population doesn't allow a sanitary and better life.
So,to avoid this problem,we should decrease the number of cars by simply applying to few rules.
First of all,we should make a law that  forbids people to drive by themselfes.
What i mean is that cars should be considered for a minimum of four people.
If that doesn't happen the owner of  the car shouldn't  be allowed to drive,penalty a tiket or worse.
Then the community should make available more community rides like  buses or any other vehicle that hold more people than a car. 
Doing so, we should be able to decrease the number  of cars, the pollution of the air,the gas consumption,that nowdays is reaching incredible prices and we should be able to decrease the frustration and anger of everybody.
In the meanwhile,another good thing that could be done is allow the circulation only to the vehicles that have a gpl or a methane implant.
That doesn't decrease the number of cars in circulation,but at least decrease the air pollution.

Firstly , we can see that different banks are emerging today in this competetive market . These banks provide loans at a very affodable rate of interest such that any one can think of buying a car. Besides this , the car sellers are comming up with different types of intresting and profit making schemes such that everyone prefer to buy a car. Schemes like providing insurance free of cost, free equipments along with the car and many more things which attracts people to buy the car.

Secondy, as i said earliar that competetion are increasing daily , so car manufacturs are making cars having so many facilities that people are tempted to buy it. Facilities like a small refrigerator, racks for keeping books, mobile charger,music system and many things. We can take a example of a very busy person. If he gets so much facilities in his own car then he dont have to wait or go any where for water or dont have spend any time in charging his mobile as all these things can be done while he going somewhere. At the same time they manufacture cars that requires very less maintainence.

Then , now a days people are giving much attention to the health as pollution made by factories and other things are increasing day-by-day . So instead of buying a two wheeler they prefer to buy a car which is more safer and at the same time they can be free from pollution.

So as the world is moving forward so fast people also want to cope up with everyone, regarding status , health , wealth and everything. So i think that the number of cars are surely going to increase twenty years from today.

Because he doesn't want to lose his reputation and there are so many companies that want to see their programs make a better profit than him, sell more copies than Microsoft, Bill Gates' company, does. So he wants his company to the keep improving and to make new products to the computer users.
      Also a basketball or a soccer player needs to improve himself and try add new things to his playing style. Because if don't try new moves and make regular moves that they are doing all the times, the opponent can control them easily, defender can defend them easily. And if they keep playing in the same way they can't have an effect on match so even they can be cut from the team and broke.

	First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts aren't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think the most of the kids doesn't know which of these. Do you know why?  The most oof the parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of the things. And that makes children interests. 
	Second, the facts and concepts are more specific thing. Every adults thinks, they are difficult for children so the children don't have to know about that. That is not true. The truth is the adults don't know about the facts and concepts. That's why they saying about that. They don't know so the children doesn't have to know. I think that's kind of stupid. And the adults scare about the kids will learn that something they don't know.

BILL GHATES made a lot of money form creating a software called windows and EINSTINE made a great theory such as E=mc2. Even the way they succes is different the common thing is that they gave there entire life to built it. In my opinion successful people doesn;t try new thing but try to develope the thing they can do well.
	BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old. At that time there was two famous company called MACANTOSHI & APPLE(well later they united though). He tried to learn computer because if was very interesting. later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself. This kind of result was able because he constantly developed his talent. In my opinion for succesing finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important.
	EINSTINE is also a succesful persone is physics. His new theory about black energy, black holes, times, lights and movement destroied newton and platon's theory and made a new page is the history of physics. It is hard to believe that this huge theory was made by a single man. In my opinion that the reasone it was able is because he always thaught about physics. Many books and researches says that he thaught about physics 60 percent of his time. As you can see successful people developes there talents rather than finding a new way.
	To conclude I think that successful people find there talent and develope what they already know how to do rather than finding a new thing to do. It is because no pains no gains. not trying any thing and seeking for chances to succeed can never make a good result.

There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides.On my opinion it would be better if you have a broad knowledge  of many subjects.
	The reason why this is on my opinion will be written down in the following text.
First i want to say, that if you have a broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies.So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic.Maybe the company you want to be hired is searching for a person who knows things of every part of a firm.A reason can be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone.Then they can hire you for a work but if a person of another work is missed,you are able to do his work too.
	Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than specializing in one part.You should know everything about this part.I want to give an example.If you want to specalize in marketing,you have to know everything about it.You can only be hired in this part of a firm.And if you are not be needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked.But if you have the knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm.
	A third advantage of a broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things. you can learn new things in all parts of academic.It would be boring if you do the same things the whole of your life.A broad knowledge gives yiu the possibility that you can change yor work.Your life would be more exiting.

From my point of view there are lot of things that make me feel like agreeing with this statement. For example younger people are usually not that setteled or depending on other persons, which makes you enjoy life more and live freely. In younger years one doesn't think that much about the difficulties of life that may appear later on, such as illnesses or financial security problems. Furthermore one usually goes to college or university in younger years where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway, apart from some learning times. So yes, I would say that the circumstances in your younger years make it often more easy to really enjoy life than in older years.

But on the other hand I think- and I can only think about it because I am in my younger years at the moment- the older people as well have their very own way of enjoying life. Surely they'll do it in a different way because it's not all about parties and having fun, but with a life-experience I am sure one can enjoy life at a different level.
Looking back on what offered life for you, everything you've been already able to enjoy and all the goods and bads you've gone through I think one can enjoy life as much as young people. Apart from that I can imagine that a lot experience, which you definitley have as an older person, can give a good measure as well concerning what is really worth to enjoy and what is not.

So to bring it up to a point I wouldn't say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Perhaps both groups enjoy and spend their time in different ways but in total I am sure that both are able to enjoy at a similar level.

1886379.txt,P1,ZHO,medium,"  The issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge.There are three reasons why I think that.
  First of all , It will be very boring to study one subject for a long time.In fact , you might get totally exausted and you might even lose the interest in that subject. For example, students who are  good at calcualtion study math for a long time would also want to change the studying subject to a subject that can read without using your hands or brain.
 Secondly, you can know what you are really interest in when you study a bit of various subjects. This is the reason why educations don't focus on a specific subject and it also can make up the choice which what we really like of a student after a long time basic education till high school. For example, we decide what major we want to study after entering universities. We can decide by the interest we developed since we started elementary school.
  Futhermore, I believe with the advantage of  learning everying a bit give more opportunities of choosing various job. we can use our broad knowledge instead of one specific idea to apply jobs we want  in the future. For example , people who want to study hotel management when they apply to thier universities. People who put hotel management as their major need to lean a lot of things than just management. As far as i know, they need to know about different kind of wines, business ,economy and communication among people.
  In conclusion, I prefer that people should learn more than just a subject.

Then nobody will be there to help you with your recovery since  are alone .But if are travelling in a group the other people will take you to hospital  and help you through your recovery .


Secondly if you travel in a group you can exchange your ideas about the place or about the culture of the place you are visiting   and the local customs because in certain regions of the world some things we do might offend the people .So if you are in a group pleople who has already visited or read about the place can tell you about it .If you are alone you will not have this oppourtunity for you .  For examle pointing fingers at persons at people in India is termed Disrespectful and if you go there and unknowling if you point fingers at others than you might offend the people there . 


Thirdly if in a team if you are lead by tour guide he or she will take you to the best places ,unknown sitesand will tell you the importance of the place .This way you will reduce the time to see the place and can use the remaining for the the relaxation purose .


               So i finally i conclude that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is usually pleasant , helpful ,reliable and best way  .So keeping in mind of all the advatages it is best  travel in a group led by a tour guide

Young people nowadays have different task to do from the people who were young in the past. Today the life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different respect 20 years ago.

A young person have to go to Collage or University, maybe he have to work if he wants to pay his study or others activities. The free time is not a lot so, when a student is free, he use to go out with his friends and to think about the enjoy activities like to go to disco or listening to music. Someone can think that it is selfish but I am sure that a young person must have a leasure time. However the time can be spent for the communities. It's quite true that a lot of young people don't like help their communities. 

The young newadays people are not all lazy. I can explane this point by a clear example. Last week I went to a rock party which was organized by one of my best friends. He worked a lot becouse this event was wonderful, but he did it with others guys. The party was a music competition. The people were a lot and everyone was very happy because the players were fantastic and the organization too. 

In conclusion I think that today young people are different from the young people in the past so a comparison is not so easy. The free time is less and the things to do are more. The young people mistake is to think that to do something for the communities is bored. Fortunately there are some people who think different!

Companies have to make a profit by selling their products or services to the people as much as possible.  They most of the times conduct some studies to graps the public favarite in order for reflect the results to the advertisement.

Recently, the development of the technology has made it possible for the companies to thier things look more attractive in the advertisement.

In some extreme cases, completely created computer graphic images are used as a photo of the product.    

Sometimes the companies do too much to make their products look better, and people would doubt about the product in thier hands is really the same thing they saw in the advertisement.  In this kind of case, the consumer is sort of decieved by the coompany.  That is why government has to take some action to prevent the company from advertising with exagaration.  However, in the matter of fact, government sees the companies than the consumers because the companies pay a lot more tax if they make larger profit.

Even though there are some good points in advertisements, such as helping people to choose which product to buy, or providing new information about the product, I personally think that the strikter rule should be established to restrict the exagration of the product, and companies must have to try to be honest, trusting the quality of thier product.

For any freshman students, ofcourse he/she will complain about these non-related subjects. But, when they finish their study they will realize the reasons why our university has done it, like I did. I agree with the statements saying that ""it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"" for several reasons.

	First of all,  having a wide knowledge of many academic subjects would give ones the power of faceing any problems in the society later when ones garduate or even before. Secondly, that knowledge would give ones a greate apprortunity to find the job he/she would like to be in not nessary linked to the academic specialization. A computer engineering student, for example, attending different classes in designing and programming would give him/her better chance in finding a job than if he/she did not attend these classes. Almost all job managers are looking for people with many different skills in different aspects of the life than an excellent computer engineer who does not know how to deal with customers or collegues. Most importent reason, is that attending different classes with different people in each class means that ones will get to meet many people in his acadmic life. This well help every student to gain more experience for future work life. Learn how to deal with others is a very important skill, because all jobs are baised mainlly on dealing with the manager, dealing with teammates if ones is working in team project and so on.

	In conclusion, I think all students should have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than sticking to only one subject even if they are not required to take different subject because it will help them a lot in their future lives. 
","At my university, besides our specialization there are different subjects we must take in order to graduate. For any freshman students, ofcourse he/she will complain about these non-related subjects. But, when they finish their studies, they will realize the reasons why our university has done it, like I did. I agree with the statements saying that ""it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"" for several reasons. First of all, having a wide knowledge of many academic subjects would give one the power of facing any problems in society later when one is a graduate or even before. Secondly, that knowledge would give one a great opportunity to find the job he/she would like to be in not necessarily linked to academic specialization. A computer engineering student, for example, attending different classes in designing and programming would give him/her a better chance of finding a job than if he/she did not attend these classes. Almost all job managers are looking for people with many different skills in different aspects of life than an excellent computer engineer who does not know how to deal with customers or colleagues. The most important reason, is that attending different classes with different people in each class means that one will get to meet many people in his academic life. This will help every student to gain more experience for future work life. Learning how to deal with others is a very important skill, because all jobs are mainly based on dealing with the manager, dealing with teammates if one is working on a team project and so on. In conclusion, I think all students should have a wide knowledge of many academic subjects than sticking to only one subject even if they are not required to take different subjects because it will help them a lot in their future lives.

          Many people travle to anothere country to learn or to see the 
other cultures. in order to do that people should have some i
nformation about the country thery are going too . Then they can konw more about the country or the place thery are planning to go to. there many way to do that one for example reading abook or ask some freinds or go to atravel agency to help them or to advise them to place that they sould go to. i think the best way of having more information and konlwegd is have tour giude that can help the travlers and makre them have fun. 


    I think that is i good way to know more information and make the travelers dont miss the best places that people should visite. I think that more effective and helpfful because, having a tour guide and he or she is usualy form the place that the traveler are heading too. The tour guide will provied much inforamtiom and rsonse to the traveler much then asking  a freind. For example he or she will have the best to teach or inflounce the traveler.

      In addetion, some times the tour giude will teach the traveler the country clutures and languge or slang that travel agency can not do.That will make them have more infornmation knowleged and inflonuce about the people who live in this country. 

   Also, it will make it easy for the travelr to ask them about the culture. Because usualy traveler have a lot of question that they need to now about the culture that they are going to and it is not easy for them to ask someone who live there. Also the tour giude can interduoce the people or the travelr to the cultur food or best places to go or the best hotles or city because they will much konlwged about it. For example, last year i went with my famliy to Hong Kong, China which is the biggest city the east cosat of China. We had toure giude, he helkp us and lead us to the right places that it is covienet for my family and the othere travelers who were with us in the group. actually he advises us to the cheap and good hotle for us.

   
 I think that people should tkae a tour giude if they want to enjoy there time and mkae thier trips teach them and inflounce them beside just having fun.

	Firstly, it is generally accepted that young people are more impulsive than old people. Therefore, young people use to do things without certain plans. For example, in my personal experience, I had been on trip without any plans with my friends. One day, one of my friend suddenly suggested to go trip and we just agreed to go trip in that day, because we were young and impulsive.

	Secondly, it it normally accepted that young people are more energetic rather than old people. In fact, it is hard to enjoy life such as go trip or go picnic for old people because they are less energetic. However, young people are always energetic in general. Therefore, it can be described one reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

	Lastly, it seems clear that young people are more creative than old people. They always bring something new and creative and move into action. It is a one of way that they enjoy their life creatively. Moreover, in my personal experience, one day, I and my friend were thinking about making fake ID. Therefore, we moved into action and tried it. Unfortunately or Fortunately, we were charged by a police officer lightly, however, it exists as a still interesting memory for me.

	To sum up, I can generally state that young people enjoy life more than older people do. In my home country, there is a old traditional song about that enjoying life when we are young, when we become old then we cannot. All things considered, it is true about that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

However some peole don't. They hold opinopn that sucessful people would try news things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages. From ma personal pespective, i would prefer the second opinion.
  first of all, doing what they already know how to do well is more safe do get suceed, however, it may also make you lose something that may even more important. Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you are only do what you already konw at your times, you may fall behind the times.

First of all; Having an extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist about this area. it is so important feature about making your job good. If you improve yourself really extraordinarily about a specific subject, it also brings you success and powerty. For instances; you are a doctor and you are really successfull in your job.

Although it is true that having broad knowledge can help people in various problems, as far as I am concerned, I conceive that specializing in one specific subject is more preferable to having broad knowledge in our life.  I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea.
The first reason is that because the society will change more complicated, the demand for the specialized knowledge or skills would increase. In fact, in ancient age, people should do everything well to survive, but now people don't need to be capable of everything. For example, famous baseball star can earn enomous amout of money only because of his abilities of throwing balls fast.
The second reason is that in modern society people cannot obtain broad knowledge of many specific subject. Nowadays socioty new knowledges and skills are produced so fast and much that we can't keep up with the pace of the development.

1457945.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"Personally i completly agree with this statement. Not only i think this statement is true, but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act.
I'm sure that one of the most important guideline to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful, first of all you have to spent a lot of it!
All the successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evoluting their companies and buying or creating new ones.
I also think that one of the most important thing for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power!
It really doesn't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached...keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives.
I can pick up a very well known example of a person which has been really successful: Silvio Berlusconi. The intention is not to discuss about he's politic ideas, but to analyse goals a person has reached. A man which has always lived following this principle. At the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developping new companies. Some of these always in the field of media, but some not, like the italian football team AC Milan which he bought 20 years ago.
Another example can be seen in the american Bill Gates. Can you imagine if he would have stopped creating and inventing computer softwares after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway. Probably we would be now less evoluted. Bill Gates is that kind of example that makes me think that this risking, sometime innovative and brave people are, in some occasions, also very important for the evolution of mankind itself.

At a time the young people also worked hard to reach their goals and to reched their ambitions.They are doing hardwork and enjoy at a time.They are seperated their time for working and for enjoying.Now these present days so many young people are worked in many great companies and corporate companies,then they all are worked weekly five days for company and remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family.So young people also do hardwork but they make some shedule and follow that.
Now so many young people are worked under some company or worked under some institute,But these companies and institutes are build by old people.So old people are worked in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run that institutes and companies.From the above two sentences i can say that old people are worked hard than young people so with that reason they  reached higher levels.
And these present days also have some yong managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists,But they all are get that companies and that industrys from their parents and they run that companies verywell.For suppose Anil Abani is great indusrialist and great managing director for Relience companies.But he get them from his father and he also workhard and developing their companies and developing their shares in present market.
So finally i am supporting that the young people are enjoy their life more than older people and also they are workedhard and get good positions in their lifes.And for hardworking older people one of the best example is Bill Gates.He is the owner of microsoft company.But now his child that means his younger child are doing enjoy well and they are get that property from their parents and they are develope that company with hardwork.

   There are many places in which young peple enjoy and older people can not.  For example, game center is the place where we can play many games.  Many young people go to there and enjoy games.  However it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people.     
  Also, I think that young people have chance to communicate with people more.  Young people go to schools and meet friends.  They also can join many activities out of the school.  Older people may join some activities but there are not many activities for older people.  In my experience, I went to the USA last year as an exchange student nad I met alot of people who I could not see if I was in Japan.  If I were older, I am sure that I could not go to America and have great experiences. 
   In addition, older people have physical problems.  It is hard for older people to go to many palaces and enjoy all of them.  However young people have more enagy so they do not get tired easily.

1038393.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"Can you imagine your city with fewer cars? I think that I can imagine Madrid, where I live, in that way but I think that it is going to be a hard and a long task. The enviromental problems, the price of the gas and the parking spaces, the traffic jumps and the cheap and fast alternatives instead of the car will push towards the direction of fewer cars. 

One of the many reasons why I think that will be fewer cars in twenty years is that the pollution in the big cities it is a big problem and many people have, and will have, diseases due to this. The alternative are cars friendly with the enviroment such as the new cars designed by the Japanese brands.

Other reason why I think that will be fewer cars is that the price of the gas is very expensive due to the wars and due to that the people are not using their cars. The other big problem in the big cities is that there are not enough parking spaces in the street and the prices of the existing ones are very high, and can cost as much as one luxury car.

The main reason why I think that the number of cars will be reduced in the future is that in the main cities there are cheap and fast alternatives to the car such as the tube or the bus, that can take you to every part of the city in no time without being stopped in one traffic jump for hours. 

Definetely, I think that in the future will be fewer cars but still a lot of cars. We can try to reduce the number of cars, but I believe that we can not live without it. We should take the bus or the subway if we can and use the car as the last alternative.

Young people don't have problems with moneys because they can always ask to their parents if they need them. Using the parent's money they can buy a sail boat for the summer in order to enjoy the sea during the summer or they can buy a pair of ski for the winter time.
During the summer school vacations they can also travel around the world using airplains or boats. They can, for example, organize a tour of all the main  towns of Europe. In every town they can try different restaurant, go to see concerts and drink all night long.
When they are at home they can use internet to buy several items, meet new people and create their personal website.

There are some reasons that might suggest this as for example that younger people are normally more healthy then older people. Of course if an old person has to use a wheelchair he is going to enjoy his life less than a younger one without wheelchair. Also younger people might have less obligations and responibilities than older people. Studying is assumed to be mainly fun.

But this seems to be a popular illusion. Today, through the advance of medicine, older people are healthier than ever before. Also, today students are aware of the fact that their future depends on their success in studies. This means that they have a lot of obligations and responsibilities too.

And old people can also choose a life with only minor obligations and responsibilities. Actually they can live like young people. Older people have made their experiences. According to their experiences they have chosen how to live. They have all opportunities like young people plus experience. Young people have to spend their time to their education. They can't build a family for example. For most people having a family is still the most satisfying experience. Also they depend during their studies on the money of their parents. Older people however earn their own money. They have more money to spend and they can decide what to do with their money.

Another point is that enjoyment of life does not depend on age. The differences mentioned above are mainly dependant on the person. You can enjoy yeour life when you are young and you can enjoy zour life when you are old. Most things you can do in both stages, like meeting friends, visiting concerts and so on. The important thing is how you take life. You are always going to face problems whether you are young or old. The decisive things is how you cope with the problems.

      For example an electronic engineer can know how television works. But he/she knows only idea that how it works. I think this not important. In real life people dont pay attention ideas. People pay attetion facts. Because fact are real and applicable. People want to see something. People dont want hear only ideas. If they see facts then people pay attention ideas. And say ""Ooo it is a good idea,congratulations"".
     It is waste of time to learn ideas. If you learn fact you also learn ideas background of this fact. If we learn only ideas we must spend time to learn facts about this idea. But we learn facts directly we also learn the ideas. So we dont lose time. 
     Facts is general. So when you learn facts about something, you also learn ideas about this.

	First of all, when you travel on your own, you are free to go wherever you like. You can design your own tour according to your likings and interests. You can manage your time better. That will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the places you like better. Another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spendings according to your budget.

You should follow the tour guide and go the restaurants the guide determines as opposed to getting your own food. 
	For example, my husband and I planned an ""interrail"" trip in Europe couple years ago. It was all on our own. We planned in advance where, when, how, for how long we would go.

Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who wll not be restricted by location and weather.

When I was elementary  school student, I learned concept of insect. That was a first time that someone told me concept. I engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insect. This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant knowledge even I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insect.

715539.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"	I personnaly agree with this statement. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy, it is true. But let me tell you this; Albert Einstein has a quote: ""Knowledge is power."" which is completely true.
	Think of Biology without Chemistry; Chemistry without Physics; Physics without Geometry: Geometry without Math and so on... A chemist cannot explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without Physics, can he? Or a Physics master cannot measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lits it, can he?
	Another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know of even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago. Take Pascal as an example. He has a lot of proven theories in Math, Physics.. Isn't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored and made himself known of?
	The answer to these questions I pointed out are simple and true: The laws of nature, the languages spoken, people and all the others that we know of are on only one place: here on earth. No one can prove that the facts about it aren't linked to one another. The links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end, you will end up in finding yourself at the other.
	So, learning Physics, learning Chemistry, learning Literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about. You will find yourself at the other hand if you study hard and learn a lot.

662487.txt,P3,SPA,medium,"Well I'm not sure about this.
I think I agree because it looks obvious that nowadays, young people normally think more about theirselves, and do not really care about their communities, at least most of them.
They think it's more interesting to do something that will give them a benefit at the moment, or soon, and for sure, than expending time in something that will give a small benefit to other people, and just maybe.

But I also think that this is changing. Each day I can see more young people who care more about their community, and help, probably because their parents have a different mind than the parents of the young people before, and teach them in a different way that they have to help. Everyday I can see, for example, that they recicle, they dont throw trash to the floor, they care about politics and discuss them, etc. But I also think they are just habits, they dont really do it with the intention of helping the community. So, it's a good change because they help, but they still prefer to think more about theirselves.

I think that to make them really change and want to help their community, they have to be interested in it, so they take it as a personal benefit. To make this, the community should organize interesting excursions for young people who help the community, or some kind of grant. This way i'm sure that they will spend much more time in helping the community, while getting also benefits.

So my conclusion is that I agree and also that if we want to change this, the community should change in some way too.

The explosion of knowledge in incresing number of knolege fields make this question more provocative. I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer. The life experience and career of a person can support one answer and undermine the other answer.

Speciality is a relative concept in this case. Any career needs a certain degree of speciality in these days. You can not go to any field without having the necessary knowledge and skills, as well as attitudes, that compromise such field. I think that the question is related to the level of speciality that one needs. In other words how deep we need to go in the field of speciality. Another level of the issue is about wether this will isolte us from other fields, i.e ignoring horizental knowledge.

As a social worker, I think it is more empowering for me in my work and life to be of broad knowledge. Having broad knowledge will facilite my communication with different types of clients. When the client feels yuo  share with him or her a language he or she will build trust and feel nearer to you. Another reason for that stems from the ability of understding the environment of the case that may include different types of knowledge. This will save you from going every time to somebody to help you.

Another point that makes me oppose ignoring broad knowledge for the sake of more specializing is related to the personality of an individual. I think people who like to grow vertically in knowlege ignoring horizental growth will end up socially isolated wether they like or not.

Trying  news things certainly give a very good idea about what all things one is good in doing  .This statement of mine  confirms that I strongly agree the the fact the ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"".
Its easy  for  one to just follow the routine of his life ,like what he learned in the school ,from his house ,from this professional and keep following it to lead a normal life with out attempting to try something new .This happens mostly because many of them are sacred of unsuccessfulness by which I mean people are not ready to take defeat.
Such people don't belive in the qoute like""winning and lossing is not important ,its just that how you play the game"".

I personally agree that trying new things help you to become successful because trying can help you to learn all the other capabilities in one self for example some body took a job of pizza delivery for say various reason like sudden need of money ,droped out of college and while doing this job he learned that he know so much about the city that he can try to be  tourist guide.In doing so there is a big risk invole in giving up a well earning job to a somthing fairly new .But until unless he don't try it he will may never in his like be able to do anything else expect being a pizza delivery person.
 
secondly ,It help you to know how to deal with different situtation at different point of this.If one fail in his first attempt ,he know what all precaution he need to take incase he try to do the same thing next time.
 
One of the strong example I would like to mention at this point is ""Gandhi"".He was lawyer and could have kept on practicinghis profession but instead he took the risk of this life ,career ,social boundaries and steped into the Indian reveloution for freedom.And by the end of the all the event he became the most powerful leader of India and as regarded the same till now.

881421.txt,P5,DEU,medium,"According to the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today I think these statement is wrong.
In my opinion cars are the most important transportation vehicles in our society. In modern buisness flexibility is one of the most important things. Only the car allows everybody to carry distances at every time he wants to every place he needs. Public transportation systems have a lot of advantages especially in big cities whith only little space. In these cities most of the people are travelling everyday on the same route. But for longer distances public transportation systems are not flexibil enough.
Another argument for my opinion is that having a car makes life more easy. For example a car is very usefull if you go to the supermarket buying a lot of boxes of water or beer. It is impossible to carry these things by bike or by bus.
But one of the most important reasons is that people feel more independent when they have car. They are not dependent on other people ore public transportation systems. In my opinion people won't never give up these advantage unless they can not affort a car anymore.
For example I need my car nearly every day because my parents live in a small city which has hardly any public transportation system. There ar only few busses and they do not reach most of the places. I think public transportation systems are to exspensive for small areas or cities. But most of the people in my country live in small towns or villages. That's why a car is so necessary for a lot of people.
Of course cars cause a lot of problems, especially the enviromental polution.
But these problem can be solved by inventing new alternative technics. For example it is a good idea to resarch in hydrogen fuel or develop a fuel made of plants.
Because of all these reasons I do not aggree with the statement I'm asked about.

1071263.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"     I disagree with this opinion. I think, in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. I have some reason to think about that.

     First, some company of cars are now inventing new cars, like hibrid car, electric car something like that. Actually we can see that kind of cars on the road sometimes. We also interested in cars that are good for enviromental. Car industries will change the their way to sell the car to customers. Of course thought of customer for environment of earth will change in this few years.

     Second, I think that puclic translation is not convinient at country sides. For me, I am living in country side, I can not ride on the bus or train when I want. It is difference between the big cities like Tokyo and small city. So people who live in country side, they are using their own car now. I also use my own car. Number of cars in country sides more increased than before.    

     But the other hand, now gasoline is so expensive. If this situation will continue, number of cars may will dicrease.  I imagined that  reason. But, I think if costs of gasoline is expeinsive, bus company will change the time schedule not to move out. That is why, people will have to use their own car.

      Japanese company like Honda, Toyota is famous in many other countries. If they invent the new car that not to use the gasoline so much or something, it will spread up all over the world, and then many people will be able to think about enviroment of earth even if using the car. It is very good for us. We should accept that kind of project.

     That is why I disagree with this opinion.

	To improve your skills, carree, and knowledge, you have to challenge. The most person who successed are the person who do not fear failing. The person who fear failng can not challenge new things. I was that kind of person when i came to America. I did not try or challenge new things. I did not speak English at all because i was afread to fail and someone may laugh about my poor English. After few month, i realized i was wrong. In fact, although i live in America, my english were not improved at all. I started try adopting new culture and I recognized that how wnderful English is.I am sure that try new things are tough and it needs more power, but it will affect the person's life.  	
	I believe that tring new things is worth that taking high risk. Think about food company. If the food company stops to try inventing new food, people whould get bored about same food and the company would bankrupt. We have to keep tring every day in our life. That is the way how famous companies success have successed. 
	If you really want to success,do not afraid failing, and think about only improving yourself. The short cut to improve yourself is , of course, challenging new things.

1581339.txt,P8,FRA,medium,"According to my point of view, sucessful people try new things and are likely to take more risk.

The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal, he wants to have something new and more difficult to do. Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succed in something, he will always want more.
Alpinists, for exemple, don't usally stop climbing after they managed to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other montain, harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conquerant didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finaly defeated. And I think because he was sucessful in a first time, he couldn't get rid of his will of power.

An other reason would be the fact that sucessful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can  take the exemple of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozen of world  championships. Well, he is now looking forward to become a forula one driver. Because he wants something new. Something that gives him the opportunity to achive a other great goal.

A last important factor is, according to me, the fact that when somebody managed to win something, or to earn something, he would probably want to get more of it. No matter if it is money, glory or power. The joy of winning might even be more important than the profit whitch came with this success. A good exemple would be a poker player or a gambler. After winning some money, they would probably bet more of it. And it is actualy dificult to get rid of this circle.

Second, advertisement is the only one way that people will know about new product.  For exemple, when the company wants to send the new product  on the market ,it use advertisement. appearently the company wants to incite people for buying its product that is why it will make it unbelievabely on the advertisement in order to make people think that this product is so good.

And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts. I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from the text books. To understand the basic idea is not simply but, in my opinion, it can expand student's abilities of thinking and creation.

     Understanding new ideas and concepts can take long time and sometimes it could take few decades for students. It can be problem to learning new things. That's why some instructor and students take shortcut to learn new things. For example, when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio, so called 'Golden ratio' which is believed as perfect proportion for every object. It is very difficult theory to understand for specially freshman and it could take more than 2years, but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory.

    Even though difficultes to understand the ideas, students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it. It can be easy to creat new things with the basic concepts. For instance, a musician who understand the principle of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and lythm using the basic music element. 

  Consequently, I recommend to understand the main ideas when students learn new thing.

When we are young we are usually happier, but, sadly, that is caused by ignorance and a lack of responsability. For example, people who are around 20 years old could seem to be happier than people over 30, but that doesn't mean that there are no complications in the younger way of life. When people are over 30 they are very likely to have been through the challenges in life that define a person and make him or her to be called an adult. Also, It could be very stressing to be an adolescent or even a kid, with all of those things that you need to survive to be able to call yourself a grown man or a woman. 
Older people seem to be less fun I suppose. But that is not the rule. There's no need for us to expect that every grown up is boring and not funny. I believe that if people can find a way not to lose that spark they had when they were younger it could be a fun way of living for sure. I can see that life could become more and more enjoyable as we grow up, and I bet that it is going to stay that way as my yet young life spans into the future.

Everyone keeps a unic opinion on it. While it comes to me, I would say that to be a professor is more beneficial.
    First of all, people should save their energy from obtaining knowledge from all categories of fields, which does good to our advanced education. Energy, just like time for human, is limited. With these limited energy, one can do what he or she likes to do. But, once distributed to too many subjected, people can't be a professor in a certain field. For example, we know that teachers in the elemental school can teach almost all the courses that are provided. However, if the child grows up and enter a college, no one can be responsible for all the classes. What he or she need is a professor who know a lot in a particular subject, not a teacher with many knowledge from different subjects.
    In addition, people with a great number of knowledge in some special field help solve the social problems. Take the development of science reseaches for an example. Without the technology brought by science research, we can't live such comfortable lives today, we will still suffer from the deseases, hungry and disasters. Without science researches, we can't explain nature phenomenons and the secret of the universe. Nevertheless, who are mostly responsible for these researches?

1- as we know that cars moves depending on fule (petrol) and we know very clearly that the word source of fule is decraesing also which will lead to the highly increase of oil, and that will lead to a high increase on the cost of cars and as we know that world income and people income can not afford it, and it will be much more cheaper for exaple to use a picycle or train for example.

429189.txt,P1,TEL,medium,"	The topic in disguise deals with, a person being generalist or a specialist.A generalist is a perosn who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects.A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge in one subject.
              I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject. A person with  broad knowledge in many subjects, a generalist, can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject.So he can deal with any of the subjects.Where as a person with deep knowledge about a single subject cannot deal with different subjects as he has no idea about other subjects. It is must to have knowledge of all the subjects to get through the exams and attain grades. Even in case of getting a job, a generalist has more chances of getting a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal any kind of subject that is given to him. Where as a specialist has to keep mum when asked about any other subject. The companies would definately require a multi-talented person rather than a person who has great talent in a single subject.
             ""As every coin has two sides"".We cannot always say that having broad knowledge is vital.Hence there is a  saying ""Jack of all trades but master in none"".A multi talented person with no deep knowledge in any subject cannot acheive success all the time.
Knowledge in depth is required when it comes to certain areas of science such as astronomy,medicine etc. In these areas a person cannot sustain with vauge knowledge. It is crucial for a person to have knowledge in depth. Else these proffesions would turn out to be disasters. 
	Hence what I would like to conclude is, a person must have  minimum knowldge about all the academic subjects and must excel in one atleast to acheive success.
","The topic in disguise deals with, a person being generalist or a specialist. A generalist is a person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects. A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge of one subject. I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject. A person with broad knowledge in many subjects, a generalist, can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject. So he can deal with any of the subjects. Where as a person with deep knowledge about a single subject cannot deal with different subjects as he has no idea about other subjects. It is must to have knowledge of all the subjects to get through the exams and attain grades. Even in the case of getting a job, a generalist has more chances of getting a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal with any kind of subject that is given to him. Where as a specialist has to keep mum when asked about any other subject. The companies would definitely require a multi-talented person rather than a person who has great talent in a single subject. ""As every coin has two sides"". We cannot always say that having broad knowledge is vital. Hence there is a saying ""Jack of all trades but master of none"". A multi-talented person with no deep knowledge of any subject cannot achieve success all the time. Knowledge in depth is required when it comes to certain areas of science such as astronomy,medicine etc. In these areas a person cannot sustain with vagueknowledge. It is crucial for a person to have knowledge in depth. Else these professions would turn out to be disasters. Hence what I would like to conclude is, a person must have at least some knowledge of all the academic subjects and must excel in one atleast to achievesuccess. "
1075656.txt,P2,ARA,medium,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there is so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagrreing with such opinoin

First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on persom's character rather than his age.Some people prefer sedintary life style ,like working ,going home ,watcing TV.etc .These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimum as possible.
Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably becuase mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work.Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find someting they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with freinds,etc.

Second ,which is also a point to take into consideration is the surrounding enviorment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller commuunities where there is not much going on in their small town.Nevertheless it depend on where did the person grow up ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alke or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact  small city for whatever reason is ,he may not know what to do there.

Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of  the person finding the appropiate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to adapot to the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to the same kind of things that he is used to do.

Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives. In a way positively impacted us by being able to find a lot of things on the internet and make it easier for all ages to find things they would like.In another way it negatively a many people's lifes as they tend to just sit in front of the computer searching internet,playing games and more or less they end up with sedintary ,lkind of lazy and unhealthy life style
So, to sum up, anyone of any age in my opinion can enjoy life and I would not agree with the saying that youmg people are able to enjoy life more than olders do as I mentioned it depends on the person's character and willings to enjoy life and this can make him adapot to any of the changes I mentioned in my examples ,like moving to a different or a smaller city ,getting older or any other factor .It all comes back that peson and how he or she is willing to be part of his community ,and to enjoy his life.

A younger person can work late nights and will finish the project no matter what come in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world.
            The older people have mind that are worn out, by age , by time. Whereas a younger mind have lot of ideas to offer. These are fresh brains, that have come right from college, filled with all sorts of  new tools and the virgour to put those tools to action.And also there is no burden of a family to support. A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife, his chilldren, his home ............. , this list can go endless. 
   Above all the dating of girl, gives you so,divine a feeling that hardly can be expressed by words.

Young have many goals that they want to achieve, for example they want to achieve good education, high position.

834700.txt,P3,SPA,medium,"Currently, there are more people who help the others than before. At the beginning of the century my country suffered a civil war. People had big problems and they only tried to survive. They did not want to solve the problems of the others, they only wanted to eat and to care their families.

However, right now, all the people do not have big problems and they are more implicated with their communities. In my personal expericence I could explain these arguments with several examples.

When I was young, my teachers at highschool encouraged students to help other people in their subjects, even if that students were in an other school. I felt very well because I coul help a lot of people who do not know how to speak or how to write. I remeber two girls that they were 8 years old and they didnt know how to read. I helped them twice a week during for years and they finally learn not only how to read, but also how to write. 

Furthermore, when I was at the university, I created with my friends one organitation that prepare conferences in order to obtain money for poor people. We could collected a lot of money by doing these conferences. 

On the other hand, right now, I usually go to the church in order to serve food for the people who do not have nothing to eat. More or less I often go to the church once a week.

In my view, the people are more implicate in their communities than they are before. The society has changed because If someone explain in an interview for finding a job that he helps in his community, he probably be hired because all the companies wants honesty in their organisations.

For example, will be machines that can go over the earth and watter and flight into the air, and everyone can have one, because the cost to manufacture will be lower.

However, The perspective that I have of the future is a little negative, the industry grows really quickly, and technology helps in the development of the world, but it also helps in the destruction. The wants and needs of the people change, they want to have more electronic things to have an easier life. Also the time will be precious in the future, and they will need to have a car to go to jobs and meetings in a fast way. That is why I believe that there will be more cars in the future. Finally, if in the future there will be more cars, I can help in the construction of this transportation, and that will be something that does not damage the world. I am an industrial designer, therefore, my work is creating a positive perspective of the future and designing positive things that help the needs of the people in the future. "

For example cannot everybody remebres his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would have never allowed or something like that?
And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels?

How many times we have bought an article, thinking that it's in a particular way or it does particular things while it's actually very different!! And what a disappointment!! I get really angry when it happens to me. For example, when I was a little child I saw on TV a really fantastic little robot which did  (which would have done) a lot of things, such as bringing glasses as a waiter, going alone around the room, recording my voice and playing CDs and so on.

On top of that, I think people who can understand ideas and concepts are also love in society because they can solve problems quickly.

Students have to understand the main ideas and concepts on the one hand, but have to learn the facts aswell.
If students understand an idea, they should be able to work the facts out in any case they need them, but only if they know some facts.

When a student only learns the facts he will later only know them and might lose the view for the whole topic and thus not being able to anwer the question. He might lose himself in details. It is important to learn the facts aswell as the general idea, because you cannot answer a question without having any facts at hand. 
In case a student only learns the general idea and forgets to learn the facts he opposes the problem of not being able to answer a qouestion once again. He might have understood the whole thing, but is not able to present certain facts that are necessary for explaining a specific topic. Therefore an answer won't be possible.
When a student has learned aswell the general idea and concepts as the facts he should be able to answer every question on a certain topic, without greater problems concerning his preparation. he might have other problems, but they are not to be discussed here.

In my past school time I generally learned the facts but sometimes it occurred that I hadn't understood the whole idea and concept and therefore a classtest was really bad. If I only had understood the main ideas and concepts but hand't learned the facts I wasn't usually not able to answer quoestions according to the given task. When I had understood the ideas and concepts and had learned the facts, the classtest wasn't a big deal. So I have experienced just what I have stated above. Serveral friends of mine have experienced something quite similar. Bad grades when they had either only learned the facts or ideas and concepts - good grades when having learned and understood both.

Thus it is most important for the students to learn  the general idea and concepts aswell as to learn the important facts concerning the topic.

However, he has to learn the new upcoming softwares like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB.NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks for that courses.

I believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than fact is the best way to suceed. Learning facts are very hard keep becasue you could forget them over time, Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments, And finally students skills could be enhance.

It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions of your test of history. But you could forget it after few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the a battle started, what were the conditions after the battle finished, and son on. It could be in your brain longer than learning facts.

Undestanding concept could be valuable when you are studying a different topic. For example, the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict. On the other hand, if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even, maybe you have to study againg for your business or your geography class.

Students could develop better skills if the learn concepts and ideas. They could argue for example, why the battle happened, or even learn that war conflict are not the best way to thrive. They could even interested and pursue a carer in history. I think Learning concepts and ideas from a topic, give you many opportunities fot your future life.

For all these reason, I support the statement that students should learn ideas and concepts rather that facts. It imprive their skills, help them to other subjects and enhance their skills.

                  Because it is more important for any one to  have an clear idea about that particular thing to work on it.
                  I would explain with an example,when i am doing my first semester of my  under graduation i use to do my assignments with out understanding them and with out any clear idea about the topic given.i use to submit my assignments in this way only .when my examination is nearing,i dont have any idea about the topics because i didn't work on them clearly. Because,i thought just submitting my assignments in time would help me in the examination,but when i appear in the exam i could not do well because i dont have any idea of  the concept of the work.this makes my grades to be lower.
                 when the next  assignment is given i used to work on it for a long time and tried to get a clear idea about the topic and made my assignments.this helped me a lot in the final examination to succeed and got a better grade.this is because understanding the concept of that made me to do well in the examination.
                Another example is  that,when an experiment is explained in an class room it is again asked to make the same one in laboratory.i used  to neglet to concentrate on the laboratory  class.when i used to revise the topics  covered after so many days, i used to forget the particular thing expalined in the class room and i again should see the particular professor for the left over one.If i would have performed the paritcular thing in the laboratory i would get the clear idea and the concept of the topic and would have remembered the thing in that topic.

He felt that he was putting his future at stake if he would carry on helping his community and he was not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in times when he would be in crisis.

1480023.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"The issue at hand is whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. It is an important problem, since it will affect humankind's quality of life, exspecially if cars will continue to use polluting fuels. In my opinion there hardly be fewer cars in use than today. On the contrary, I believe that the number of cars will esponentially encrease.

One reason I think that cars will grow in number is that I am not acquainted with any effective policy to make cars decrease. Of course there have been many attemps not to make people use their cars (such as taxation to enter the downtown), but any decision have not been made to stop definitely the production of cars. This would probably be harmful to many countries' echonomical systems, and would mean the end of many car companies.

Another reason I believe that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years, especially polluting cars, is that the number of cars is related to petrol business. As everyone may know, petrol business is one of the greatest in the world and it provides great financial gains to the ""petrol masters"", who have a certain political influence. Unless ""petrol master"" will renaunce to their incomes, there will never be any effective decision to make cars decrease.

The last reason I think that cars will not decrese is that nowadays there are many countries in the middle of an economical boom, and their populations, in order to satisfy their increasing need of comforts, are buying cars. For example just think of China. Its huge population on one hand is getting richer and richer, on the other hand is asking for a larger number of cars to be produced, since it needs them.

Ultimately I think that it is almost impossible that there will be fewer  cars in the next twenty years. Of course this is not the best option for Earth's life, nevertheless there are not the right conditions to get a better one.

In this respect, if scientists study cars which do not pollute and use natural resources and spread out all over the world, we will try to use cars much more than use public transportation. In conclusion, I disagree that In twenty years there will be fewer cars than today for the reasons that I mentioned above. To live a much more convenient life and the development of technology will influence the increase in cars after twenty years. "

I believe most of these advertisements make products seem better because they only talk about good things about their products and also they use attracting things, such as people, to fascinate people.
	Since advertisements only show benefits of that product, it seems much attractive to people. For example, my mother wanted to by a new vaccum. When she was wathching TV show, there was a commercial about new vaccum. It said "" this is really powerful and useful! You should buy one!!"" or that sort of things. My mother was fascinated by that and next day, she went to the store and bought one. When she used it, she was really shocked. Although it was really powerful, it made really loud noise and exhale stinct air. She was really mad that the advertisement did not say anything about the noise.
	Also since advertisements are to attract people, they try to make those nicer, which result to make products seem much better than they really are. For example, there was a new kind of CD player when I was 12 years old. I did not want to buy it since I had one already. However, I saw a commercial about it on TV and my favorate actoress was advertising it! And it seemed for me it is really cool to have it and I if I had it, it would make me prettier. Next day, I run to the store and boughr it. However, it was really useless and it looks more plastic than the one that actress had. Therefore I have never used it before.

	In my point of view, advertisements really works well for those who make the business, it motivates cunsumer to purchase on their items, but if we take a close look at some commercials on the TV, their always presenting you the positive side of their products, instead of the things that have left behind, for example, we often see some shampoo commercials on TV, using those ladys with long hair showing you that if you use this brand of shampoo you will have the same shining hair as the lady have on the commercials. This obviously is not true, on the TV they are putting on some chemicals that make their hair look smoothly and shining, but not the really affect that cused by the real product that they persuade the consumer to buy.

This is because of some simpel reasons. It might be better for a student to learn facts, dates and results because thats the teacher askes for. But in real life, this means the life after school, the time you need to work for your money to survive, it is better to undestand things. A person not able to understand what she or he is doing is not able to develop an idea to find mistakes and eliminate them. 
A person who is able to do this would be much more succesful in her/his job, just because of being able to make the way of working more effective. 
In school this kind of understanding and finding solutions on problems should be teached.
Another point of why a theme should be understood is because of fun. Fun motivates to go on, to do more. For some persones it might be perfect to lern by haert, but most of them get bored. The more effective way is to support the wish of people to understand (who deos not know the most frequently asked question of a child:""Why?"").

All the products have to have an advertisement, but sometimes this kind of ads only show the common rules that all the products must have.

In my opinion advertisments must show the true composition of the product, no matter if it significate a major cost for the company who produce this kind of products. Advertisments are very important because they show us if that product is correct or no for our consume.

I agree with most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are, some Products show qualities that aren't true when you consume it, the only thing that they concern its sell their products no matter if it is so good or no.

They try to hide some details, and that details can be harmful for some people. A lot of peolple can't consume some ingredients, for example a diabetic person shouldn't taste sugar, but if an advertisment don't show the quantity of sugar that the product have, this product is harmful for that person, even can cause an intoxication.

So the people wonder how the picture of a product become better of their looking than it really is.

Apart form the wrong advertisement, almost all ones make product seem much better than they really are.  

Second, I have the experience of buying a product by being derived by the advirtisement. I bought a PC, but it was not the one I wanted. This shows that the looks of the product that I saw at the TV program was different from the real one. This is the way to sell a product, and it is the real role of advertisement.   

Third, as I mentioned, some people may believe that TV programs and pictures image the real aspect of a product. However it is false. In the process of making advertisement, makers use several kinds of scientific methods in order to make custermers believe that the product is realy good. That is, they change apearrence of the product, and give us the good impression on it. By using the effet, like visional effect, the maker make the unreal image of the product.

	Companies make their products seem much better than they really are to an extent that they create an illusion in the consumer's mind by playing on his emotions and feelings. They create an idea through the advertisement into the consumer's mind that their product is the answer for his problems.  
	
	Excessive competetive advertisements makes a lot of distraction in consumers' minds which obliges companies to make their product seem much better than they really are and to an extent of making their product better than all of the other competetive products; in other words to make their product ""The Unique Product"".

The main reason for advertisment is to sell their product on the market. They want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product. Advertisment should not only emphasizes the goodness of their product, furthermore it stresses a character given by the advertisment. For example, when there is a company advertising for entertaining things like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisment during the commercial breaks. It is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisment is correct or not, the only important thing is that they get the people's attention and may achieve interest to watch their show. The only thing advertisment does so is because of money. Money rules the world. And so the company is not afraid to illusion people.  Next to the obvious reason that the company wants people to buy their products first of all, is that mayby their product is not so good that people would buy it. In turn, they have to improve the image or quality of their product. This makes a product seem better although it might be worse.
On the other hand lots of people have already made a lot of experiences with some advertisment and their promises years ago. Moreover, they got to know that most of all the advertisment is much better than the product in reality. This experience made people more sceptical. But how should people know if the advertised product is for real worse than the advertisment promised or if it is maybe exactly like that or even better? They have to test it. And therefore they spend some money. Maybe they test it just one time, but they do it and that's exactly what's the purpose for an advertisment.

  First of all, human beings are the animal that full of desires. We want ourselves to be respected and popular among others, so we usually willing to pay to help us make that target. For example, most of us using shampoo to wash our hair everyday, and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner. Yet, is that true?

However ,sometimes we could argue that enhancing the reality of a product in order to achieve good results and sell more of it remains strongly unethical. 
The first reason why advertisers should not make the product they are selling seem much better than it really is, is simply because they will not attract consumers on the long run. Indeed consumers might try the product once but  if their expectations are not fully satisfied according to what they saw in the advertising, they will not repeat the buying process. 
In the same way, by doing so ,consumers will lose faith in the brand which is advertising . As a result they will turn toward more reliable companies and products. This could have a very negative impact on the companie's results.

However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specialize in one specific subject.

For instence, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good in, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save much time for the scienct student to study a lot on the history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specialize in one specific subject can save much time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spended on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better.
	Not only the information are going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future. In order to get into a good company or create a good company.  People do not need all the subjects to do this. The only thing is the strong strenth you have over the others. For example, a good program writer's nesscery skill is to write program. He/she do not need to know Zoology well to do so, so why should he/she bother studying it if the sociey only need one strong strength per person. Strong strength is what a good company is searching for.
	Furthermore, specialize in a subject for a student can also benifit societies  and the world. Inventions make the lives better for people, such as the internet search information and medicine prolong lives.

	Studying in one specific area is better than to have a broad education because it saves a lot of time, gives a person better chance of getting a good work and also benfits the lives of the others.

He/she does not need to know Zoology well to do so, so why should he/she bother studying it if society only needs one strong strength per person. Strong strength is what a good company is searching for. Furthermore, specializing in a subject for a student can also benefit society and the world. Inventions make the lives better for people, such as the internet search engine and medicine prolong lives. People should specialize in one subject in order to make a good invention to help the people. Thus, specialized in one area does not only help individuals, but also helps society and other people. Studying in one specific area is better than having a broad education because it saves a lot of time, gives a person a better chance of getting a good job and also benefits the lives of others. In conclusion, people should strive as hard as they can in a subject in order to help themselves and the world. "
1481375.txt,P1,FRA,medium,"Nowadays, there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects. Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects, I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it.

First, when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic, he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth. These issues are often complex, and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable. As a result, it is possible to take position on debated issues. For instance, I have studied psychology for many years and in my country, different types of psychology are debated now. Having this deep knowledge in this particular field, I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion. Also I can stand a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue.

In addition, I think that if I know very well one subject, it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects. As everything is related, it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways. And I believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permits to approach better very complex issues. For example, early this year, the governement of my country wanted to rule a law involving changes in the social system. Since I had experience in this field, it was easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker point of view, but I also enjoyed getting very interested in other points of views as legal or economic points of view. I was all the more interested by the subject that I feel very involved.

From this, you can understand why I prefer to build for myself a sizeable knowledge on one specific subject. Owing to this, I can take position to complex issues, and consequently I get very interested in some subjects. This strong interest permits me to open my mind to new topics with a lot of curiosity.

I totally disagree with the statement because i think that when you try to know more about everything you just can't because is too much information from diferent topics and your brain can't support as many information as you want. For example when i was a little girl for about four moths I tried to memorize all the math operations even if a couldn't make them there was always a calculator but after that I got confused with everything because I couldn't recognize the operations anymore. I'm not sure if it was becuase I forgot or I didn't practice but I wasn't able to make them, not even with calculator. After that I started with my normal class some things were familiar but all my effort of doing all those math problems and graphs and everything didn't have any result. Whatsmore I realized that in my ambition of knowing everything I lost a whole vacation full with fun and distractions. 
Therefore i never tried again to learned everything from one step. I go step by step instead of jumping. And now that I'm just to start a new part of my life I know that everything comes at its' moment and that knowing to many things can distract you from what you really want for your life. I'm not saying that you have to be an ignorant or like a pony that is not able to see the sides and just looks the road, what I mean is that you have to be focused on what you are doing and on what you want so when it comes the time to show your knowlege you are sure and you don't hesitate.

This has been happening in the 1960's when the hippie movement was on their peak.

This means that up from then the people begin to think about the consequences of using a car and particulary using a car for movement for which a car isn't necessary.

They recognize the impact of the using a car for the environment, for example they receive that the high use of pollutant like cars can be harmful for the ozon lawyer.

The turnover of conduct and so the try to treat the environment more carefully  can be also found in many politcial strategies or in new laws for protecting the environment. But in my opinion this changed thinking can be only found in industrialized countries like in the United states or in Germany. Most of the far east continents like Asia are the contrary. At this time they are getting through their industralizing process. There the car use will be increse for the next twenty years.

I think it`s possible that, beacause of the problems related with the decrease of petroleum reserves and the rise of gas cost, cars will change and they will use some alternative resources to function;
 Biological and refreshable resources like wind, Sun or hydrogen are the future of the transport problem but today I think they are only a future far from us.
The thing that is also possible is that the way to use cars change. Today we see al lot of cars in every roads that contains only one person. For example there are often a lot of cars that are obliged to go very slow beacause there are more cars then a street could contain;i take the bus every day to go to the university and I know very well this bad situation. A way to change this think is to use more public services, like bus or train, but I know that they do not work very well so people prefer to take the car.
One other way to change this is to organize people to have cars full of them and not with only the driver.

First of all, advertisements increase the curiosity of people especially if it is for women.Assume that a woman watching the TV, who loves chocolate  and sees the commercial on the television which has the mother seeing her son and her husband as a bar of chocolate and wants to get a bite of them, the woman watching the commercial will give be curious of the product and will give a try.It is obvious that she won't be the only one so this will give a chance for that product to take place on the market shelf.It will be the consumers own decision to keep it there or ignore it on the next visit.

The second thing is that women are the best customers all around the world. It may not be the man who would like to give a try if he won't see the product right after he sees the advertisement but a woman can keep it in mind in the syber shopping list and that list appears when it comes to shopping and she picks up the product and give a try.For example, if it is a man who is in the market to get a pack of coffe he most probable picks up the package of coffee he is used to but if it is the woman she gets her regular coffe with the one she saw on the board on her way to the mall.

The third one is colourful and well prepared advertisements.A car you would never ask for may look like a Ferrari for you in a well prepared commercial and you may go ahead and see it in the store.The minute you step in the store the staff in there takes the control and does anything for you to b interested in that car.

Finally,I believe that the right way of advertising the product will take it's place in the market.The only thing is that the manifucturer needs to follow three points, to have a good advertisement to make people feel curious about, to have woman on the advertisement to make people look at it and to have colorful advertisement to make people expect something out of that.

However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reason which can prove and give more example for my persanal opinion.
      The most importand reason I think is that advertisements know what comsumer thinking when comsumver are shopping. The outside of looking of products is most point people will think to buy the products. Therefore the advertisements speand more time to design what kind of looking of better for  prodcuts then the time which they are design inside of products. This points can help counpany to get more money because they dont have to spand too much time on inside of products design, and cumsumer feel interesting on products looing, so they buy it.
     Producing inside of products easier then making the good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a  research paper which is about disguessing how many times people usually  spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that design a new car engige should speed more then five years at lessest. Because it has too many thing need to do for it, and sometime it has some techengle gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compare with design inside. Therefore, most off time the products seem much better than they really are.
      Third, people usually care about the inside quility after they bought it. The thing for people to deside buy or not usually is outside looking. So people will complain the products when they bough it. However, in this point the company give cumsuners' money alreay.

Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are. Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it. The thing for people to decide whether to buy or not is usually outside looking. So people will complain about the products when they buy them. However, at this point the company gives customers ' money already. "
726015.txt,P5,TEL,medium,"  I do not agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer usage of cars than there are today.

  I dont agree with this because, firstly,when the technology is increasing there will be more cars in use than they are today.with the increasing technology we can have cars which seem same as being in our home.now-a-days we are getting formula1 cars which are the fastest cars in the world.as the saying goes""increase in technology will increase the world in many ways"".cars are also in the same way,with the increase in technology the technology of cars will also be increased rather than becoming fewer in coming years.

  Secondly,now-a-days each and every person is prefering to have a car because it is a best as well as convinient way to go in a car rather than going in buses and trains.because they may consume a lot of time waiting for all the people who are travelling at that time to come.but when this is compared  to cars we dont need to wait because we have our own car to travel.

  Thirdly, as petroleum is decreasing day-by-day,we may say that cars will become fewer in use than they are today,but technology is now inventing cars which run by gases for example,gases which we use for cooking etc,.by this we can say that cars can also be run without petroleum and can be run with gases either.so this will also not affect for cars becoming fewer in the upcoming years.  

   So i conclude by saying that cars will not become fewer in use than they are today with the above stated reasons.the usage of cars will increase rather than decrease in the coming years.

No try new thing means  no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remind the pastor Cho' story  who established the  full gospel church in Seoul.

God gave  the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 number. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it.  It was big risks. It might be worse if it influeced toward his church numbers because all elders of church number were not agree with his opinion. 
However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harship for new  church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers becuase the location the church was bulit, became the core of city of seoul. All so important building such as the building  the national broad casting and govenment, were established there. 

The other reason is that all most people try to do  what he or she knew well. That means that there are so competitive in that area. If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others, it is rare to get success. Let's think about one example. 
There are a lot of Pizzah store in our area. many of us know how to make it. it is also not much risks for managing compnay because it is famillar for each of us. However,it is easy to make it as well as to be known how to do it.

       Firs, if one person doesn't want to give his enough time to help other people that means he is selffish. I jointed a interview process and new hired people training of my company. In my opinion,If there are two people at the siminar work position. The better man always be the one who pay more time to help other people. The God always helps the one who loves help other people. The one who loves pay more time to help people. He will get the feedback of others. You never know when will other people feedback your help.

Some people help me to get interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Give enough time to helping communtites not only gives me peace, lovely feeling but also give me wild view to see the world.

      Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becomes biger and biger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich person affrid to be hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child well education. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities? Give the poor person help to educate, get work and resept. We will not have much more public problem. Moreover we will feel happy and lovely.

       According these two reasons, I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping communities. Young people are like sponge. What you teach them what you earn. Moreover young people have to study and they have ability to care other communities. Give enough time to helping communtites is a win-win solution to makes our world better and lovely.

An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but  having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding to that market.

	There is a backgroung behind a product, and behing a company. The product that is already at sale has an enormous study before getting to the store. Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time passes througth, by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about.

	The best way to sell could be by improving your product just with very tiny changes like to make the product wantable, but not changing the product, just making people interested, curious and this will make people buy the product, this is a great way of doing a sell.

of course I have travel with a guide tour too but when this happen the guide tour is always under presion of the  time and you need to follow him all time and if you want to stop some times you can't and I don't know but I don't like to have tour guide.
  in  other hand when I travel without tour guide I can stop wherever I want and I can do wherever i want , and if I do not know what places are the famouses of the city I can ask to the people who live in that place or i can go to a library and look in the internet the direction and then get a map and then I am ready to go wherever I want thus it is so funny because if I get lost I need to ask how to return and at the same time that I know the city I know more people. I know that it is a risk, because for example my friends an I are going to travel next weekend to Quertaro  to visit some friends well they are members of my church, but I  never have  been there and no body that know how to arrrive to the city wants to come with us , so we decided to take the risk and  we only have the map, the car and money, well I want to tell you that  some times I feel afear to get lost or something like that but something inside of my is telling my ""you can do whatever you want"" ( and I know that voice is Good, and........he is going to care me). so we decided that we will travel without tour guide.

in conclution despite is too risky travel without tour guide it is better because is too funny and you can learn of your mistakes.

It is considered as in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there were today. This statement may become true or false, because it is a guess but why people believed in that guess or not. 
First of all I strongly believed in that statement. As the time pass, transportation and different ways of transporting is being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, w'th the increased numbers in cars increases demand in fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is a fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to transport by bus by subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because by improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway. It is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling. On the other hand people choices will change while travelling along the cities; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropol city to a touristic city of Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car. Because for making another guess; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all. Time is a valuable thing now; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay the plane ticket for not being late for the life. 
In all these respects above; transportation will see great changes in the aspect of the people lives. These changes will be rooted from the improvements in the transportation vehicles and economic conditions for instance in the fuel oil people faced. As a result for making a guess ""In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today""

Not one thing was different or special except the nice smell. I've been using it for few years now, but still, nothing seems to happen.

426980.txt,P7,HIN,medium,"I am agree with the given statement.According to day to day experience as a student I can say, it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

Firstly, lets elaborate it by citing an example.In maths subject there are few facts, based on which a student has to do sum.But is that possible that only by learning the facts the student will be able to solve a given sum.untill a student donot understand the concept of solving proper type of sum, he will stuck up with the sum.By only learning maths facts student will be able to solve only a particular type of sum.If he has not understood the concept of solving it, he will not be able to solve the same kind of sum if the sum is slightly twisted.

secondly, if a student doesnot understand any subject and just mug up the facts of the subject, he will not be able to retain it for long.It is a proved fact, that the things which are understood are more retentive than the things which are just mugged up.By understanding any topic of a subject a student can use it more practically.

Thirdly,lets consider medical students.If a medical student just learn the facts about human body and donot understand it, he can do big mistakes and it will be a question of life and death. If he has not understood human body and just learned the facts,whenever he will find a slightly differnt disease, he will not be able to prescribe any medicine.Because he might couldnot have learnt the desease exactly the same way.But by understanding he can make out that it is just a slight different menefestation of the same desease.

Old people do not enjoy their life like young people because of age.
Some old people think that during their youghts they  enjoyed their time and believes that the remaining of their life should be devoted to their children.Therefore, their main concern is to see their children's improvement from childhood to adulthood.Thus, old people think that their role is to serve their children at the expense of their enjoyment.

1476017.txt,P7,SPA,medium,"	In my opinion , it is more important for students to undersantd ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. There are several reasons why I agree with this statement.
	First, I think that understanding an idea and a concepts is the first step to learn something new. For example, if you do not know the concept of ""evaporation"" how are you going to know the ""process of raining"" or maybe understand some chemical procress that involve the concept ""evaporation"".
	Secondly, I agree that student must know every concepts of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challegens without knowing the fact. For example, if a student know the concept of ""bowling something"" ,them it is would be easier for he to cook something by just following the instruction.
 	Finally, I support this thanks to a personal experience I had lived. Last year, whem I was in high school, I had to take a science test and I studied hard for it. Whem I started to asked it I stoped at the most important question and did not know how to answer it  because of my lack of knowlegde in some sciencetific concepts.
	To sum up, I believe that students must focus on learning all the concepts the can and then worry on learning facts because everything goes steps by steps and the first step here to learn a new fact, is first getting the ideas and the concepts of every new words. Therefore, they would have the skills to learn more than students think they could do without knowning the concept.

First, I think that understanding an idea and a concept is the first step to learning something new. For example, if you do not know the concept of ""evaporation"" how are you going to know the ""process of raining"" or maybe understand some chemical process that involves the concept of ""evaporation"". Secondly, I agree that students must know every concept of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challenges without knowing the facts. For example, if a student knows the concept of ""bowling something"" , then it would be easier for him to cook something by just following the instruction. Finally, I support this thanks to a personal experience I had. Last year, when I was in high school, I had to take a science test and I studied hard for it. What I started to ask was I stopped at the most important question and did not know how to answer it because of my lack of knowledge of some scientific concepts. To sum up, I believe that students must focus on learning all the concepts they can and then worry about learning facts because everything goes steps by steps and the first step here to learn a new fact, is first getting the ideas and the concepts of every new word . Therefore, they would have the skills to learn more than students think they could do without knowing the concept. "
614943.txt,P2,DEU,medium,"In the following essay I shall be concerned with the question whether young people enjoy life more than older people do.

Generally, I agree with this statement but there are some exceptions and remarkable points to be acknowledged before taking a too fast conclusion.
In my case, I'm 25 years old and I'm enjoying my life very well. Im going out on the night, taking long travels in the holidays and other time- and breathtaking hobbies, which are a giving a me a kind of resting and relaxing besides my work. For doing so, you need the time and a special sense of personal feeling.
Taking all of these examples in contradiction to my parents or my grandparents, which are much older than me, for sure, I'm able to do go out very often during the week, visiting some bars and a disco afterwards and do not suffer on the next day although if I spent the night in the city till dawn. In my opinion, this point of suffering will be compareable in some sports situations. For me, sport is my life and I cannot imagine to live without it. Therefore, I'm studying Sports Science and I did several disciplines throughout my lifetime in a way my parents, respectively my grandparents weren't, and especially now aren't able to match. But these two examples are based on the personal constitution of the human body, which is unique and also changing during everybodys life. 
So, it should be remarked, that both of my grandparents and their heirs have different things to enjoy their life, none of which I can imagine to like or to spend many hours by doing them. Nevertheless, all of those fulfilled them with happyness and make them enjoying their life. 
Finally, I think that a basic solution of this question is based whether you are can understand everybodys way how to fulfill and to enjoy his life during the different ages.

However, I do not agree the opinion and think that people getting a specialized knowledge will be beneficial to our society as follow reasons.    

     To begin with, our society ,recently, should get the human resources getting a specialized knowledge in many areas such as technology, economy and policy. Because unprofessional people can lead the society - country, company, party etc. - to the miserable status. The negative results of companies operated by unprofessional owners can be a good sample. For example the Korean famous corporation 'Daewoo' got the bankruptcy some years ago, because the owner ignore the advice of professional staffs.    

     At seccondly, the modern society has expanded its area. So the society has been detailed and needs the people suitable for each area. Especially, the modern corporations have so much departments for improving the efficiency. For example, most companies divede the department such as administration, accounting, human resources, general support and production.
In this case, companies should employee people who can use the specialized knowledge.

    At third, if necessary, there are other ways to grow broad knowledge after becoming the specialist in specific area. The community activity and interaction with people in other area will be effective way. So many companies hire specialists and give them opportunities to experience other area for growing people who are able to control the overal companies   

     In conclusion, I cannot agree that to study many academic subjects for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject, considering the above reasons.

208569.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"     Whether to travel by forming a group or individually has been controversial among many people. However, I basically disagree with the position that it is a best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. I have two reasons for my claim. It prevents people to enjoy their personal privacy and enables them to visit only limited places.
     Most of all, people are hardly like to enjoy their privacy once they had a trip by joining a group. As a matter of fact, participating a package travelling needs oeople to organize altogether and always neccessary to have a cooperation with the strangers. Besides, people are even required to eat their meals at same places and a same time. Thus, there is no private time available to enjoying themselves such as walking on the beaches and having some relax when they wish to. As a result, traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite dissappointed. 
     In addition, it is hard to travel around some places where they want to. Generally, the trip's schedule has already planned by a tour guide which makes it difficult for people to visit their own desirable places where they always dreamt about. In contrast, by travelling around some countries alone, will allow people walking around places and take some photographs and enjoy thier holidays. Accordingly, going on a trip individually will be beneficial for people to acess diverse places.    
     To sum up, everyone has different opinions on this issue. However, I strongly oppose the perspective that travelling as a group is better. This is because it provides lack of time to have private time and only few places are able to visit.

I think that successful people are defined by their creating or discovering of something that others have not. It is their ability to forsee things and have the courage and ambition to realize them .
It is not only that they do take risks what leads them to success ,
but it also the commitment and the sacrifices they make along the
way to success. For example this year's Oscar winner for best director Martin SCORSESE ,has comitted his life to a career of directing movies. For many years he made films that others did 
not dare to make . For many years he was nominated for the Oscar  
but remained empty handed. But he did not yield and he continued
to make movies with the same enthusiasm and resolution , always 
trying something different and new , wich finally brought him the award. He is an example of lifelong success .
Some people might be coragous , some very lucky . But i believe 
that what makes a person different and gifted than the other people
is his or her resolution and the undying belief in what one's doing.

Becoming one world

As time goes, the world is being combined together and the definition of borderline itself is also being obsolete. We can easily find those examples in Europe Unions where the physical borderlines have been removed, and NAFTA where, although physical borderlines are still there, economically no borderlines exist. And as the nations are combining each other, people are moving from countries to countries with their own cars and tradings are made between countries by cars because of its conveniences.

Urbanization

As countries being industrialized, the cities will become larger and more people will maintain most of their lives in the city. But the problem is, most people can not manage to live in the city because of high costs living in the city and as an alternative, they will choose nearby city areas as their residential areas to save costs. To live in the nearby city and to commute everyday to their day-life area, the city, they need to commute by their own cars because this is the cheapest and conveniest way.

Economic cars

Today, people classify their cars as one of precious assets they have and this is not a surprise considering the price of the cars. The other problem we are facing is the expense we should sacrify to use the cars including gasoline, maintain expenses and parking expenses. However, as the needs of the cars are shifting to daily essential tools, we can simply imagine that we can buy very economic cars in the nearlest future that consumes less gasoline, less parking places and, of course, cheaper price so that everybody can manage to buy it.

In conclusion, considering the convenience of the cars and the changes which I have explained above, I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today.

354664.txt,P8,HIN,medium,"I completely agree with the statement that 'succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very weel know, it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction then everybody else do. Taking for example the case the 'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called as the successful person even though he is not present, just because  he did different and tried a new thing that is the reson Reliance is so popular today. The new care taker of the Reliance company are the sons of its establisher so we cannot call them as equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his bussiness. What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the bussiness with not much of money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established bussiness. 
                  Taking risk is another part of success as it is a well saying  ' more the risk involved, more the chances of success'. As one can also see that a good thing always involves high amount of risk. To achieve good things one have to go through a series of risk involved as according to another saying ' to get the rose you have to suffer the pain of being hurt', and to get the success the risk has to be taken no matter how painful it can be. 
                  Risks are involved in every new thing or you can say that risk is an internal part of every success one wants to achieve. If nobody would have been ready to take risk there would not have been any new inventions. To be successful in life one have to go thorough one or some other kind of risk. Otherwise success would have been very easy without risk and every person would have been successful or you can say that every person would have been at the same level. 
                   Success involves risks. Suppose during the britishers rule over India if every person espacially our freedom fight leaders would not have came forward considering the risk involved and would have lived the way the rulers wanted them to then would we have ever got independence? Ofcourse not, thats why to became successful and get the independence they had to take the risk of their lives. We can also consider the example of economics in which we say 'higher the risk involved i
","I completely agree with the statement that ' successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very well known , it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction than everybody else does. Take for example the case of  the'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called the successful person even though he is not present, just because he did something different and tried a new thing that is the reason Reliance is so popular today. The new care taker of the Reliance company is the son of its founder, so we cannot call them equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his business. What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the business with not much money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established business. Taking risks is another part of success as it is a well saying ' more the risk involved, more the chances of success'. As one can also see, a good thing always involves a high amount of risk. To achieve good things one has to go through a series of risks involved, according to another saying ' to get the rose you have to suffer the pain of being hurt', and to achieve success the risk has to be taken no matter how painful it can be.

375388.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"The statement at issue is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Young people are considered the seeds of hopes in a country. Helping the communities not only accumulate young people's personal experiences but expand their visions about the various and nourishing lives. I argue that young people ought to pay more attention on the communities and be willing to spend time helping the communities. Therefore, I fully agree that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping their communities. Here are some reasons why.

First of all, due to the flourishing media activities, the grand and big cities are undoubtedly facinated by young people. They are eager to leave their home towns and build up their own dreams and realize those dreams in the prosperous cities. For example, in some developed country such as Taiwan and Japan , young people endusiastically move to those grand cities to pursue their future. Only the elder and the children stay in their communities.

Futhermore, the governoment does not put in practice the education of how and why people should help their comuunities. Helping the communities looked dumb and unattractive for young people. They don't know to help their commuities can benefit the community, whole society and themselvies as well. Thus, the education authority should formulate a policy to demonstrate the young generations the advantages of living in a well developed communities and to educate them that it's not only obligation but also a morale of being a member of a community. 

To summarize, the responsibilities of the fact that young generations do not give enough time to helping their communities should be shared by individual, the mass media and government. My actual observation has me conclude that

Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turnes out to be tho opposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge interpretate the meaning of what they read. Of course- not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might become to our health. And that is one of the points I really think to be unfair from the froducting firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make believe people wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body. They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool. And so do their friends.

1049329.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"I agree with that students should understand ideas more than facts. With the development of technology, more and more people pay their attention on learning knowleged. But which is a correct and effective way to learn knowledge? Some people may think that learn the fact is much better than learn from books, but actually they are totally wrong. Since if you want to understand a thing, the only way is to understand the concepts and ideas.

First of all, learning ideas is a system and logical study. It is going to help people learn a thing very logically and effeciency. For example, when you face a big problem, the first thing you should do is to find out what is wrong with it and then get to know how to solve it. These processes are all based on the understand of ideas. To imagine that you do not even know what is the idea, how can you solve it? Obviously, the ideas are more important than the faces.

Secondly, the ideas and concepts can help students to see deep part of a thing. When you know the fact, you may think it is right or wrong from your point of view, but actually that's may not true. At this time, you need to know the ideas, the idea can help you to analysis the thing, and make you really understand what is that mean or how things work, that's really very important. A really understand is not mean you know the facts, acutally is the concepts. 

Thirdly,  learning of the idea is very essential and useful. Actually the idea is the main part of learning a thing, only if you understand what is the idea of it, then you can study it.  For instance, when I read a book, first of all I need to know the concept of it and then I will read it and know the entire book spontaneously. So it is easy to see that an idea is very important even in our daily life.

To sum of, the most improtant thing for a student to learn is the idea and concept. It will help you to understand a thing very logic and deep, more than just know the fact.

1156629.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"	Some people say that having a variety of knowledge is better,  believe that specializing in one specific subject is more desirable. I think that a lot of inventions which enabled our human lives to be more comfortable didn't emerged without specific knowledge offered by some brightest scholars. Besides, we can get bigger responsiblity and money from specific knowledge. Here is the more detailed illustration belows.

	First, a lot of ingenious scholars which had a great amount of specific knowledge have invented prodigious inventions which makes our lives useful. To put it another way, only such a people who have deep knowledge can contribute new findings which lead human society to advance. For example, I think people who have wide but shallow knowledge are not capable of inventing the airplane or spacecraft that which enabled us to be transported very quickly. This typically shows that specific knowledge or researsh in one subject is so important for human society's advancement.

	My second point is that we would benefit from the specific knowledge more than wide and shallow knowledge. In other words, we can get more responsibility and contribute in our society. In some jobs, there is a role that only such a person who has the specific idea, skill or knowledge can deal with. In those jobs, as only such a person can do, they are to be given bigger responsibility. Moreover, in such a job, we tend to make more money because the number of people who can deal with the task is so few. When people can feel that they have a good responsibility, contribute to the society. and make more money, they are definitely satisfied. This idea clearly teaches me how specific knowledge is important also fo individual person.

	However, some might say that wide knowledge is also important factor to live in the society. Of course, when we travel to another country or watch some arts, we had better have wide ide on it because we would be more impressed. But I think this fact yield nothing to our society, this fact only makes individual person feel content.  Therefore, this position dosen't disprove my point.

	For these reasons, I think having specific and deep knowledge is better than having wide and shallow lnowledge. My idea contributes not only to the individual but also our society.

246942.txt,P6,JPN,medium,"       I do not agree that a group tour with a guide can provide us with the best trip for several reasons.

For example, cars, if the people who are encharge to biuld new models of cars, and  they do not try to do something new, how boring, we do not have a lot of options, but because they take risks we have a numerous options when we are looking for a car, you, me, everybody can buy all kind such as: a BMW, a Jaguard, a Camry, a Jeep, etc. As well people who want to start a new restaurant, the want to oppend something new. If in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some Chiness, Greek, or Text Mexican food, but they do not have a real Mexican Food, I think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area.

1445231.txt,P6,ZHO,medium,"    I don't agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. As for me, traveling is kind of like trausure hunting. Why traveling is always interesting? That's becuase a unknown futrue. Once u are on the way, you'll never know what will happen or who will u meet. Every experience will be like a surprising gift and ever friend will be your valuable fortune in your life. The best thing to explore the world on your own  is to crate memories by yourself. 
    Some people would think it's convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spots right away. That way, you don't have to wasting too much time finding places. And even the tour guide could explain the information or historic stories to let you know without a book. Actually, the tour guide nowadays only shows the travelers to the spots who can make them money. The rush schedule and the arrangement from a tour guide will ruin the true meaning of travel. Most of people usually feel physically tired and empty in their mind. 
    The point I want to make is the real meaning of travel is not only to relax yourself but also to learn the experience from the real world, not from the book anymore. It's not hard to arrange a safe and fun tour by yourself. Before you go to travel,  you can collect much information from the Internet, your friends who have ever been there or even the traveling books. Through the suggestions they give you, and do a well prepartion in advance, there's no doubt you'll have a wonderful tour without a tour guide. You can freely charge your time of staying or decide what kind of places you prefer to visit.  
","I don't agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. As for me, traveling is kind of like treasure hunting. Why is traveling always interesting? That's because of an unknown future. Once you are on the way, you'll never know what will happen or who you will meet. Every experience will be like a surprising gift and every friend will be your valuable fortune in your life. The best thing to explore the world on your own is to create memories by yourself. Some people would think it's convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spots right away. That way, you don't have to waste too much time finding places. And even the tour guide could explain the information or historic stories to let you know without a book. Actually, the tour guide nowadays only shows the travelers to the spots where they can make money. The rush schedule and the arrangement by a tour guide will ruin the true meaning of travel. Most people usually feel physically tired and empty in their mind. The point I want to make is the real meaning of travel is not only to relax but also to learn about the experience from the real world, not from books anymore.

1174342.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I  think that theoretical concepts and ideas are very important to prepare a student and to help him to built his own method of study.For example studying latin, with all those coniugations or maths give you a tool to develop your mind schematically. In my opinion this is a good training, but it doesn't make a professionist.
 I believe that when a student reaches a certain level of theoretical preparation he needs facts : he needs to experience in first person what the issue he has studied is all about.
Learning from practical experiences is much easier and involving than studying a subject on a book.For example; if I had the opportunity to go to United States and study English, I would improve my language skills much better than I could do staying at home and reading an english edition of Oscar Wilde!
Moreover is very important to consider the kind of subject the student is learning:many subjects need more practical training(for example biology) and so other(as philosophy) are better understood with concepts.
Think about those people who didn't have the opportunity to get an education;  all they learnt was basically taken from real facts: I can say that the  skills they have, for example in formulating a conversation, pheraps doesn't follow a logical pattern but if they can apport facts to substain such conversation it is not hard to understand what they are talking about.

One more reason that can make your trip risky is that if you travel to a place that you do not know you are risking your money that you paid for the trip. I beleive that the best way to travell is with atourguide for many reasons.
First of all, a tour guide will be ,for sure, exprienced about the place he is guiding you in ,consiquantely, ther is no risk on you at all to be lost or stolen by the forign people. For instance, one one of my friends decided to go to a town that is known not only its water falls but also for Mafia groups that it hold and when i advised him to be careful and acompany a tour guide, he refused. doyou know what happened?, he came back walking because the Mafia threatend him and forced him to give up all of the money he had. Thus, traveling with atour guide is way safer for you htan travelling alone. 
In addition, when you acompany a tour guide he will show you the most beatiful places in the area (city, town,....etc.) , so that you garantee that you are not risking your mony going to a place where you will waste more mony and time looking for the best place to visit in that area and here is an example about that: one time my mom wanted to travell to another city in a near country of ours, this city (Ollu) was famous for a resturant that offers sea food, after she got there she realized the she was in the wrong city, she traveled to (Ollau) , she was so angry and depressed that she had wasted her time and mony without tasting that food. therefore, a tour guide is a nessecity when it comes to travelling.

My private opinion is that it would be a great issue for the plants and humans healthy when less cars pollute the enviroment with gases and noise. Also it is nessecary to built roads through woods and fields whrere many wild creatures live and so their homeplaces were destroied.
People can also go by train, bus and bycicles or by feet or drive together with other people in one car, instead of driving alone.

I think changes in getting oil will force this behaviour. 
Oil recources are decreasing remarkable in the next twenty years and the price fot oil will increase strictly. So many car owners wont afford the higher money for gas, because their income will stay the same.

For the car industries and the jobs which are connected to it its a dramatic thing, because many  people will loose their working places. 

When I think about all this it would be the best to make now plans what we should do with the problem.
First we could built new possibilities in transporting people 
and find new ways in exploring other recources we have on earth, instead of oil.

924235.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts, but with some limitations.
 I think that for young people is very important to understand concepts in a deep way because after the graduate they should use what they have learned. So is good that university force students to study a lot and do conceptual exams.
But many of the people that attend university are not young, and for them i think that the lesson have to be more interactive and with facts. Infact they need to match what they are studing with what they have learned from their experience. For a young student this is not so important because we do not have work experience.
I attend the second year of undergraduate course in Bocconi, a university of economy in milan. During the course often happend that the lesson is boring.The lessons usually take about 2 hours each and it's difficult to keep the concentration during all the time. It will be better if sometimes the lessons contain facts because that help to hold the concentration and sometimes help to understand concepts.
With this type of lesson students can both learn concepts and facts, start to understand how the things they are studing are related to the work.

Moreover you can chage your idea during the life but before you have to understand that idea. Ideas and concepts are better than facts for students but a preparation only with concepts will not make you able to join the world of work.

         Yes,I agree with the given statement perfectly. Because of several reasons as follows,

* At the young age people are not yet matured as the people of older age,so that they can enjoy the life with out any limits.

* Similarly there is a lot of difference in their daily life span of living such that, the young people does'nt have that much responsibilities  when compared to the older people.

* If we consider an example, the young man that he is not got married. He enjoys his life with his freinds and parents in many ways, such as in parties in functions etc.,because he does not need to go to home earlier that he did not got married.

* But where as the old man who got married have to go home early because he has lot of responsibilities of his family.

* Because the old man lives with his wife and the childrens that there are so much work to do with.

* But where as the young man will enjoy till the midnight of the parties where ever he likes.

* If we note the point that this old man also enjoyed in his young periond so that he now got some responsibilities.

* The young people also has some responsibilities internally, about the future and the studies. But these are not the major problems when we compare to the problems of the olde man has in his life.

* And another thing if we note that some older man also enjoy a lot than the young in some situations, such that these older man are already settled their life and also the life's of their childrens also with  lot of money in their pocket.

*  But these situations are much rare ones because some old people gets settled  and some will not suceeds in thier life. Similarly some old people gets soon settled and some will be late.So by these variations there will get some difference between them.

* Where as this is not the case in Young people, because upto a particular age they will depend upon their parents untill they can get a job. From there onwards also they will enjoy a lot with their own money and exenses.

* Finally the conclusion is that the ""Young people enjoy life more than Older people"".

Moreover if you don't close any doors on your back you can always come back and start with another subject.

1427763.txt,P8,ITA,medium,"As my boss used to say me at the beginning of my career: < Do not be afraid about the sperimentation of new things, do more than others do: no one has never been punished for doing more>.
According to this phrase, I think that people who try to do new thinks normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who silmpy do his/her usual job.
What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to the society. A lot of men could do things well, but only men who do things better than others could reach an higer level in social life.
Taking risk is part of a successful person. Someone who do not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by the society.
For exemple, in cartoons, a superhero is someone who normally takes risk to do something more dangerous than others normal people do. In the same way, this attitude, could be postponed in different realistic situations. In a business environement, for instance, a successful manager is in general someone who is able to ""manage"" riskfull situations (like, for example, take strategic deciosion that could hugely impact company's business).
I think that taking a ""safe"" risk is something that everyone should do in order to make people more confident and more appreciated by society. This will certainly create more successful people.

1054917.txt,P1,DEU,medium,"Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject. Before applying students should take following aspects in consideration.

Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist of a certain area makes it easier once you finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you are received the job you still can and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adopt to tyhe needs of the company you are working for.

Secondely, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extend there is some truth in it, but, undoubtely, experience shows that no metter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same. Nevertheless, doing a generalistical degree is in my point of view better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time. In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only being specified. And the time you have spend remains the same.

To summarize, students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they obtained a degree in a specific subject. Furthermore they should mistrust the rumour that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subjects takes the same time then it would achieving a specific degree.","Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject.

Even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading. They really show up and help when the time comes for doing that.
	 Consider the example of Katrina hurricane. The hurricane left many people homeless and made many children orphans. During that time students and other young people through out the wourld gave the helping hand. Students have eshtablished many camps around the victimized areas to help the poeple. Many people from foreign nations have also helped their best by donating their pocket money. 
	Even though many of the students are busy in their college schedule, they devote some time for social sevice. Many students from club in there collge for helping the under privelaged kids and others. This I am stating from my personal experienced. I am a member of rotract club in college. Me along with some other students have arranged a camp in college to encouraged the under privelaged kids. We went a orphanage and brought few kids to our college and gave them training in sketching, fabric painting, clay modelling etc. We have this program once in a semester and the members of the group work for two to three days on it.
	Even the employs many of companies do have a charity trust to help the community.  These trusts or most commanly called as NGO have a lot of young members. They are more active and enthusiastic when it comes to some adventerous job helping the piligrims who visit temples which are very difficult to reach, setting up the first aid camps in such locations etc.  
	The youth even though is getting busy with their daily routine, they are giving enough importance amd time to helping their communities. Infact it is the youth which thinks less selfishly when it comes to help. They always want to show their enthusiasm in helping others.

Although, advertisements have important effect on the perception of the quality level of a product, I do not agree that advertisements are capable of making products seem much better than they really are.

	First of all, it is illegal in my country to provide misleading information or intentionaly flawed data related with a product or service on its advertisements. Such an administration, makes it legally impossible to try to introduce a product as if it is much better than it actually is.

Especially, nowadays, forums on the web sites and blogs make that period even shorter than ever. For example, if a TV producer, advertises its product as providing the best colours, which is a very subjective claim, and it is not the case, many user of the product may reveal the truth in very short time in various web sites.

	Although advertisements are important in the way that a certain product is percieved, they cannot change the real value that the community attributes to the product for a long period of time.

In case you understand the idea or concept of the building, you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings. In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examble by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind.

In this essay I want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas.

Firstly, you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea. In case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim. Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea.

Secondly, you are able to improve the concept. In case you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable. Just think of the Eiffel Tower which had for the first time an iron scelleton. People transfered this knowledge to other buildings and increased the size step by step!

Lastly, by understanding the concept it is easier to keep in mind the facts. You are then able to understand why diesel engines need less fuel than engines with gas because they use different technics. 

From my point of view it is really important to understand the concept of something. With this understanding you are able to transfer the knowledge to other products or to improve the concept for example by building better products. Also you can easier remind on the facts by understanding the concept.

As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writting and thinking about life in general.
But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case.
Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, trully appreciate the meaning of the life they are living. 
I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main caracter, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with.. therefore, becomes furious of not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide. This if a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when being young.
I think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest, whether young or old, by doing the things he enjoys doing the most. That is when he can reach a mental satisfaction, by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life that is to enjoy life.

The statement  ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn fact"" is also big topic in education. I have studied since I was child, and I have expelienses of  many kinds of teaching methord.  From my experience, I agree this idea I think that teachers can not teach everything, education gives ability to think.
	First, Teachers can not teach everything. In the school, there are time limitations. It impossible for students to learning everything in that school. For example, nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years. Do they know everything about nursing? I do not think so. Knowledge that students receive in the nursing college is just basic knowledge. In addition, knowledge are changed  as research is done. In hospitals, nurses need to study nursing in depth in the critical area; nursing methords are changing everyday. 
Therefore, I think that teachers can not teach every facts in the school; students need to understabd ideas and concepts. 
	 Lately, education gives ability to think: how to deal with a situation, how to solve that problem. If students only understanded facts, they could not solve a different situation. However, If students know the concepts or ideas, they could use those concepts to fit the situations. In nursing, nurse care a lot of kinds of patients: differents age, gender, disease, race and culture. If nurses know concept of nursing care, they would change their nursing care that fit patients' conditions. If nurses did not understand the idea, they could not provide good nursing care, and patients would not have good outcome.
	I think that facts show people one situation. Yet, Ide and concepts give us a lot of possibility. In the education, teachers are not able to teach everything. Students can not deal with different situation if they  only know the facts. Therefore, I agree that statemnt.

436072.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I think that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.
In my opinion, if you understand the concept, you have always time to learn facts or dates.
In children education, for example, it's  important to give them the instruments to understand nature and society. I think it's not so important to fill them with dates and facts. 
Morever, if a child understand a concept, he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life. If he learn a fact without understanding it, he will  forget it in a month.
For example,  i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old,  just because my teacher explained the meaning of them.
I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explenation of them.
If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it for the children has no sense and they don't put attention on it.
The same is in adults education.
In the university of medicine, for example, is much more important to understand how to visit a patient, than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body. You always have time to take a book and learn it.
I have to mention that there are facts or notions that people need to know. For example a doctor, of course has to understand how  the body works and how to visit a patient, but he also has to know the dosis of the medicaments or the name of the most important parts of the body.
An antropologist has to understand the human behavior but he also has to know about history and languages and cultures.
So, even if  ideas and concepts are more important in education , there are some facts and notions than students have to learn.

In Italy he was a well known mozzarella producer, and once he estabilished himself in Canada he began the same activity, with the same method, day after day, and now he is one of the most rich man of the country, exporting his famous mozzarella throughout North America.
Maybe nowadays in a such competitive market this kind of experience has become rare, because of the globalization involving all the 5 continents that causes the rise of new competitors everywhere and because of the growth of the multinational company with uncountible capitals.
What insetad is real, in this statement' is that in our own life, fossilize ourselves is a practise to avoy. A new idea, a different vision of life, market, and so on, can cause a sudden success into our work place, family, group of friend or even into our school, and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position into this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study, to find a job, to be competitive in a single word. 
A clear example of this situation is the advertising world. How can I convince people to buy my product? how can i make them understand that my product is better than others? With ads obviously, but we are surrounded by ads! In the streets, on television, on the radio, on newspapers, on the web, during sport events, everywhere basically, and as a consequence of this, people is no more pay attention to ads.
So an advertiser must find something new, something that attract the attention of the crowd, and so he has to take risks, to innovate his approach. Who stands on his position too long, will fail for sure.
So in conclusion i think that the sentence of the topic fits most of the aspects of our society, but is not to take as a law.

    First of all, nowadays the job market is more and more competitive. As a result, the performance in the school become more and more improtant. However the experience of helping communities will not record in their grade. Meanwhile, Parents expect their children should focus on their study. student are not encourage to help others.

386425.txt,P2,HIN,medium,"Enjoyment in life is very subjective.What one person enjoys doing in life , the other person might think it to be boring and uninteresting.
However, the young people have a larger scope to enjoy their lives than the older ones and hence i agree to the statement that the 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do'

Age is always associated with ailments. During the old age , these health ailments refrain the people from indulging in activities they would have loved to do. For example, outings and adventurous trips are not feasible for them.The younger generation can enjoy the excitement of adventure sports , though not regularly , but surely during the vacations. The activities like driving , gyming are not recommended for the older people even though they might find enjoyment in it. The older generation starts looking at life differently.
They don't enjoy going to movies and plays which is actually fun. They rather find themselves secured within the four walls of the house. 

I have an example of an old man in my neighbourhood.He just watches the young people playing and being energetic about life. He often tells me that he does not enjoy his life, the way he did in this young days. He expresses his desire to get involved in some rigorous physical activity and feel rejunivated.However, his health does not allow him to do so. He just passes his time by listening to old songs and watching the daily soaps on television.

On the other hand, there are a lot of enjoyable activities for the young. If they wish, they can indulge in parties quite often  or  go to the movie halls or watch the plays at an auditorium.They can explore the things which the old cannot. The quality of life is higher when you are young than when old. Hence i believe that the young can enjoy life in a better way than the old people.

1989288.txt,P8,SPA,medium,"I dont agree with this statement that sais that succesful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than those that only do what they already know how to do well.  I think that both things in different ways can bring success to a persons life.
Sometimes a person is good at doing something, and it really enjoy doing it, so she/he really put effort and commit to do  the best they can, and they get success on doing that.
Furthermore, a person that dosen't feel good of doing something or feels that they can be better on doing something else should take a risk of trying new things. For example, my Mom was  good at her job in a bank, but she feel like she need a change and so she took the risk of trying opening  her own bussiness. Her dream was to open a spa, that in my country there are few. So she did it, she took the risk and open her spa. Now is the best spa in my country, even people from other countries comes to mine just to try the spa.
What I want to ilustrate with this example is that sometimes if you take risks or try new things you could be a succesful person, but this is not always the case. Sometimes just doing what you now how to do well, and doing it with effort and willing to do be the best, you can also be a successful person.
Someone once told me  ""Do what you want, but do it right"". So this is what I am trying to explain, taking risks or doing what you know how to do well, but do it the best you can and you will succed.


Successful is around the corner so try your best and you will find it!!!

527417.txt,P2,ARA,medium,"""Young lpeople enjoy life more than older people do."" 
This statement might sound true because it is commomly known that a joyfulsoul and a young heart exist in a young body.

But i have personally an objection about both statements: a young heart can still exist in old bodies if one knows how to enjoy his life and make himself happy.  

An old person should convince herself that she is not a teenager anymore and that she cannot do the thinks she used to do when she was young. This way this old person would adapt to her situation and try to accomodate the things she is able to do to the ongoing life.

Many activities can fullfill the life of an old person and steel away the feeling of gettin board. 

Few exemples may support my disagreement with the stated subject:
By reading , practicing sports if possible, helping people, a person may still find herself useful to the society. This feeling breaks away sadness and unhappy momemts. By working as a volonteer if possible, someone may feel that he is  really helping instead of spending the day wondering what to do.
Grandkids, most of the times love to stay with their grandparents and listen to stories from the past. Dedicating time to grandkids strengthens the relationship between parents and grandchildren which will bring joy to the life of a grandparent.

Many other things also help old people to integrate in the society, like participating into religious and social activities, working in a natural context (agriculture..), travelling....

Still the problem persists with sick old people who are physically unable to reach anywhere or are not enough educated to fullfill their time with intellectual activities... These people still can be happy if they really have a young heart , if they love other people and especially their surrounding relatives. When one knows how to love , he will be loved and will have a joyful life.

Reason being that i find myself on both sides of the statement.  I definitly agree that you have to sell a product for what it is, and don't hide anything, or lie to your customer. But how do you do, when you  are trying to sell the best product on the world, but it just does not look good enough for people to buy.
	I identify myself with both sides of the card, on one side, i am the costumer, and i want to buy a product, that do exactly what they do when they shoe it on the adverstisements, i want to go a 5 stars restaurant and get a  5 stars treatment, and a 5 stars food. 
	On the other side of the card, i understand, that if you need to sell a product, you have to find the way to make your costumers buy your product. 	
	There is nothing wrong to try to to be succesful, as long as your advertisements stay as close as possible to the real thing. And there is nothing wrong either to ask for what you paid for. As long as the costumer understands that sometimes adverstisements are going to picture thing as they are not, people are going to try to push things as they are not.

First, older people have more free time. For example, older people can retire his job when the people got enough money to spent their least life. Many older people can spent both money and time for what they want to do. Some older people can travel all over the world. Some people can gather antique jewelies all over the world. Some  people spend his life treating their gearden. By contrast, young people have to go school. Yong people do not have enough time and money to do all what they want. 

Second, older people have a great deal of knowledge and experience to spent time. For example, older people can enjoy even in five minutes, if they know writting poem. When the older people does not know about writing poem, they would hit on other ideas, ssuch as reading books, talking with others, and thinking about their offsprings' future. They know various choices, because they have experienced various past time in their own past. But, young people doesn't. This is adventage for older people.

So, I strongly disagree that older people enjoy their life less than young people.

In the following  passage I will try to explain my point of view and  give special arguments for this conviction.

If you want to have a discussion on this topic, you must first of all set a definition of what  the  term <helping other people> actually implies.
To me, helping other people is evey form of making an effort to suuport other people in any part of  their lives.
In my social and personal environment I have experienced a lot of situations in which people and especially young people have spent a lot of time on helping other people.

Starting with helping other pupils in class who aren't able to cope with their homework on their own, to helping other fellow students in university with special tasks up to helping old people in situations they can't handle anymore on their own.
In my opinion, another aspect of helping other people can also refer to sport activities. For example in my rowing club is was a common procedure that the older members teach the younger how to row.  By this way of proceeding also the younger members became awre of the fact, that they depend from the help of the older people in the club and  as a consequence of that, there was no question about it, that helping each other was the overall principe of this sports club.
This shows to me that in our society the principe of helping each other is widely spread, and that especiaklly young people are aware of this neciissity.

1087713.txt,P1,ARA,medium,"Some people say that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I think it is good for a person to have a background in many subjects. However, he must concentrate on one subject which will be his major in college and the field of his job. Each person should has one specialized subject. A doctor cannot be a civil engineering at the same time.

There are many reasons why I think specialization in knowledge is better. First, every society must consist of people that have  knowleges about different subjects. As the human body contains different members that work independently and consistently, the society needs individuals with different jobs and ways of thinking. In addition, people are different in what they are interested in and we cannot find a person who interested in all academic subjects. For example, I like computer engineering but hate medicine whereas my brother's interests are just the opposite of mine. Besides, human brain is limited and a person cannot be creative in many fields. This century is not like the past when one scintist, like Newton, was shining in physics and mathematics.

As we have noticed, societies must consists of people of different knowleges and it is impossible to find a person who is creative in many academic fields. Therefore, I disagree with the idea which says that it is better to study many academic courses than to specialize in one specific field.

He tries to include everything that he could do. This is a good thing. But when the time comes for advertising this product. The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he could get profits as fast as he can. Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones.
When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give. Like to give a mobile phone headset, a car charger, a mobile phone carry case, some applications, games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones. When a customer look at this kind of an advertisment he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw it in the advertisment. Then the shop keeper shows him, he does not like the item. Why ? Because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones. But they find them that they are not original. This makes a lot of problem when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else. I would like to share an example that I experienced before a year or two. There is a trademark  who is really popular among the ladies. It sells readymade clothes for women. And his logo is also very popular. A shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost the half price of the material the orignal shop is selling and  he advertised it in variuos magizenes and newspapers. People started  buying from him not also keeping in mind that it's the same kind of material. So this kind of advertisment can loose alot of money on just silly things.

Second, once the student understans the idea and concept behind something the facts will automatically come to him. for instance, once the student understand an idea he understans a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand facts because because all facts have and idea and concept behind them. moreover, it would be hard fo the student jsut to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life has concepts and ideas even facts.

494614.txt,P5,KOR,medium,"I disagreed with the viewpoint in the text. It is controversial whether the number of cars will decreases in future. The two types of viewpoints will be suggested as follows.
 In the one hand, some people believe that cars will be reduced in near future. The cost to maintain a private car is increasing due to the high price of oil and public transportation service is revised in these days. It would be much comfortable to use public transprtation rather than a private car. Furthermore, the new means of transportation is developing now. For example, there is the hobercraft considered to be the means of transportation for next generation. It provides much comfortable environment to ride because it doesn't touch a surface underneath the body. If it become cheaper and smaller as common people can afford it, cars will replaced by hobercrafrs.
On the other hand, other people think that it is impossible that cars are decreased within such a short period. Cars are the most popular machine for transportation in recent days. The world polulation rises in increadible speed and the most polulated country, such as China or India, starts to develop inderstry.

61450.txt,P5,KOR,medium,"	In these days, there are numerous problems which are related with cars, such as air pollution problems, traffic jams, or fuel problems. I strongly believe that these problems will be solved as the numbers of cars decrease in next twenty years, with the changes of the government policy and developments of new technology. 
 	First, government tries to make a policy to decrease numbers of cars, as they face with the problems which are caused by cars. Government encourages people to use public transportations rather than their own cars, and this will decrease the numbers of the cars. For example, Korean government already have a practical policy which makes people prefer public transpotation. The government encourages people who use the public transportation by taking their taxes less. However, people who have their own cars should pay much more taxes, according to the new policy. As the new policy stated, many people try to use the public transportation, and this decreases number of private cars. 
	Second, new technologies develop to substitute cars, such  as monorails, private air crafts, and these equipments will be practical immediately. There have been many researches to create  new transportation which is better than car, and finally these days, these efforts are gaining their results. For example, many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in common places, because the air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars in these days. About two years from now, they succeeded in the development, and according to some newspapers,  it will be practical in ten years from then.

A lot of people love travling but they do not want to spend a lot of money on travling. When people travled to a different place about which they do not have any information, they would get lost while they were looking for the places they wanted to visit. Therefore, having a tour guide with you in your travling can take to beautiful places in short time. There fore I agree on that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because by that, the tour guide entertained you and save your times which are the most important things during your travling. 
	The first benefit of have a tour guide is that he entertains you. the tour guide have a big knowlagde about the place where he tours you. For example, supose you do not know about the good places in Califronia and you went to it. If you did not have a tour guide, you would not good any places except the ones that near by your hotel. In addition, if asked people about the good places, they would not tell you because they might not remeber them. However the tour guide job is to know the good places that will make the tourists entertained. Finally, the tour guide would try his hardest to entertained you, so that you might like him and tell othe pople about him. 
	The second point is theat the tour guide would save a lot of your time. For exmample, one of my friend went to Riyadh, which is the capitel city of Soudi Arabia, with out a tour guide. He thought that since he lives in a country that is near by Saudi Arabia, he should know where to go in Riyadh. On the contrary, hey got lost in it and waste a lot of time looking for the good places and hotels to stay in. His plan eas to spend one week in Riyadh but he spent tow weeks. When I asked him about his trip, he said that he should have rented a tour guide. Eventhough, he went with a group who also have good information about Riyadh, the got lost. 
	Opponents of having a tour guide in a group maintain that it cost money having a tour guide. However, having a tour guide would cost less on what you would spen on transportation by getting lost.

As much as time goes by, older people got more experience from the lives and they already have some fierce. So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But the young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. As my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people.
	As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people should work for living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of thier lives. Young people have more opportunity to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself. Sometimes, he looks like working robot. I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working becomes his routine life. My father has worked hard for the living and he can't stop working even though he is enough rich. I think my father is similar with any older people. Goal of the lives is different between young people and older people. So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. 
	I can't say which generation is happier than other generation because everyone has different conceptions of happiness. It doesn't matter how people live but it is important to enjoy their own lives. People should have their own happiness and do their best to achieve the happiness.

On one side I could specialize in order to become one of the best in what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another suject, while in the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill.

A lot of scientific developpement wouldn't have happened if scientist just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improve the way a viewing physics, he wouldn't have been able to developpe his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics. Usualy greats intellectuals have a broad knowledge that give them a new way of seeing their specific subject. So in many ways both assertion are complementary.

Personaly I am a very curious person. For me all knowledges are good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity. Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I only few can understand. For this reason I believe that it is ""better"" to have broad knowledge. It is more social.

However our social environment and our society enhance expert. If you want to be hire by company, wathever you are doing, you need to be good at it. That the reason why school and university are providing student with a very precise knowledge. You can easily find cours of developpement economy or in  french Middle-Age litterature. 

Our culture is driven by experise. At any cost, you have to master at least one subject. In my view this attitude is dangerous to culture. Culture is diversity, therefore one shoud seek for a broad knowledge, rather than a specific subject.

385578.txt,P3,DEU,medium,"I totally disagree with this statement.
So many young guys today are helping other people to manage their life. I live in a small city called Erding and also in such a small city a club to help students to get better marks established. I joined this club one year ago and first I was surprised how much young people were offering there help there. All of this people are graduate students who use their free time after beeing in their courses and classes to spend it at teaching other students. A major fact is that the other guys and me do not earn a lot of money by this activity. Since my first visit in the club I have been doing private lessons once a week. And I think it is a great honor to see the person teached by you getting better and better grades.
I also have a friend who supports a poor family in Asia with 400 Euros a month. Without that help they could not even buy clothes for all of them. 400 Euros is quite a lot of money also for the european way of life. But the girl works hard for beeing able to afford this project. 
Another example for proving my statement given above are many other students and friends of mine. I have already asked many people for their opinion about the fact that many older poeple that the younger ones do not care about the environment surrounding them. Most of them refused to join the military after finishing school. Instead they did a social work. This would be for example helping older poeple to get to the supermarket or to the church. And surprisingly every one of the enjoyed his job. Everyone agreed that they gained a lot of social experience whithin this time. 
To sum up I would say that young people often are misunderstood. They are neither laisy nor not willing to offer their help. You can find young poeple all over the social environment working for free and helping the people who need this help.

Twenty years ago there were less cars: this is a sign of our economical and technological improvement but this improvement take us a lot of problems that  were unthought years ago. The biggest problem is the pollution of air that we breath because of the cars's gases. This problem brought to the water pollution too and provoked the birth of a lot of new illnesses that didn't exist years ago. So I hope that in future the number of cars should decrease to have less pollution and to have a good environment. Another solution could be found in some improvement of science to eliminate the pollution provoked by cars.
Another negative aspect of the high number of cars is that, expecially in the cities, every day, there are a lot of cars that crowd it and give problem to traffic. So a decrease in number of cars should give more quiteness to cities and should be easier for people going from a part to another of a city. A solution in this case must be found by gouvernaments that should decrease the cars into cities improving the public transports. If the net of public transport is well organised, I think that people would be stimolated to use it and to leave cars at home and so wouldn't be so important having two or three cars per family.
So, in conclusion I think that with a small improvement of science and of gouvernament's control will be fewer cars in use than there are now, and I hope that this will happen so we can live in healthness and in quietness as the life was twenty years ago.

It could be a stupid examples, but it is fondamental.
At the restaurant people is divided in two categories:
the gamblers and the ""abituee' "".
The Gamblers always try new plates, new food and that excite them. The feeling for a new flavor, new taste makes the choice both unaspected and exciting. Of course there is the problem :""What if the taste is not so good?"".But once you have choiced a new plate, you have to own the risk.
The ""abituee"" are the opposite of the Gamblers: when they go to restaurant, they already know what they are going to take. They do not experience new thing and so they will not improve themself: they are too closed-minded to understand the thrilling of a possibility.
The gamblers have much more possibilities to find the perfect plate for the perfect dinner. Only with the experiments on new food, people could understand what they like and what they don't like.
I think this example, because it is strictly connected  with life. Successful people are successful, because they have risked and maybe they tried so new many things that, now, they know what is the best for them.

On the one side, petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable, for instance because they are under big cities. 
Moreover, governments are developping tube, train or bus to encourage people not using their own car and to pollute less. For example, lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown in the tube in Paris.

On the other side, the population of Third-World countries is growing, and at the same time, lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering bying a car.
Futhermore, lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent. For this reason, it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them just every hour.
Besides, scientists are considering developping cars with hybrid motors, which rely both on electricity and oil. It could be a very good solution to the cost of the oil. For the moment, those cars are puchased above all in Japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the countries of the world.

To put it in a nutshell, the issue of the cars is rather an issue of oil supply. Till hybrid cars are not very fame, the number of cars could hence decrease. However, it would rather be the case in big cities where people have other ways to go to work. To my mind, twenty years is a very short time to introduce hybrid cars but it is also a vey short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their can as often as today.

To my mind, twenty years is a very short time to introduce hybrid cars but it is also a very short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their car as often as today. "

Because of the great improve of technology we have a convient live. But it doesn't mean other subjects worth nothing. Good society needs good policy and it relates to many many different subjects like economy, history and so on.

There are some persons that study for a lot of years to learn the rules of marketing and to learn the right ways to achieve their costumers.
Today, on television, we can see a lot of beautiful advertisements. We are often intersted and enjoied from they, but when we buy this products in a supermarket often we are not so happy for our purchase.
I think that often the advertisements that I see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention. For example next week I saw the advertisement of Barilla, a famous firm that products some types of pasta, and I thought that this is made as a little film. It`s beautiful because it talks about the life, the ways that childrens have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her baby, through all of this the advertisement speak also of a new type of pasta called ""piccolini"".
I think that this is a beautiful advertisement and each time that I watch it on tv I really want to buy the product.
Few days after to have sought this advertisement I have eat this type of pasta and I understood that it is not so good as I believed, infact I prefer so much the normal type of Barilla`s pasta.

520764.txt,P6,ZHO,medium,"Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people. Some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide, they think that it is more quiet and peaceful. As for me, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. But I disagree with considering it as a best way to travel.

First, most of people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel. In some scenarios, it may very dangerous to traveler. For example, if you travel alone in a forest where the modern technology can not be used to communicate with outside world. Imagine if you miss your way in the forest, meet some dangerous animals or get injured by accident, how would you continue you travel. In this situation, it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide. Your friends can help you if there is really some bad things happened. And since there is a tour guide, the opportunity of occuring some bad things may decreases. So you can totally enjoy your travel without always worring about all kinds of situations. 

second, common sense tells us that human beings are social animals. So for most of people, they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone. Imagine, you and your friends in a travel, you can talk some funny things, you can share some feelings, or play card with your friends. People in group will make you travel more interesting, you have more things to do. However, if you travel alone without a tour guide, you are been deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends.
 
However, I disagree with the claims that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Because the modern society provides us many opportunities to choose. Some people can choose to travel by other way by their own option. But I recommend them to prepare enough and gather materials about their travel route carefully to resist potentially dangerous events that may happen to them.

So, generally, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide as a very good way. Since, you may get more pleasures. And the travel are safer to you. But I think that travel in other way is still a good way to some people by preparing well.

1229440.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"I disagree the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in Japan, there are following reasons.

First, the way of thinking is verifing now, so car makers should produce many kinds of cars to match the pople's needs. Some pople use theircars only when go shopping, others use their cars as a kind of hobby. they like suport cars, racing cars or off road cars, etc. Today, a tipical family living in Japan has one car. But it is said that a tipical family living in Jpan will have two cars in a few years.  one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother. The price of cars has bacome very cheap because of technology development, a tipical family will be able to buy two cars in a few years.

In addion, in Japan, we cannot have second car now because we don't have enough parking space in our home or we cannot pay the expensive parking fee. But there days, the Japanese real estates have become cheaper than before. if this situcation continues, we will be able to have enough parking space in our home or pay enough parking fee in a few years.

At last, in Japan, the goverment improves the railroads and highways by investing a lot of money these days. Because the public transportation system in Japan has been imploved these thirty years, and then the govermaent now thinks to improve the railroads and highways mainly. As a resault, the terrible trafic jams in Japan will be resolved in a few years, So the number of Japanese who want to buy and use their car will increase.

I do agree that young people do help, but the point is they did not give enough time on helping. Maybe they just spent a few minutes for donating some moneys or giving their seats to the elders in the train or bus. That is totally not sufficient. 
	Regarding to that issues, there are a few reasons that cuase this issue. First of all, young people are too busy. They need to face more challenges and difficulties in thier life compare to last time as the world are improving and developimg so fast. If they are students, they need to concentrate on their studies and get a very good results to get a place in a university or a position in the company.

Nowadays, people may need to know much more infomation compare to last time to sucess in the society. This includes computer skills, speaking skills, writting skills, and experts in more than one language.

The communities may be some of sport, music or religious. And what is helping? Helping may mean helping in the familiy (which is part of the community) or by helping direct the community. 

There are several methods of helping in communities. These methods changed along the years:

In former days people were perhaps more friedly and more helpful to each other. They were another generation and had other living conditions. I also think that the people have had another familiar surrounding in which they lived and worked. As young people they had to help the family e.g by going in the fields and doing farming. They also used to help other families, because they benefits from each other. The families had not so much money and so much things like we have today. So helping was very important. This were a community in these days.

Nowadays the familiar surrounding is not so close as it was a hundret years ago. There are more singles or more families with divorced parents. So the surrounding in which the young people live nowadays is completely different to thos who lived a hundret years ago. But this fact I think is the critical point: The young people nowadays want to have a bigger or a more family like family. Because of this fact I think, nowadays young people are also engaged in their communities by searching a more completely familiy.

So I disagree with the statement. My own experience confirms this. A lot of my friends are in several sport or music communities. And they help there for non profit. I am in our religous community in my town and I am helping the pastor for non profit.

A lot of my friends are in several sports or music communities. And they help there for non profit. I am in our religious community in my town and I help the pastor for a non-profit. "
358795.txt,P7,HIN,medium," I agree  on the statment that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.I support this statment by giving reasons and examples in the following paragraphs.


firstly,students should understand ideas and concepts because it makes them to understand clearly and accurately.Understanding ideas and concepts of a particular topic makes their work fast and perfectly. For example  suppose a student wants give a seminar on the topic spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and throughly.So that he or she can generate more ways of elaborating the topic  which can be helpfull during  the seminar.


Secondly,learning the concepts makes  a person more perfect in the topic which he is about to work .so that he can generate new ways and methods .for example during the preparation of an experiment the scientist should know the concept of the experiment  so the he can work well and aviod risks and harmfull effects.
Buy understanding the concepts and ideas clearly and correctly one devolop more knoweldge and data regarding the topic rather than learning facts.

Thirdly,facts are the material which have been devoloped already which can not be developed further.but understanding an idea and concepts we can futher discover and invent new ideas from the idea we have.for example using the water and its properties scientist have developed the steamengine .

Famous scientists  who had devoloped  the concept of numbersystem was clearly understood by aryabatta has discovered the algebra using the numbersystem.students should understand main idea of the english reading passage  so that they can answer the questions in the questionpaper.facts may not develop and increase the student knowledge.so one should understand concepts and ideas of the material and topics what they learn in the class.quiz questions can be answered correctly by the students if they understand the given topic for the quiz to be conducted.


Lastly ,i conclude that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

	First, young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young. For example, when young people want to eat some great dishes, they can eat all of them. They can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot. However, usually, older people cannot eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot. 
	Not only can young people enjoy eating, but also they can enjoy travering. If the person who is young wanted to go to somewhere, the person could go there soon. The person does not need a lot of preparation for the trip. However, if the person who is old wanted to go to trip, the person would need a lot of time to prepare the trip. So, young people are very flexible and agressive. 
	These aspects are very important with young people, however, healty is the most important part of young people. Older people are suffered from a lot of illnesses.

for example i thaink that the concept of peace can be better undersand if you know history, in fact with that matter you understand that war gives people only poverty, difficulties and not good things. i think that it is easy to understand concepts if you have a real invironment in some facts.
the ideas and concepts, with the study and learning of facts  give us a strong base of our education and it is important for a good future improuvment .

     Nowaday, seniors are older and more lonely than before. However , they are our history and we have a lot to learn from them. 
Children should take care of them to learn their own family history and to have enough culture in order to do not the same mistakes done in the past.
For example, in my family without the help of my grand father I never should have known how and why the World War 2 was. Memory is a way to never do that again. 

     Underpriviledge people should be helped too.  Anyone could be in the same case during his life so a children must learn : Do what you would like that people should do for you.

Somebody creating new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks. And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member, and then becoming famous and successful. Finally without any of those vertues, somebody can heird everything from another and get indirectly successful.

First of all there will be governmental laws which will limit the number of cars allowed in the city. Because awereness of environmental hazards that is caused by cars are increasing. Altough there are products like bio-oil and exhaust filters, which decreases the demage, increasing number of car usage outlaws this decrease. Actually there is already an application for this. For instance my father, having a car with stronger engine pays much more money tha I do. Because a stronger engine will cause more demage to environment.

Secondly, petrolium prices will go up to a point where only upper class people can effort it. The reaon is simple: petrolium reserves will be diminished. There are reports indicating that todays reserves will last only about fifteen to twenty years. Also, last years price increase clearly illusturate this phenomenon. Now I have to pay twice as much many as I did in the begining of the year to fill the car. There are atempts to make cars work on different sources of energy such as Hydrogen, electricity, sun light, etc but they are unlikely to enter the market any time soon.

308280.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"   The question asked is if students should focus on learning facts, or rather on understanding ideas and concepts. This issue has a big importance because it is linked to the teaching style addopted by schools and universities, as well as, to the learning approach that students should choose. In my opinion learning concepts and ideas is better than studying facts.
   I belive it is not effective to learn facts because facts are generally linked to one particular situation or experience. Many times this facts are from the past. On the other hand, concepts and ideas can be applied to a bigger number of cases and during a longer time. For exemple , what happened during the Second World War is already in the past, but the concept of war is common to many situations of this type. Based on this idea, i am convinced that it is more effective to understand concepts and ideas.
     Furthermore, it is reccommanded to study concepts because the prcess of understanding a concept stimulates and develops thinking skills. For instance, when a student concentrates on the concept of accounting rather than on memorising the balance shit, he or she will be able to understand much more, like the idea of imput and output, in general. Due to this fact , i think that studyig concepts is superior to learning facts by heart.
     Finally, i believe that concepts are easier to memorize than particular facts. Because concepts can be associated to so many situations and to so many mental images, they remain in our mind a very long time. Moreover, concepts tend to become part of our mind, of our permanet way of thinking, but facts don't. For exemple, if we understand the concept of trade, there are so many situations we can link this to, like ancient silk trade, slave trade, modern trade , so on. Because of this, I prefer studying concepts and ideas more thad learnig facts.
  In conclusion,  the facts that concepts can be applied and linked to more exemples, that they stimulate thinking and are easier to remember, demonstrates that studying concepts is a better option. I believe that while studying a concept, a student reaches higher levels of intelligence and of efficiency.

I know some people who works for the ambulance: they are volountaries who stay, some times also all night, at the ambulance to give his help in case of need, and the day later they are in office to work. There are also some girls I know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they`re seek or need help. Theese girls have a big sense of responsability in helping others, I think.

She say me she feel much better when she helps the neighbours. 
I talked about some people I know, but I didn`t say nothing about myself.  That`s why I have never done something for my community.

I could give some time to my community for example cleaning natural parks when the community of my town organizes the event of cleaning the city.... but I am sure I will forget it or I will decide do do something else that day...that`s why really I don`t feel to give my time to the community...I`m not a good person like my friends. 
So it`s true, there are many people like me who don`t spend enough time for the community. It would be a better world if anyone would spend more of his time for that.

1646354.txt,P2,DEU,medium,"In my opinion this statement is true. I think this is since young people are at the beginning of there lives and not in the middle or at the end of it. You can reccognise it if you start a new work. Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or month you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting.

Here are some examples why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more to live than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You have not to be concerned about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not. It does not care you. 
On the other hand it really depents on how people have planed there lives. The most grown up people I know, have a house or an appartement somewhere, children and a job. Those people have really not a lot of changes in there lives. The time schedule is nearly every week the same. 
However I know some other peoples who have a completly different way of live. For example one guy I know, he is 50 years old now, stopped to work with fourty. He has had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on with for the rest of his live. So he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world. He works from time to time if he can at a bare in Jamaica, but only one ore two months in a year.

115526.txt,P2,JPN,medium," As people grow older their interests may change. Whether young or old, each generation has each ammusement. However I  think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons.
 First of all, generally speaking, young people have less careful to their health than old people do. As people grow older the possibility that they become sick would become increase. In hospital there are too many older people who consult in doctor for many reasons. As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the most dearest thing of all.
 Second of all, young people has not their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan of the future easily. Old people cannnot never change their job or their partner of marriage. It makes the life of old people boring and less exciting. In addition to that old people have heavy responsibility for their job and their family. In contrast, young people have much time in the future; they can  draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream.
 Finally young people, perticularly young women can enjoy fasion and cosmetics. In the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women. This means that young people tend to enjoy  fahionable life and fashion brands target not old woman but young woman. Young woman can spend more many fashion that old woman do because young woman can use their many freely. And as people get older they get their weight more easily that they were young and they cannnot wear the closethes that were fit to them when they were young.
 Young people enjoy their life tma
","As people grow older their interests may change. Whether young or old, each generation has their own amusement. However I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons. First of all, generally speaking, young people are less careful of their health than old people are. As people grow older the possibility that they will become sick willincrease. In hospital there are too many older people who consult a doctor for many reasons. As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the dearest thing of all. Secondly, young people do not have their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan for the future easily. Old people can not ever change their job or their partner in marriage. It makes the life of old people boring and less exciting. In addition to that old people have a heavy responsibility for their job and their family. In contrast, young people have a lot of time in the future; they can draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream. Finally young people, particularly young women can enjoy fashion and cosmetics. In the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women. This means that young people tend to enjoy a fashionable life and fashion brands target not old women but young women. Young women can spend more money than old women do because young women can use their money freely. And as people get older they get their weight more easily than they were young and they can not wear clothes that fit them when they were young. Young people enjoy their life too."

969165.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"The issue at hand is whether or not young people  give enough time to helping their communities. This is an important topic because  it relates to the community development. In my opinion young people help their  communities in many ways  which certainly consumes their time.

 A main reason for view is that young people often come out  to help their communities in the time of disaster. For example if an earthquake hits a particular area then youn ones come out in that area to collect the money from all over the world. They advertise it in the paper, on internet, in TV and  everywhere other possible places. Not only that the earning young  people give their  salary to help their community. To organise and collect  money for such noble cause, it certainly demands time. Thus the young people are giving their valuable time to help their community.

Another reason for my point of view is that  young people devote lot of time in reasearches and for  carrying out innovations. For example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young ones right from the day of their cihildhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly. Many of them carry out such inventions also. It's also a sort of devoting time towards the community helping.  In this way also, they devote time towards helping their community.

Lastly, young people manytimes carry out demonstrations in case some epedemics  spread in an area. They, in the evening or some other suitable time, go and tell their people of the community  what precautions should be taken to avoid the spread of such epedimics. Many young people just volunteer to the government aided services in such cases on their own. Such kind of act from the young ones shows that they care their community and they devote their precious time for helping their community.

In sum young people care their community a lot. They help their community in one way or other. All such activity certainly demands time. On the whole young people apart form carrying out their duty devote their precious time towards helping their community.

441517.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"I disagree with the statement. It seems to me that those who hold this kind of opinion limit the meaning of ""helping their communities"" to activities that a traditional local community used to require of their members, helping neighbors, clearing away the roads with them, participating in the local festival, for example. However, since changes in society and life style made traditional comunities almost disappear, it is now difficult for almost all people, not only for younger generation, to be helpful to others in the traditional ways. This might seem a lack of interest in people other than one's own family and friends, but this is in fact not the case. People still feel the need to help others, and have begun to do so in a way different from that which was common in the traditional community. For example, instead of talking with their neighbors or relatives to solve the problem they have, they use internet to communicate with others who live in a distant area but share the same problem. This helps the vexed people more effectively than the traditional neiborhood community did. Another example is the growth of communities of those who share the same hobby, cooking, photographs, travelling and so on. They also work as the substitution for the traditional local communities and provide people with the oppotunity of making friends of different status and different age. Perhaps the most important instance of people helping others is the existence of many volunteers in the time of earthquake, flood and other disasters. There is, I think, no need to mention that many young people participate in these new kinds of activity of helping others.

In my country ( CAMEROON ), usually in our culture, people do not like to travel in a group and they do not want to be helped by a guide. For example, last year, my parents decided for their vacation to travel to CAP VERDE in south Africa. There were group trips but they did not want to travel with them because they think it's better to find a place by yourself. Thus, in my opinion, I deem that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. Because in that way you get a free guide and a chance to visit many places easily"

it is true in a way that we don't do our best. we can spend a lot more time to make our city a better place. we can take part actively in regualtions. also we can spend more time with the elderly. we can do this by carefully planiong our spare times. but usually we choose to relax and be with our friends whan we have time. one of the reasons for tghis is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before. almost everything in out lives can be done with professionals. because of this people less intefere to eachpothers lifes.

on the other hand its true that we are doing what ever we can. even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the communuty. I do not have time but when I see my neighbours I ask them If they need something. I am living in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters. I ask to them if they need anything when I am going to the market or example. If something is going on in front of my eyes  i do not close my eyes, i interfere and help. If I am not aware what can i do about it?

One reason is, that students who just learn the facts of course have a great data bank but it's just learned by heart, they don't see any connections.
To see those connections the students have to take a look at the ideas and concepts of what they learn.
Another reason is that students, which just learn by heart everything, are not as able to make a decision as students who see more than just the facts.
For example, a history class talks about an important happening in their country's history.
On the one hand they have to know the dates and why something has happened, without this it is impossible to talk about the reason and the consequences, but on the other hand it is needed that the students understand the idea which leaded to this happening.
Only with this both kinds of study combined it is possible to have a productive discussion and a succesful education.
Finally I disagree with the statement, because I think that it's not possible to choose between one of the kinds of studying.
The students need both to get the best out of their education and so it's important to use both types for studying.

173637.txt,P8,DEU,medium,"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only do what they already know.

I have specific reasons for my opinion. Which mainly support the idea of success and development. 
The first an most important reason is, that I strongly connect success with challange. In order to have a success I need to have a challange. You can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate. He is doing this every day, without any change. Therefor he has no challange, because he has done this several times and knows what to to. Without the challange he can not show a success and won't be recognized by anyone.

The second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful. Everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular, new or difficult.
In order to do new and difficult things, I need to know my capabilities. These capabilities will need training. Hence if I do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities, I have less possibilities to choose of. Therefore I am limited in the things I can solve. 
In contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which leads to be more successful.

The third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful. For example your boss will test you before he promotes you. He will give you things to do that are new for you. For that you will have to take risks to solve this problems. Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful. I had this often in my personal career. My boss tested me and gave me difficult tasks. He was not mainly intrested in the result of the task, but how I did it.

In conclusion, success needs people to take risks, move to unknown territories and try new things. Without this there would be a stillstand not for yourself but also in the recognition of others. I do encourage everyone to take risks and try new things whenever you can.

This isolation causes to associalism and ends by becoming self- centered. When they need help for their own problems, they just have to browse on some online forums and get the answer they need. 

However, this generalization would not be all accurate. There also exist some situations when young people help their communities such as teaching English language and computer utilization to homeless children, organizing visits to old people, cleaning the streets of the hood they live in, preparing theatral sketches and concerts with the goal of a more compaq gathering. 

All in all, I do completely agree with the statement because young people nowadays are totally busy because of the obligation of self-improvement. This selfish point of view is the weakness of their relationships with the communities and I think that the cause of their organization problems is that they become more individualists. Creation of some `e`-campaigns in the name of cultivism, is a must that has to be done for the future of the communities.

997307.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"   When I was a litle boy, I always thought about "" Why does Uncle Can look sad?"". It was the times that I tried to create new thoughts in my mind and tried to find why we happened to be alive. Uncle Can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind. I tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic -like I said, I was a little boy then- , which i solved lots of times. However it did not matter how many times that I have solved his problems. It just made him to create more. Then I understood that it is not just the ""things in his mind"", but there is something more which is socially structed by human beings and our culture. As time goes by, we grew up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society, which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people.

  When we are talking about society, we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structed situtations. In this example that I will give, one may see things more clearly. When I was at elemantary school, I just had to pass my courses, then I attended to the highschool , now I had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university. Now I am studying at Bogazici University which is really famous in Turkey. However my missions continues to increase and advance while I am succeding and going on. This may seem a story of one. However that is not the truth. The truth is as a human being grew up, he/she will have more responsibilities which makes us more stressed than yesterday. Why do you think old people loves to look at old pictures? It is obvious that he/she wants to be like in the old days, the olds days that he/she had not any responsibilities. It may be seemed like only constructed society is to be blamed. However that constructor is us. Human beings create society  and society creates human beings. We cannot really seperate them. Human beings are well known as progresive and ambitious and that is why we are always trying to better and more powerful, that makes us stressed and unable to enjoy life day and day.

   To sum up, as time passes we will become sad and old. Because that is what we created by wanting more and more. In this post-modern world, we are stucked in our created destiny, which is as we get older we will enjoy life less than younger people.

It means also the possibility to practice new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air. For example 
But it is also necessary to live with dignity.
	Secondly, young people do not generally have great and impellent responsabilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends, go dancing , practice known sports , stay up late without any problem.
	Moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems in concentrating and remembering the things they learn. This problem can seriously affect their chance to learn new things reading books, which I believe it is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy. Another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which often lacks in older people.

In several important and crowded cities in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolated apartments or even wostly in retirement houses.  The frenetic rythm of our society seem to emarginate the people regarded as unuseful so it is impossible for them to live in a life in wich every day is seen as a possible to enjoy life.

1530737.txt,P6,KOR,medium,"  First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow.
  One, by my personal experience, traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by on own. Because the travel company which the guide is associated in always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights. In that case we might not able to chance to stay in nice hotel with cheap price and have no season discount on flight either. For example, one of my friend went Germany from Korea with a flight costed more than $1000 through the travel company, but I went same country following week, less than $850 with getting season descount on my own.
  One more thing is that guide always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itiniery. In that case you won't get chance to visit some nice place that only few people know. I once had a chance to stay on a nice old castle in  France. Most of friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after saw the picture I took.
  Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes. According to the 8 years of personal traveling experience, most travel accidents occur in a group traveler. Because when we travel in a group by a tour guide, people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide. And that causes accidents such as robbery. One of my roommate once traveled Spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated. And he had paid attention. But while he were doing so a stranger cutted out his camera.
 Three, if we travel alone we get a chance to make international friends. I still keep in contact with them and when they visit my country I guide them.

For example in Austria this problem existed already many years and the 68-generation which has been blamed for putting too much attention on the fun parts of life already started to state their opinions about how bad the current generation is. I don't think it is because the focus shifted to have fun. The reason for the missunderstanding has something to do with development. Because of economic development in many Western countries every generation started at a much better position than the last one. Many improvements establishments during the industrial revolution created free time that needed to be filled by something we like to do. When most people were farmers they had not enough time for fun activities like going running or playing soccer because they were too tired after working on the field the whole day.
	Many developed countries have low weekly working hours and therefore provide space for people to enjoy their time. But of course also the free time culture didn't stop but continued to improve. The new hobbys greated during the time seem like more fun for the older generation who is not able to do this kind of activities anymore. They are jealous about this new sports (like skateboarding or snow boarding) but forget that their generation also developed new things that seemed strange for their parents.
	I don't think that modern generations have more fun than older ones but instead suggest to look at the cultural, economical and political context in order to judge this question. Only because our grandparents enjoyed different things than we do it doesn't mean that we enjoy life more than them. Now I am young but when I become old I might change my opinion, like they did.

 If you have that spirit of investigating, like in trying new ways of finding certain knowledge, you could consider yourself as a succesful people. Other important thing, is that if you are scare of trying new experiments or new methods, that at first could seem rare or odd, you coud never have the believe that you are going to succes in the life.

	To begin, the growing number of cars is becoming a problem nowadays. In some cities, like London, they tried to find a solution to reduce the number of users by asking a fee to drive into the city. Having so much cars in a confined area brings a lot of problems like pollution, parking problems, accidents without even thinking about the fact that so many cars consume a lot of fluel. 			Speaking of, it's abundance is dropping dangerously, and of course the price is equally expanding. It's becoming a luxury to drive now.
Maybe there will be a restriction at some point, that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week. This could encourage people to drive with friends or colleagues to a work place for example. Thanks to this, fewer cars will be in use every day! 
I'm actually wondering if certain firms could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work. This could even bring people closer together.

	If you watch sciencefiction movies, you quickly realise that in most of them, there are not even cars! The cars have been replaced by some kind of machines flying around. Perhaps some scientists are currently trying to come up with new ideas to replace cars in a environmental friendly way. 
	A easier way to reduce the number of cars would also be to expand hugely the different forms of transport like train, bus and subways in a way that cars will become unnecessary. If people realise that it's easier, cheaper and faster to go anywhere by train, bus or subway, cars will become useless. Sadly, this is still not the case nowadays. Certains areas are to remote to acces them by any other way than by car. It is still easier and safer as well to ride home with the car in the middle of the night.
Anyway, I'm curious how the means of transport will evolve during the next years.

There are several reasons for young people not to take actively part in their community. The main point is the missing education of children and young people. Today many of them aren't well educated in behaviour. Families don't spend enought time to affect the children's behaviour, because they think it is the teacher in school who has to do that, but he isn't. A familie has to provide  social rules to it's young members to make them known in the importance of relationships and communitive life. To me, religion also plays  a role in this education. Many young people aren't religious for several reasons, but religion can have an important effect on the peoples communitive thinking. It teaches equality and understanding and it tells that every single person is important and a good relation between each other is one of the most important thing in life. Most of my friends who are members of the christian church are highly interested in our community and participate actively. Another reason for the missing helping is the influence of mass media on the teenagers. Advertising implies that everyone is only next to hisself, no one else matters and it finally suggests that one is the middle of the universe. Young people who haven't a working familiar background, are left alone with that suggestions. It is no surprise that they can't cope with the influences and that results in missing interests of the community they life in. So as I mentioned in the beginning the main thing is education in the familiar background to increase the number of actively working young people within communities.

                                              With increase in travelling time,people also tend to stay in houses closer to work place, so that they can walk over the distance rather than  to fight the traffic with the cars.
              With increasing awareness regarding the hazards of air pollution & the effect it has on health of humans , the people twenty years from now i think will be much more sensible and use less number of cars to keep the earth's environment  cleaner & safer for future generations to come.

So when the roads are blocked due to the innumerable number of vehicles , it is obvious that it takes a long time to reach your destination & if this becomes the daily routine it vexes the people, so they ultimately look for alternate modes of transport , like trains or other means of public transport. The trains & the other transport systems definitely reach earlier & also spare the driver from the stress he encounters while driving on his own on the busy streets. These factors definitely encourage him to use trains more often & use his car less. With the increase in travelling time,people also tend to stay in houses closer to the workplace, so that they can walk over the distance rather than fight the traffic with the cars. With increasing awareness regarding the hazards of air pollution & the effect it has on the health of humans , the people twenty years from now i think will be much more sensitive & use a smaller number of cars to keep the earth's environment cleaner & safer for future generations to come.

784935.txt,P5,ITA,medium,"I disagree with thoose who think that in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, because it is a cheap way to travel, car is very comfortable and with the car you can reach  almost of all places in the world.
First of all i think that travlel with car is cheaper than other way of travel like planes, trains or boats. The reason is that if you want to travel with your car you have to spend money only for the oil and for the highway. Consequently the money that you will spend is lesser than the money that you will spend for a ticket for a boat or a plane or a train in this way for example you can save some money for the journey or for other things.
Second, in my opinion, travel with your car is more comfortable that travel with other travels way, because modern cars have all optionals like satellite navigator, that is a modern device that allow you to not lost yourself in cities or country that you don't know, comfortable seat, computer on board and many others. Furthermore car is comfortable because you can leave home and arrive to the place decided whenever you want. Consequently you don't have to wait in a station because of train or plane delays, for which you will arrive late for example to a date.
Third, i think, that with the car you can reach all locations around the world and you will have the liberty to choose to way that you prefer to reach it without any limitation.
In conclusion i think that for the reasons that car is a cheap transport way that is comfortable and useful to reach almost of all places in world, the car will not be fewer in twenty years than today.

The essectial reason can by seen by everyone is that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the requirement of our morden scoial and the work you have. When I entered into the social and starting my first task, I know that knowledge of one specific subject is not enough. For example, when you examining project finance in bank, you should know many things relating to accounting, project analyzing, risk management. During the process of examing those projects, it will be difficult for persons majoring in financing to analyzing the prospect of project such as steal, mobile and telecommunication. So, broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help you solve those problems.
Another reason of my view is that the trendency of the development of science. For example, accounting belongs to the economic science and information theory belongs to the communication science. However, the blend of the theory of accounting and informaiton in the last centry produced a new catelog named the theory of accounting information. So, broad knowledge of many academic subjects may spur the development of science.

All experiences bring to a conclusion which is the theory. But before arriving to the theory, scientists have to define the problem, make hypothesis, practice, find a solution and draw an hypothesis.
Nowadays, in science class such as chemistry, physic, or biology, students have to follow the same pattern: problem, hypothesis, practice and solution which lead to the theory.

Thus the theory is the result of the practice. For education and everyday life, it is very important. It represents a base, a fundemental part to understand a topic.

To receive the best instruction, it is necessary to understand ideas and learn facts as well, if not the education will not be complete. "

	Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who likes sports. Even thouth one do not likes sport, he still can talk about sports topics to other people. Because he knows the knowledge of sports, he can creat good friendship by communiting easily.
	Moreover, learning every knowledge might help people to discover their other skill. For example, a doctor always works everyday. One day, she studies dancing, and she feels the dance is her insterest. therefore, she has another skill and interest which has a big difference between being a doctor and a dancer.
	Finally, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that it is easy to chang a better job. Because people have a lot of skills and knowledge required by some companies, they probably can be hired by any companies. For example, there are two people interviewing a job. One have wide knowledge, but one has specific knowledge. There are much more changes that the boss will hire the first person.

It is a fact that oil prices are higher than ever before. Also the polution shows a lot of economical and enviromental problems and it is enough a reason to stop using the cars because of their leck of usefulness in the cities.
Oil prices is a principal problem for western countries which haven't their own oil supplies. For example in europe, it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes, insurances  and enormous fuel costs. Also the leck of space in major cities make the price rise up. One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe, e.g. the goverment in Vienna is making biking routs in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its habitants. Holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car. A city designer in London said that cars shouldn't design the city.

Cars are expensive:since the car has began a status symbol its price has risen enormously.
And the more people continue  buying the cars at any price the more the price will rise

Air pollution is caused by car: have you ever asked yourself  _""how does it cost all the publics works to clean  the building of the cityes from the thick dark layer of smog that cover them?"", or ""how dose it cost to restore the streets every two years ?""

The public transport can be more efficiet and less stressing:
I think that public transport are the ony solution to the problem of the cars. We offcourse cannot avoid  to travel, we need to, we only have to consider more efficient way to move.
The most importan features of public tranport is that the allow many people to travel at the same time with a grate maximization of the result at the same price.Furthermore there are new technology that use not energy that involve pollution such as solar energy, wind energy and so on. I think that future must go in this direction to have  a safe life for us and for future generations.

not only what you know to do would help you acomplish things, but to try new risk would help as well.
it's true that a risk could lead you to lose everything, but it's also true that you may gain more as well. 
For example, a successful leader must have risked something very precious to him/her in order to get to where he is now.
I like to point out leaders, because I personally admire one who left everything behind, family, homecountry, friends, mony-savings, etc. for his dream of success, and took a nation up to its highest point; in every matter, such as, economically and more.
I believe it is always good to take a risk, even if you fall while trying, there has to be something good learned out of it.
It is when we risk that we understand that a fall is juts a steping-stone in our way of success. And you learn to stand up againg and never give up, and keep on your way.
If you just stick to what you know, no matter how good you are at it, you are going to get stock in a simply way of life and never progres up rather than to risk a bit and get more instead.
A good risker always make sure to get the most out of a fall.
Feeling confident of yourself at all time is also helpful when taking a risk, keeping in mind ""I can do it"" would help you get what you want easily. 
You also know what are you best at, so just take a little risk and improve your knowledge way farther.

91268.txt,P4,FRA,medium,"Advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life, in several supports and in severals ways.
To wonder if advertisements make products seem better than they really are could be seen as a non-sense question, because precisely the aim of an ad is to make a product unreplacable.
That is why I agree with this statement.
Advertisements are made to give people the will to buy the product. It's also the only way to get people aware of a new product, and obviously the better is this product, the more people will buy, even if it's just to try. So my first point is that advertisements should and must make product better than they really are, because they're made for that.
My second point is that advertisements can do more than just showing a product at it's best. I mean that advertising is also a way to build an image, a spirit for a product and for the people who buy this product. For example, in advertisements for cars, advertisers manage to show only what they want to insist on, in order to attract a specific range of customers. They can insist on security, fun, sportivity, but it's always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving. So advertisements are a way for producers to sell their products by giving more to the consumers than only the product.

Obviously all people are not sensitive to the same purposals of advertising, and that's a way to highlights the weakness of advertising. An ad can't be liked by everybody, and sometimes can't be understood by anybody. So ads can also be unproductive and unefficient. The point is that I believe that advertisement can be both very profitable and dangerous for a producer.

That's why I finally confirm that I really think that advertising is very powerful, and very important for the life of a product, but it has to be well prepared, well broadcast to be very effective.

Our school has to do more than 20 hours of voluntiering work for 3 years of junior-high school. This may feel that we are foreced to do it, but even though we are forced to do voluntiering, I say we eventually help out community.

The only resource that can help Korea to keep on going to the top would be students or  young people intelligence. A few days ago I found out that not even Japanese students study as hard as we do. What I also knew was that Korea's students had high grades in  math and science than other country students. Many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now.  The result to this, many parents of Korea's young people are making their children to work harder than any bodyelse. for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on.

1014998.txt,P7,ZHO,medium,"Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors.  But to be frank,  I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence on them, and I would explore a few primary ones here.
To begin with, we can lean the ideas and concept during studying factors. Teachers will be able to teach the student the ideas and concept by teaching a specific fact. Let's take look at a physic class. At the very beginning , the teacher give the class a specific problem, and ask them to solve it. The student might not be able to solve it, so the teacher could tell the some conceptional suggestion that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think it again. And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept.
Further more, why do we learn the ideas and concept? For practical work, of course. So, why don't we learn something that is more practical? Learning facts will lead us to work directly, and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theories or concepts, and this would save much more time. 
Last but not least, studying facts will sometimes be more useful than studying concepts. For example, imagine we are learning how to repair the bike. From the books, we may just know how to solve the general problems. But when we face a special problem, an intergrating problem that noises from all over the bikes, for example, what could we do? We might feel complicated to solve this kind of problem.
To sum up, learning facts can help us save a lot of time and because of the purpose of learning is for work, studyng fats might sometimes be more useful when we work than studying ideas and concepts.Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that it is advisable to learn facts rather than to understand the ideas and concepts.","Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors.

    Everytime when I meet young people, I feel an air of freedom. They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers. They may have little knowledge or even non-educated, but they have desires to explor the new world. Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there. All these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads the youth to be higher, stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people.

    Another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth. Because of the limitation by age, the old lose lots of enjoyable things.  They may be rich and healthy, but they do not have interests to nice food; they can buy a great varity of clothes, but they do not have good look. Apart from their elders, the young take advantage of a nice age. No matter what clothes they put on, they seem to be active and handsome.  They do not need to worry about the blood prssure while taking delicious pizzar or other fast food. Life begins with good food.
 

   In conclusion, I admit that there are negative ponits to young people. The fear of unemployment,  hard work, scarce resource,consist it.But they are lucky for the youth.

  Yes I do agree with the following statement that the best way to trravel is in a group led by a tour guide. First a fall, the tour guide would probably know about the place where the group is traveling. He would have taken the essential measures which are required to be taken for that particular place. Such as a group is traveling to a hostile area where the roads not properly construced, the climate is too cold and there are possible chances to be injured. Hence the tour guide would have taken the medical aid equipmet, he would taken care of where to sleep, and he would have made a list of place which are worth visting.  
      People who travel in a group which is led by a tour guide are relaxed as the guide would have given the list of the equipment which is required, the places to see would already be known and the number of days they are going to vist would be known. Where as if an individual travel would take precaution there is to be taken he would carry extra thing which he would not require. He would have no idea what are the place to be seen also what time they are open. He  would be worried about various things unlike the people who travel in a group. Also people who trave in a group are not tensed about the initial problem which an traveler faces such as food, where to stay, and who much would the trip cost him in the end as all the group member would have to pay a fixed price. These are  the reason to travel in a group","Traveling is when a person or group of people move from one place to another either to visit a place or for a particular reason. As traveling has proved to be fundamental for many countries' economies. Many countries in the world benefit from the tourists who come to visit their country as it leads to an increase in the entertainment sector, the hotel sector, the employment sector, the foreign currency which they receive and the infrastructure of that country gradually improves. Yes I do agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First a fall, the tour guide would probably know about the place where the group is traveling. He would have taken the essential measures which are required to be taken for that particular place. Such as a group is travelling to a hostile area where the roads are not properly constructed, the climate is too cold and there are possible chances of being injured. Hence the tour guide would have taken the medical aid equipment, he would have taken care of where to sleep, and he would have made a list of places which are worth visiting. People who travel in a group which is led by a tour guide are relaxed as the guide would have given the list of the equipment which is required, the places to see would already be known and the number of days they are going to visit would be known. Where as if an individual travelled there would be taken precautions there is to be taken he would carry extra things which he would not require. He would have no idea what place to be seen and also what time they are open. He would be worried about various things unlike the people who travel in a group. Also people who travel in a group are not tense about the initial problem which a traveler faces such as food, where to stay, and who much the trip will cost him in the end as all the group members would have to pay a fixed price.

Young people nowdays are getting more and more selfish. We can hardly see a young person helping a old granny to cross the road nowdays, because we prefer chating with friends beside the roads. 
      I do not really know South African young people's behaviour, but i know young people in China very well. Of cousre, not all of us are selfish and unconsidering, but the majority of the youth are selfish. They are everywhere, in the school, on the street and even just in our families. Unfortunately, i think that i am one of them too. i remember when i was in the schools of China. We need to do the daily cleaning everyday by ourselves, because that was and still is the part of our school duties. Class teacher divided us into several groups, and told us the date that we would be on duty. We want a nice and clear environment to study, although we do not want to do the cleaning by ourselves. Therefore we expected the other people could work harder to get the classroom clean. BUT, other people also thought that way. So, as you can imagine, we all worked not hard eough. Therefore, the next day we had a untidy, dirty classroom. People who had duty on that day might think that: They did not do the cleaning well, so why should I? Therefore, the next day we had a untidy, dirty classroom again. Then it just carried on like this, so we never had a clear classroom! 
      That looks ridiculous, but that was exactly what happen. That is all about selfishness. Young people are just like that, pushing the duties to the others. Then the others will push them to someone else. We just cannot understand that if we help the others, they will help us oneday, when we are expriencing difficulties. Young people nowdays DO have enough time to helping their communities, but they just do not want to give it.

For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literture and found out themselves that certain techniques add to the porfessioness of writing.

    Getting the concepts and ideas also provides students a chance to be creative, especially when dealing with are. What kind of art class whould it be without studio work? Students should be offered to get creative with colours, textures, moods and all sorts of thing. Who cares if they fail once in a while? New creations found in the process of real understanding.

1598284.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts?

By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information. Huge topics and their contents can be passed in a minimum of time. But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned them.

If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they do realy know it and will not forget it as quickly as they do if they would just learn it without understanding. 

So both sides has their positive and negative arguments.
The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand.
 
Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not realy understand or would you be better of with some information you can handle and understand? 
Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. 
Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. 
If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just to huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it.
So one should not concentrating on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) neither one should just learn facts. You would not know what to do with them. It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs what you have not learned, you are helpless. 

Referring for the question of the essay, there is no ""more important"". It is as important to learn facts as to understand ideas and concepts. If students go to an extrem they will find out that this does not work.

Today society is complex, the human nature and a lot of processes are complex too. If you study you try get in to a certain topic, a topic which is also complex. Just if learning and understanding are combined in balance a student can be long time successfull.

When I was younger, I have been fooled by advertisements several times. One of the better example is when I decided to lose weigth, I saw at the telivision, peels that seemed like magic because without any effort, users could lose a lot of weight and very quickly. Of course, these pills did not work as well as the advertise said, however it helps me to understand that the purpose of advertisements is to sell a product and to tell to the clients what tey want to hear.
On one hand, I think it is quite normal for an advertise to only talks about the advantages of a product, even if it is a kind of lie not to tell to the clients everything that they have to know about the product. On the other hand, it can be really annoying for an user to see that it is harder than in the advertisement to make the product works. For instance, it is always making me laugth when I watch my mother trying to use a very complex oven that she bougth because the old one did not have all the functions of the new one. She never achieves to correctly put the alarm, thus the food is nowadays too much cooked.
However, now before I buy something quite expensive, I always go on the Internet to watch the points of view of users. This is very helpful, for example, when I decided to buy a new laptop I spent over a month to compare the producer's advertisements and comments from users. Furthermore, I think that when the promises of a product's advertise and reality are close that shows the seriousness of the producer.

She never achieves to correctly put the alarm, thus the food is nowadays too much cooked. However, now before I buy something quite expensive, I always go on the Internet to watch the points of view of users. This is very helpful, for example, when I decided to buy a new laptop I spent over a month comparing the producer's advertisements and comments from users. Furthermore, I think that when the promises of a product's advertise and reality are close that shows the seriousness of the producer. "

    Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just to follow his/her guide. In addition, the member in the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and funny. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with the your groupmember. 
    However, in other circumstance, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strick schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interupted by others, travelling alone may be better choice. In addition, if you tend to go a place, where is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone.

Secondly, if a person understand about an idea, it is possible to get interested in. Because it is the only a hard time before he/she understands. After they know what it is, then it becomes a very interesting idea which can get the person very interested in.

Lastly, self confidence is really important to students. By understanding ideas and concepts about some subjects, they enjoy the time to study which make them to know more and more.

When I was in a conversation with an American visitor in Genova, standing in front of the Columbus museum, I could not remember, when America was discovered. A such an important date is known by any second grade child, however I could not remember the year. He reminded me, that America was discovered in 1492. I felt very bad at that time that I never forget this important fact in my life. 
However, I am convinced, that ideas and concepts are much more imporant than learn facts. Concepts are more likely to be necessary in the daily life, than are facts. What I mean is, if there were two or more contries combating each other, it would be war. From school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times, that in all wars many people were killed, and in most of those land and people changed nationality once the war was over. During the war many people were killed and tortured. From the concept of war we know, that it is a very bad situation for all involved and that there are many loosers and few winners. This concept is known by everybody.

In an nutshell it is important to know impotant facts, such as the discovery of the American continent, but it is far more important to understand ideas and concepts, in order to draw conclusions of a possible outcome.

473771.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I think that both of these options are very important for a student. Of course, it depends on what is your field of study. For this reson I would say that I desagree with this statement.
For example if you are studing history, is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of shure this is also a very important knowledge that is required you, as historical, to have.

Is really very important, infact a student is studing for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what are you studing but I can't say that this is more important than learn facts, because without the knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something.
I'm thinking about when I was studing mathematik: for me and also for the teacher was very important that we, as student, had understud the ideas and concepts behind an algebric formulation, but of shure you need to know very well also the formulation itself.

An other reson why I disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text books, you can't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you don't remeber the facts: I'm thinking at some friends of me that they study something and after a few hours you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink, exept the main ideas.

To the other side I think that is important in the future, I mean after 10 or more yars after your studies, to remeber the main ideas and concepts; and is quite impossible to remember all the learned facts.

1349535.txt,P8,DEU,medium,"It is common opinion, that successful people have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
When I think of a successful discovery, the first thing that comes to my  mind is the discovery of America.
Christopher Columbus tried to find a new sea way to India. But instead of finding a cheaper and better connection to India, he discovered America by accident.
He took the risk of failure, because many people believed, that there can just exist one possible seaway.
The thesis, that the earth is a plate and not a globe, supported their idea.
Instead of taking the usual, common way, Christoph Columbus tried to risk something new and succeeded in the end.
But at the same time, new experiements and ideas ma also turn into a catastrophy.
One example can be the invention of nuclear weapons.
Einstein did not intend to destroy the world with his discovery.
But if a new invention or knowledge gets into the wrong hands, it can also be used an evil way.
Atomic bombs are now used to destroy life instead of secure it.
Another reason, why past traditions, ideas and ways are as equal important as new discoveries and inventions is the learning aspect.
People have to learn from their failures and mistakes, in order to succeed further.
However, some things can only develope when they had been already experienced before.
 In this way, people could discover their positive and negative aspects.

1314208.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"	Some people think students should learn the result of facts. Even though that is importnat for stdents, I myself believe comprehension of ideas and concepts are more neccessary for mordern life. 

	People enable to manage their skills to their life easily. For example, when a person knows how to figure math concepts, the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programing field. If the person wants to be computer creater, the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business.

	Learning facts is risky to interfer students' motivation. It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover theirselves to solve the problmes. For example, in math class students always spend much time to consider to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process help sutdents to make motivation of studies.

	
	Finally, learning only result is not always true. Again, math class could be good example. Many people notice text books often have some mistakes. When a student only learns the fact, a studnet might misunderstand everything.

	Therefore, there are three reasons that I do not agree to learn only facts. Understanding ideas and concepts help people to use their paticular subject to their life easily. Also, this has posibily to improve students' motivation fo studies. Finally, the facts sometimes mistake from the text.

It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover themselves to solve the problems. For example, in math class students always spend a lot of time considering to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process helps students to make motivation for studying. Finally, learning only results is not always true. Again, math class could be a good example. Many people notice that text books often have some mistakes. When a student only learns the facts, a student might misunderstand everything. Therefore, there are three reasons that I do not agree to learn only facts. Understanding ideas and concepts helps people to use their particular subject in their life easily. Also, this has probably to improve students' motivation for studying. Finally, the facts sometimes get mixed up from the text. "

However, before accepting this point, we need to consider some of the further issues. 

First of all, to build new transportation systems friendly with the ozone and capable of transporting large masses in a cost-effective way necessitates more money than it is ever estimated. There will ne a whole new system of highways or railways for the new kinds of transporters. 

Besides, in order to convince people use these tranporters rather than their own cars, the new brand transporters have to be much more comfortable than the cars used by people. If such a great invention cannot be made to either the transportation system or to the marketing of this system to become widespread, the project seems to fail down and people prefer to use their own cars rather than the new system. 

In order to make this system preferable over the use of car transportation, the benefits of the system such as its being cost-effective and less harmful to the oaone layer than the car usage should be explained publicly.

     Advertisment means  announcing about some thing wheather it is good or bad. but comercially ;you do not have to show the bad qualities of your product other wise peapole will not buy it 
    for example if you advertised that your product is not suitable for olders also the youth will not buy it so you have to lie and say it is suitable for all people to give it the chance to compete 
        you have to say that your product is tcken rapidly to incourage people to try it while in fact it is stored in all shopps

Once I bought ashirt and it was advertised that absorbs sweat without harming the skin but after only one day i suffered from allergy up to two monthes after that irealized that it was not made from cotton but from pollyester 
Once again I bought a pincil and it was advertised that it will last with you for at least one year but unfortunately it was brocken at the same day

214190.txt,P4,DEU,medium,"When we reading the newspaper in the morning, watching TV or walking along a mall we indirect recognize that the numbers of advertisments increasing.

The question is, if the promises will get real ?

Short time ago I read an article of an bulb supplier. This brand supplier promised that the bulb which this company produces are have a better quality, a higher lifecycle and the efficency is any percent higher than all competitive products. In order to save energy I trust this ad and bought a lot of these bulbs and I payed more than for a competitor product. I was happy to get a high quality product. A few days later the first bulb was defect. I brougth it not back to the store beacuse it is more expensive to drive to the store.
A few day later I met a friend. He told me that he visited the factory which produces these bulbs. He explained that millions of bulbs where produced and the last process of the production is the brand stamp on the glass and the packaging.

He explained that the same produced bulb will get different brand or noname stame and will get different packaging boxes. This means that the same produced product, with the same quality and the same effectivity will be sold with a higher brand price and a lower noname price. I checked the different brands and noname products he told me and found out that only the price has a difference.

As conclusion of this I will no more trust any advertisments. Advertisements are designed to sell products. They promising a lot but not the truth.

In order to explain this topic, we can show that this is a controversary point, depend on which condition you look at this situtation.

First of all, it's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing up very quickly, and there is more and more car on the road. This certainly du to the increasing of the price of the train and plan ticket this last ten years.  But, you can tell, that ingenior in the industry try to change this problem, not by trying to reduce the car industry, but by trying to find a new way not to polute the planet, like by biocarburant. Furtheremore, It's nearly impossible to avoid people to use their car, like for working people, or people living far away. And in addition, today, having a car, is also to be part of the social world, to be autonom. 


However, You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear. When you see the fast evolution of all the other way to be drived. Furthermore, lots of people prefere public transport as a cheaper way to go to work, and gouvernments understood this and is developping this, like in hong kong, where you can do everything without anycar, or in London, where the city doesn't allowed any car. Or even in strasbourg were the french gouvernement make cheaper ticket in order to encourage people to let their car at home.
In addition, we can not planned clearly in which way the world will evolute. If you take as an example developped country, because it's the one who will be more affected by this matter, you can already tell how they already try to developpe other way to move in and outside of their country. Take as an example, the train developement and the decrease of the price in some compagny helped by gouvernment.



In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of car in use in the road in tweenty years, in my opinion, I can say  I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road, this due to the evolution of the population. But with the news technologies, the bad effect of this in the environment and as a bigger scale in the planet, can be reduce, which is a good point, and as a matter of fact that the petrol ressources in the world became really rare, which can be a real turn in the car industry, I hope in the good way.

	Firstly, adults enjoy their lives more  because they are more experienced and know what the true enjoyment is. Youngsters call playing computer games, going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life. However it is too small to be an enjoyment of one's life. Older people enjoys their lives in a greater range. For example, a head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit, directing people and going to dinner with his family, which are far more enjoyable that playing computer games. 
	Secondly, Adults have a freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy. For youngsters to enjoy their lives, there are numerous thing that are not permitted to do, such as drinking, traveling without parents. However, there is no such barrier for adults. For example, my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business. Then he told me that he would go to these beutiful places and would come back with better future. I, after listening to him, immediately thought of all the stress that I am getting from school and planned a travel alone. However, I could not make the trip because of my parent's disagreement. From that moment I deeply realized that I can enjoy my life when I grow up.

All what young people has to do is going to the universtity, which is considered a source of pleasure, and all what he has to do is passing it. Here, he can do alot of things to make him happy. He can meet different people every single day, he can have his own group to spend nice times with, he can go to different places while being with that group, and he can enjoy being in an intimate relation by having a girlfriend with whome he can spend great times with less commitment.
   While, on the other hand, if we think about the older man who is supporrting that young man, we'll find alot of things to consider. He has to save money for his son's university, he has to manage the situation of the whole home inwhich there will be other brothers and sisters, and he has to keep managing for the wholy marriage life he is having.

            Everyone have a community to live in ,but do not give it enough time to helping. What is your community?Your community is representing you. If you do not give you community a time to help you are even do not help yourself. You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community, you community will develope so you will develope and you will think better to have a very good and connected community.
            Why young people do not give their community enought time to helping.I think that they do not think of this or this thing even do not  come to their mind.For example my cousion he work very hand to get a very high salary and to have a very comfortable life and to get his family happy of what he done but he did not think  that he can get his community time to help. maybe if he think they will help and this is why do not young people give their communities time they want someone to tell them because they only think of what they have and what they will have and ignore their communities.
            Communities is the more important thing or the first thing in young people life than other thing because you are growing and stating your life with  helping from you community and you must try to give a time to helping your communities.
             In my conclusion, i thing that we must remind a young people and try to help them and give them solutions that will help them inorder to help them to help their community.

Communities are the more important thing or the first thing in young people's lives than other things because you are growing and starting your life with helping from your community and you must try to give time to helping your communities. In my conclusion, i think that we must remind young people and try to help them and give them solutions that will help them inorder to help them to help their community. "
1423696.txt,P3,TEL,medium,"	I disgree with the given statement because i think it depends on individual and not on the time available.  A person who really wants to help his community   can surely take out time for the same whereas a person who is not that interested will use his time for other purpose rather than serving his community.
       
	No doubt that in the present generation the competition has increased and inorder to lead a resonablly good life people we really need to work hard. So in running after making penny people are overlooking the need for sparing time for working for the community. But still its not true that people dont give enough timefor community. For example, recently mumbai encountered a bomblast where thousands of people were injured.Then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospitals and geting their treatment done. A group of students took shifts for whole night and served the injured with bread and tea.I think this showsw the concern left in people.

   Donating money for development of poor people is also one way of serving the comunity. Because of the vast destruction of psunami many people were left with starving stomachs.In many colleges people collected money food, clothes and gave it to the government for sending them to the required places. Serving community not only means that you have to take fixed amount of time separately for it. I think helping the people where ever you find them is also serving. For exapmle, when we are on the way to office and come across a blind person struggling to cross the road  helping him will also serve the purpose. 

   	In short for serving community we need not be the active participants. Seeing the people reaction in such cases like psunami and the bomb blasts i think young spirits are still burning.

876354.txt,P6,KOR,medium," I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with tour guide. When I was a kid, I went to sighting with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling led by guide is so bad.

 In begin with, traveling with guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you a free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes which have a tour is relax without busy life. If you go with guide, you will not get any fresh air.

 Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested, others  have a desire to move another places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do. But any group in this situation would be disappointed.

 Finally, there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone, you are not alone. It means that going trip alone allows you make frineds. For instance, I went to Japan when I was a freshman in the university. I had a traveling for a month. I cannot speak Japanese fluently In that tour, I can make friends - Nakasaki, Murama, and Yorisimo. It was an unfogettable experience. When you are with your fellows, you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends.

 As I mentioned above, I don't like traveling in a group led by guide. Fixed tour planning makes me exhausetd. Group tour makes persons dissatisfied. And if you can go somewhere alone, you can get friends. On the contrary, if you are very old, you can like a group tour with a guide. It makes sense that if you are satisfied with that, you are too old to feel free.

It is because that the companies want to make their products more popular in the society. For instance, BurgerKing will make advertisements to show how healthy their burgers or frech fry are; however, the fact is that any junk food is no good for health.
        The advertisements about toys are the most popular one on the TV, since kids can not read yet and the careness parents always make their kids' requirements come ture; the companies of toys are make millions of cartoon characters or games which based on the cartoons every year. But sometimes the real produsts are not as valuable as the commercial shows on the TV. It means that the companies do not respect the consumers' rights to purchase right and great products.

First, The people who are successfull are well experienced and have diiferent  ways to approach things to solve their problems since they already know what is good and what is bad from their experience and knowledge they lgained.  for example scientists who come up with new innovations in this present world are very imaginative in inventing new things rather than working on the same thing again  and again for example Thomas edison has undergone great strugglle in inventing the bulb if other scientists worked on the same research then we wouldn't be enjoying other pleasurable things that made our life easier and quicker in this world lke invention of aeroplanes,cars,computers etc.,.

Some people think that they indeed have the positive influence to make them much better; others have diverse opinions. To me, I agree that most advertisements make products better than they really are. There are three points presented as follows:

	The major function of advertisements is to  attract consumers' attention. For example, some shampoo companies mention that their product is the best among others by showing the positive results from their cosumers' surveys. By doing so, the cosumers might purchace this product by this persuasive evidence. 

	In addition, some advertisements create certain interesting slogans which diffuse to peoples' daily life. The public might be influence by the slogans and start to mention it on a daily basis. By diong so, the reputation of the product will be increased, and people might not be awared of it. Although people get to know this product and maybe to purchase it to see if it really works, this trend seems to make the product better than they really are.
	
	The last but not the least, most of advertisements are made to intrigue cosumers to buy the products. How to make people notice this product is the main intention of the advertisements. In order to let the public gets to know the product, some companies even invite a celebrity to show off in their advertisement. Some fans of that celebrity might be interested in buying the product due to this factor.

1300821.txt,P1,JPN,medium,"   I agree with this statement. I think that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important for several experience. Also, it is useful on the several situation.
   First of all, I think that people who have the knowledge about anything are respected by other people. If the teacher know about not only English but also scientics,  when he or she is asked by his or her students, he or she can answer smoothly. And, they can solve their question. In my case, my English teacher has knowledge anout anything. For example, he knows about the art, the history of the livings, and the lifes of the other countries' tribes. When I talked with him about these subjects, I was surprised and thought that I could learn various things from him as my teacher. I can ask the question what I can't solve, and everytime, he responds my question. Therefore, I respect of him because he is intelligent.
   In addition, if people know that, they can use their knowledge anytime. For example, when they are forced to write the essay about the subjects that I mentioned before, they can write them without researching. They don't have to waste of time to investigate or ask to the others. Moreover, even if they research about them, they know the basic things, so they can improve their knpwledge from other information. In my experience, when I had to research to write the essay about the problem about Yasukuni Shrine because I had no idea about that. At that time, I regretted that I didn't have the knowledge. If I knew about the problem, I could write the essay more deeply or effectively. 
   In summary, I think that it is good thing for them to have the knowledge about various subjects. One reason is they can be praised their intelligence when theycan answer the question from other people. The other thing is that it is useful on their lives.

1470658.txt,P5,FRA,medium,"For several years the price of the gas has been increasing. It had made people change their habits. And because there is no evidence that it will decrease soon, people have started to change their habits. First they are more likely to use common transports than they were in the past. Also they use less their cars for small ride. I think this trend will keep going and that year after year, people will use their cars fewer and fewer, only because gas is becoming to expensive.
Some cities try to encourage their citizens to drop the car. For example in Paris, the mayor's policy is to develop the use of public transports and to reduce the use of cars. So for several years, buses have their own lines in the streets to be quicker and not stopped by the traffic,  the days of big pollution there are restriction of the vehicules admitted in the streets, and parking' price is cheaper for the resident so their cars don't move. This policy makes it so difficult to drive in the streets of Paris that I assume  many people will drop the car either for a bike or a scooter than for public transports. Of course people living in the countryside are not concerned by this policy. But other projects, on the national level, try to incite them to buy clean cars, or having a more responsable use.

Secondly, People use public transport rather than their own cars. every year, people who are using public transport such as buses, trains and subway is increasing.

1578728.txt,P2,FRA,medium," Do you have more pleasure when you were kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious. We will see that being young provides less responsability, more time and places to socialize and a better health to enjoy the life.

The biggest difference between older and younger persons is that the young ones has less sorrows. Children and teenagers don't have to care about money, their parents do. They also don't need to worry about cleaning the house, buying food, it is also their parents jobs. The lack of responsability enables to focus on other things in life: having fun.

","Do you have more pleasure when you were a kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious. We will see that being young provides less responsibility, more time and places to socialize and better health to enjoy life. The biggest difference between older and younger people is that the young ones have fewer sorrows. Children and teenagers don't have to worry about money, their parents do. They also don't need to worry about cleaning the house, buying food, it is also their parents' job. The lack of responsibility enables us to focus on other things in life: having fun.

780493.txt,P2,JPN,medium,"     Without questions,I agree witn this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do. I have two reasons for this opinion: energy and freedom.
     First of all, I think that  young people are able to exercise more harder then older people because  they are young, so they have a lot of energy in general. In my grandfather's case, he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even the huge things when he was 21 years old. Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured when he was junior high-school.I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster end play some sports when you are 70 years old.
     Secondly, I asserts that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on  easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, the older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think. It is because that older people have their husbands or wives in many cases. Of course, if you are young and not married, you can make boyfriend or girlfriend freely. While it may be true that not every young people can fall in love with someone, and older people tend to have much money than young people. However, young people are given the freedom. That's why they may be find their love affairs and are given money by thier parents. To be young means that to be free, I think.
     In conclusion, I support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do. His/her energy and freedom enables him/her to enjoy life, I think.

1568886.txt,P5,JPN,medium,"     I agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are three reasons to support my opinion.

     First of all, especially where I live in Japan the population is getting smaller every year. Some people estimate that the population would be half in the future. Of course, when the population gets smaller, people who use cars will be decreased.

     Second of all, the focus on the environment is getting bigger every year. Without doubt, the fossil fuels that cars give to the air are very bad to the environment. So I think that the use of cars would be restricted internationally in twenty years.

     Lastly, it is more dangerous to use cars than to use trains. The number of the traffic accident increases, so people might get to think that they should use trains to move because it is much less dangerous than to use cars. 

     For those reasons,  I definitely agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

I have three major reasons to say that .One of them is newer types of car are being produced and the second is the transportation with car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that to be done for people to transport    
      The first reason for not agreeing the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of cars are being produced. These types include cars which works with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things.There are also plans to create cars which is flying near to surface and this will provide place for some more cars.
    The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars are very huge.There are other ways of transportation for example planes.They can`t belong to anyone in the world but car can be used by most of the people.Nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country. Cars are effective for transportation for many people 
     The third reason for not agreeing this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes.They should be very expensive changes, that is needed to compansate for the need of transportation of the increasing population of the world. Installing a new system is required and for this system many new researches  should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again.

In my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk. Becauso there must by any reasons because this person is unsuccessful. So perhaps an unsuccessful person already took some risks which were not successful. So they are in a kind afraid of taking new risks. If the new idea is wrong they will lost again. 
And this is different at successful people. They have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risks. They are not afraid. If the risk was wrong there is a base under them and nearly nothing could happen to them. But one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risks.  
For this I will give an example. You have to imagine you are the CEO at a big company and at the moment the number one with your products in the world. But there are several smaller companies which are coming closer and closer. One day a customer want you to create a new product, but with your machines this is not possible to take the order.

It is different for a CEO who's company does not work right. On the one hand the company needs the order but on the other hand it is the end of the company if the order will not be successful. 

Another reason is that successful people always want more. So they do not think about as much as unsuccessful people.

I told her the it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she can't even figure out.

But she said no to that and said she is the smartest in the class and all the people are not very intelegent as she so she can not take a risk. That response was beyond my expectance of what she would say.

	To this question, asking me if I disagree with the successful people try to take a risk, I totally disagree because successful people have a pride more than average people so I assume they take the way they think are right.

But, I disagree with this kind of opinion. 
From long time ago, people have complaint about younger than them.
However, nowadays youger people volunteer in many fields for their community and they study very hard.

 First of all, we can find many young students to volunteer in many place.
Of couse, some school need some volunteer job for their credit.
Even though,  there are many students to do it just for helping their community.
For example, we can see many young poeple to voluteer in the orphanage or hospital or school.
They can be very helpful in this kind of place.
Because,in the hospital or orphanage house , there many peoples to desire the help.
But the supply is very lack compare to  the demand.
The young people compensate the gap.
How appreciatable thing it is.

 Futhermore, many young people study hard and work for thier future and their community 
Actually healthy minded young people can be very important resorces for their community.
They take responsible the future of their society and the results, it can the most helpful thing for society.
For example, if young people reglect their duty in the society, it can be very miserable thing for the community.
Because they are our future by themselves.

    It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students., what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students to image. It is the easiler way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variaty of the facts which can attract the students attention. If a teacher do not use the facts in class, the students maight feel tedious and boring to listen. At that time, they will move their attetion to another things. Thay will cause bad effects to undetstand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize.

The teacher can show the wave by press the water and the student can see what is the water wave like. That is why the facts have the better way to make the students understand.

When it comes to a question like who enjoys the life most, then the answer seems to be obvious.Of course; the young  people enjoy the life more than older people in terms of several reasons.
First; I can say that young people have more free time than old people.Therefore ; this means that they have more time to spent on their hobbies and favorite sports. They have a chance to do whenever they want to do such as leisure activities. For example; young people dont have to take  care children , clean  home and cook for  dinner. However; older people have to spend some time on all of these.
Second; having a joyful time in life is more related to the age.Young people have more energy than older people.They  are more energetic and physically active as compared to the older people.This enables young people to get more enjoy from life.They can go to mountains for climbing , go for skiing and go for diving. However; older people  may not  do all these activities since they can not able to find enough energy to do.Therefore; this make them not to get much joy from life. 
Finally ; it is more related to the psychology of people.Since young people have much more curiosity than older people ; they have an eager to discover new things.Young people try to get as much info as they can get from their environmet. Therefore; they have  much more tendency to enjoy the life most. In contrast; older people would not be in a mood that  they look for something new.Since they get much experience from life, they  may never find enough interest to  already discovered issues.All the above mentioned reasons indicate that life is something like for young people

This features can bring you to success easilly but these feature make also people never be satisfited. So when they reach an important target immediatly the happines for that becomes an aim to reach another new and more difficult target. For example, speaking about jobs, I think that the most successful people are not really interested in money itself but in becoming the best one on his job, without limits. I think also that there is a particolur and exacting emotion when you see that you are able to become always better and that nothing can stop you, and perhaps there are persons that feel alive only when they risk to try always something new. There is a faomous phrase that is: ""risk is my job"". It's obvious that when a common person sees someone who is rich, powerful and  that  got everything you can dream risking evertything only to try new experiences or emotions, he colud say: ""he is really crazy!"", but we know that genious and madness are often joined. We can see some examples in real life. I want to give a real simple example speaking about sports.

It is my belief that, there are several reasons that cause this situation. But, not only the young people, but also the environmental situations are the reasons of this problem. 
	
	This problem may be first explained by the changes in the young people. It is my belief that we are getting more selfish from generation to generation and starting to think only ourselves. A few years ago, when our country is in a difficult situation, everyone has the concious to do something for his/her country, but now we only think about what can we do for saving ourselves. 
	
	One of the causes of this problem is the concious that is given to the young people in their home, by their parents. The most important place where a person learns most of the things that he/she will use during his/her life is his/her home.  In the older times, parents are more careful about this situation, but as the time passes, as the problems of the parents increase about their children, giving community concious is not anymore an important problem for the family. 

	Another place, that the young people are educated is school. At school, the teachers are the people who is responsible for teaching the importance of the community and helping to these children. Teachers should give the concious, explain the good ways of helping the community and describe the positive things that they will gain by helping the community to the students. For example the teachers should explain the difficulties that the people have who have mental disordinarities to his/her students. By this way he/she can affect the students and cause them to want to help that people.  

	We should start thinking about our community again and trying for someone else. Helping someone else makes the people feel proud of him/herself and cause to feel good. If we do not help our community, we can not expect something from our community. We should think our expectations, other people's expectations and behave according to this. We should also help the next generation to gain this concious again.

     People cant just learn facts and believe everything about it, because they have to understand the idea and concept of it. For example, the world is a fact that it moves around the sun, but for logic, God who made it moves.

          The main reason that broading knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the informations that are circuld around the environment they live in.

Firstly, because of the effects of passed years all humans become old and their physical atributes fell down, for example they can not run as fast as they can before, they need more time to sleep any way they can not do what they want. their body does not let old people to do what they want. On the other hand young people have more energy, they are stronger and they can spent more time to enjoy themselves. For the reason older people lived their younger time more enjoyable their wish to enjoy themselves, become less important. Because they did these actions before and they are full of experience, the do not need to revise these action.  On contrary, young people have more interest on enjoyable actions for their life , they want to try,  they want to know consequences and they want to taste all pieces of life.

In addition , by the time and improved technology, more entertaining enjoyable conditions are provided to the new generation. they have an option of internet , rapid transportation oppotunities to be with people they enjoy  besides  more complexes such as; sporting areas , cinemas , theathers provide young people more places to spent their time enjoyable. However , these opppotunities were not chances of older people. Because they enjoyed their life with limited ways

  The first, It is problem about feelings of us, humans. We already know the eirth has a lot of enviromental problems. I think CO2 is a most famous reason of distroyeding the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how a using car is so convinience. If the famouse people or gorvanment said ""Stop using a car!!"", we can't do it.
  The second, it is problem in the developed counties. I said about the car which made CO2, but now they are reaserching some ecology cars in some company, forexsample hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometime we can see this car in my city, but it is expensive than normal cars. In the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some of people worry how we charge any enelgies. If resarchers make more serveys or think more useful ideas, those will are used more people. 
 Then, how about the developping countries. The last reason is problem of the developping countries. Some of the place in the developping county, there are no an airport or a train. The people who live in like this erea use only a track or a car. If they can not use those, they can't transport some foods or things. I think some ereas must develop to inprove own country's economy of situation, so transportations are most important to develop. And this problem is not only this. The developed countries send a lot of used car which is ofcorsed making CO2 for the developping countries too cheep.  Those will be more inreasing.This his problem is not only the developping countries bout also the developped countries.
  Therefore I dissagree.
","I disagree with this statement. I would like to talk about my opinion with 3 reasons. First, It is a problem for us, humans. We already know the earth has a lot of environmental problems. I think CO2 is the most famous cause of destroying the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how convenient a car is. If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can't do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries . I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some people worry about how we charge for electricity. If researchers make more services or think more useful ideas, those will be used by more people. Then, how about the developing countries. The last reason is the problem of developing countries. In some places in the developing country, there is no airport or a train. The people who live in like this area use only a track or a car. If they can not use those, they can't transport some foods or things. I think some areas must develop to improve our own country's situation, so transportation is very important to develop. And this problem is not only this. The developed countries send a lot of used cars which is of course expensive, making CO 2 for the developing countries too cheap. Those will be more increasing. This problem is not only with developing countries but also with developingcountries. Therefore I disagree. "

The natural resources which are used to make a car drive is petrol. The recent financial event underlines the fact that this product is harder to get and more expensive above all.  It is necessary to find other carburants for example natural oil.  But it is forbidden in a lot of industrialised countries and the need would very important, it is not sure that every car could be provided with this element. Instead of finding other resources to supply the car chain, it may be interesting to find other ways of travelling.
Moreover these ways already exist. Bus, Subway, even plane are means of travelling which can be used in a lot of areas. Some governments tend to develop these collective ways of transport. In France especially in Paris, for example, they are some days when people  are not allowed to use their cars in town. According to me this kind of action have several impacts. It reduces pollution in town, but it also make the population aware that there is no need for a car in day to day life.

For all these reasons I think that cars will not completely disappear in twenty years, but there will be different means of travelling and  certainly more ecological way of using cars.

Traveling with a guide has many advantages over traveling without guidance. A tour guide knows the area well and therefore, will guide the tourist to the most remarkable and worthwhile spots of a city. Commonly the guide is familar with the historical backgroud of the area, and will be able to explain the landmarks and the development of a metropole. Besides the well-known highlights, a guide will also be aware of secret spots and so, allow the tourist to be intoduced into the side of an area that is out of the spot light. That will not only show an often charming and different side of a city, but also completes the big picture. In addition to that, guided explorations are safer since the a person who is familiar with the area will also know the unsafe places where it is not recommended to go.
On the other hand, traveling without a guide is more of an adventure. It is up to the traveling group to explore the city and to find both, the landmarks and the secret spots. The travellers are more likely to get in touch with locals since they are not as isolated from the ""normal crowd"" within a group of guided tourists. I also believe that traveller will experience a trip differently, if it is not organized perfectly by a guide. The travelling persons can set their own pace and adjust the amout of daily explorations to their actual ability to concentrate which makes a trip less exhausting and more pleasant.

However, the producer should not make the low quality of products and spread non-sensed of the advertisement to just make people get interested and buy the products. 
	Also the reason why the companies are making the advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are is because they have confidence and pride of their products.

	If a student specialised in one specific subject, he/she will have many advantages and disadvantages facing him. Starting with the advantages, we will find that this student will feel comfortable and happy as there will be no pressure on him. Moreover, the student will know what he/she is going to specialise in as he/she get into college or university and will not the trouble of being confused later in his life.
	However, the student will face lots of trouble if the specialisation does not suit him. And if the student wishes to change the subject, this will not benefit him/her as he/she will have to start all over again and waist lots of time; and as I was once told ""time is like gold, if u do not benefit from it you will lose it"".
	On the other hand, if a student has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he/she will have less disadvantages than the advantages. Firstly, he/she will switch into any other specialisation when feels like it, if the student finds that the first one did not suit him/her without waisting any time. Furthermore, this will help the student in his/her life outside university as he/she will have lots of general and specific information and knowledge.

	Summing up all those ideas, I agree with the statement and would prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Although I will have hard time, but this will save me the trouble of facing the above disadvantages. Just as my friend once did and told me ""I do not regret it at all"".
","Academic subjects that a student takes will help him get into the school, college or the university that he wants. What subjects should a student study? How many subjects should he/she study? All these questions confuse each and every student in the whole world. If a student specialises in one specific subject, he/she will have many advantages and disadvantages facing him. Starting with the advantages, we will find that this student will feel comfortable and happy as there will be no pressure on him. Moreover, the student will know what he/she is going to specialise in as he/she gets into college or university and will not have the trouble of being confused later in his life. However, the student will face lots of trouble if the specialisation does not suit him. And if the student wishes to change the subject, this will not benefit him/her as he/she will have to start all over again and waste lots of time; and as I was once told ""time is like gold, if you do not benefit from it you will lose it"". On the other hand, if a student has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he/she will have fewer disadvantages than the advantages. Firstly, he/she will switch into any other specialisation when it feels like it, if the student finds that the first one did not suit him/her without wasting any time. Furthermore, this will help the student in his/her life outside university as he/she will have lots of general and specific information and knowledge. In my opinion the only disadvantage here, is that he/she will have huge pressure on him and will have lots of hard times. Summing up all those ideas, I agree with the statement and would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Although I will have a hard time, this will save me the trouble of facing the above disadvantages. Just as my friend once did and told me ""I do not regret it at all"". "
1126472.txt,P2,TUR,medium,"     I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people, due to some reasons. These reasons are namely; young people are more energetic, they are healtier and they do not have concern for casualities.
     Being energetic is very important to enjoy life, as it is the key to engage in entertaining activities like sports, dancing and going out with friends. I am sure that no any old person has energy to do any of these; as most of us has seen in our grand parents. The second reason is related very much to the age, due to the fact that person is healthier if he or she is young. I think this is also very related to engaging in entertaining activities; you might have observed your self when you are sick, which is a case that no body would like to go out to have fun. Due to the fact that old people usually suffer from chronic or acute illnesses, they are less likely to have motivation to engage in activities, rather they are likely to stay in bed all day.   
Approaching to the end, If we come to the third reason; which is lack of concern for casualities, I think it is appropriate to state that this is the most prominent character of young people and is the leading factor in enjoying life. When a person has a lot of responsibility to be accounted for, it will be very hard for that person to think about having fun, only thing to do in that case is to look for solutions to existing problems. In old age, people usually have to deal with their ilnesses and with their possible problems with their children if they are still living together. While dealing with these problems, it can not be expected from a person to enjoy life. Most of us might have observed this in our grand parents, especially if they are all the time ruminating on their illnesses, they are not likely to disengage their attention from these problems of old age and try to enjoy life. This might be related to a charecteristics of their age which we call as lack of energy and motivation to try hard.
     To sum up, I definitely agree that young people enjoy life more than old people as they have more energy to engage in activities that most people find entertaining, they do not have health problems that may take away the will to engage in activities, and most importantly there are not much causalities in a young person`s life that has to be dealt with; even if there are, young people have requiered energy and motivation to solve them, that old people usually do not have.

In my point of view, I believe that broading different many knowledge will give studnt the ability and the basic background to understand the real life to be able to disscuss different subjects, argue in many issues, and to improve himself. Also, be awaring of many academic subjects will give the studnt the ability to go through different fields and chose the best major he wants to drill in.
       I believe that spread more than one subject in the academic year especially in the first and second years will allow the student to be aware of what is going around his world. Studnt who is going to study about education, social studies, Politics, Arts, and may be Math will be able to understand his country and his socity peroblems and will have more ideas than a student who never heared about politics or arts and only study for his math major. 
    Moreover, students in their first year will never be able to take the right decision for their career life and chossing the major they want to enroll-in as they dont have the enough knowledeg and experiance to chose among all these alternatives.

But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves. There are many people who are successful take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some peole think that they only doing what they already know how to do well.
    
      First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. By this experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his intership. He worked as a worker in a building. During his intership, he experienced and analised how he could built a strong building. Now he has own company which is related with building structures. 
      
       Opponent argue that, successful people only doing what they already know how to do well. Good productions bring success. For this people should know how to do and  improve it. In this way, they do not need to take risks or experience new things, because they can maintain this from books. It is unlikely to be true. Books  are not enough for improvement, because they only include theoritical knowledge. In practice, experience is more neccessary instead of theorical knowledge.

Highways need to be built, housing and economics The order for producing and buying new cars is also increasing. so we can see that the number of cars will increase in the next twenty years. There will be an impact and effects on the environment by such an increase in car production. the population will increase the number  of animals and plants will be affected. in addition to that there will be a problem with movement from place to other because of crowded cars. imagine that no body can arrive at work on time, no students can attend their classes on time, no one can miss his flight. There will be delays in everything because of the crowds. and there will be many problems that will come with that increase in car production. the solutions, then will come up. But we should now start to make strategic plans to prevent this coming disaster. we need to reduce the car production to find other ways that can be used by people to travel from place to place. examples of that are using other modes of communication, like byesycles, buses, trains and airplans. using fuels which will not cause pollution and will not cause problems for the environment will be good solutions for industrial cities and big compounds also are good solutions so , the work , house, market and the sports clubs in the same building. we really need to take this subject seriously and plan for the future consistently. otherwise all of us will suffer when the time comes with not enough time to plan for our next generations that need to think about.

246766.txt,P4,FRA,medium,"I do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are. 

In my opinion, advertisements have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product. All is studied to make it attractive, brillant, colourful, nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful.
 
It occured many several times that the product was truly disappointing comparing to the advertisement. Of course, it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as ""fabulous"" as they were supposed to be.
I spent some money on various things, from CDs to a DVD player, beauty products for my sister or very diverse things, which happened to be smaller than it was said to be, less efficient or to break very easily. 
My brother, who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be. The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player, for example, is not as varieted as it was written on the box. 
Apart from the high technology, I would tend to say that advertisement does not lie so much about food products. Is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it? We can buy a television once within a couple of years, be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority, it is different from the food advertisements, or the items we regularly need to buy. Actually, if it does not satisfy us, consequently we will buy another brand.

Obviously it is important to say that it does not happen all the time, with everything, but well, I think that advertisement should not 'pretend' so much thrilling qualities over a product. However I understand it is part of the commercial system, the advert has to focus on the pros of the concerned thing and the greatest it will appear, the higher the sells will be.

945528.txt,P5,ZHO,medium,"  When asked about whether there would be less cars in twenty years than now, different people, however, have different viewpoints, depending on their personal experience, insight of the development of nowadays society and some other factors. The prediction, nevertheless, is difficult to make. As far as I am concerned, the number of cars in twenty years will increase in developing countries. On the other hand decreace in developed countries. Among those countless factors that affect my opinion, I would only explore a few primary ones as follows.

  The essential reason why cars in developing country will become more and more in 20 years is that developing countries are more likely to develope their industry as their first goal in the follwing years. As a result, car, an important criteria to show the level of the development of a developing country, will be more and more under the leading of government. A good case in point is the faster and faster growing number of cars in China. The goverment of the country has recently imported the core technology of car-manufactory from some Japaness company. This would lead to the decline of the price of cars in domestic market to encourage people to buy cars. So, there is no doubt that there would be more and more cars in China. Therefore, I believe that in developing countries, there will be more and more cars.

  And an important reason of the decrease of number of cars in developed country is that the developed coutries are paying more attention on the protection of enviroment in these years. And their public transportation system is good enough to support the growing number of people who use bus or underground. Countries such as England, Fance and the USA are now undergoing the situation I have illustrateed above.

As, what has been discussed above, you will be sure to know why I has the opinion stated in the first paragraph.

There are some reasons why I think students should know ideas and concepts but not just the fact.

First of all, students that understanding ideas and concepts can learn better and easily get interesting in that subject. For example, once studnets understand the ideas of how math work, they can do the math easier and faster than others who don't understand the idea. Also, if students knows what the concept is in a history event, they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it. They can actually learn much better than students who do not know what the concept is.

Secondly, I don't believe students would learn well if they just learn the facts. For instance, many subjects like history, geoeraphey and even science need students to understand their ideas and concepts.  If students do not learn the ideas and concepts they will not be able to good marks on the subjects. Further more, if students do not learn the subjexts well, they can easily fail the courses and lost their interests to them either in the history, math, science, and even English calsses.

Based on the two reasons that I mentioned above, I suggest that understanding ideas and concepts does lot more important than only know the facts and it does not matter in any of the subjects.

905111.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"The statment affirms that in twenty years will be fewer cars that there are today. Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies.

On one side, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. 

That possibility implies that governments will have at least to strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different a effectives means of tranport for all of them. The second compromise would be with the environment, trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but, of course, trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to a pollution problems

But on the other side, we can also view the coin by the other face. Even if the technology can be improved during the next twenty years, it will be very difficult that normal people can reach all the advances. In that case, in the non developed countries and maybe in many developing countries, the cars could keep their own place as the main mean of transport.

 First of all , many advertisements  have a really good commercials which can convince the people., like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of thoses commercials which want a sell a product can use a  naturally skinny person  to make people believe that as soon as htey will get this product they might looklike this person.For example  the increase of the production of numerous medicines to loose weight in this contry is a proof that is works but at the same  time the USA still  one of most important contry which has problem with weight.
    Second of all , ther is a huge use of celebrities in the advertissements that gives a false image of what a product is really is . For instance , the last campaing  of Proactiv Solution which is suppose to help to relieve acne. Personnaly , i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress. So when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol  uses this ' it might works for me too.So ' i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change like i tought.
  Thus  , i think that a good commercial and a use of a known person make more products look better than they are really are. People should start to stop believe in those advertissements at hundred percent because sometimes it can work and sometimes it might not.

1296943.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"     Recently, it is said that young pepople do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree this opinion, because young people of nowadays are so busy of their own things, and they are poor ability of communication, and they regard the community as not so important. 
     On the first, young people is very busy, because they need to go to prepschoop after school. In japan, the end of primary school, there are entrance examination to the junior highschool. So they need to study hard. Moreover they learn many kind of things, for example, tennis, swimming, piano, something like that... After enter university, they are busy to social life such as the party, part-time job, the date..
 There are no time to spend for their communities.
     Secondly, young people do not know how to communicate with the many kind of people. Usually they are grown up small familly, so they are not good at communicate another people except their familly or school mates. So it is difficult to communicate for them.
     Thirdly, young people regard the community activity as not so inportant. Some of them are busy for theirselves, so they think that it is useless to attend the community's activity.
    In these reason, I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. It is pitty,but it is real situation in Japan.

263985.txt,P3,DEU,medium,"I disagree with this statement. This statement isn't true for all young people. In my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping. I have been being  a scout leader for four years. I give my free time to care for children, to think about games which I can play with them and to help them if there is any problem. I dont get any money for this, I do this because I like it and have fun almost always. Of course there are situations where I am nerved and tired of entertaining children, but all bad emotions vanishes if you could make these kids happy.
So it depends on the education and the surrounding of a young peolpe wether he (or she) is willing to help his (or her) community. Not all peolpe have this social ambition that I have. I can imagine there are people who only want e.g. to get a high paid job or to be the best in the class etc. They want to obtain their goal without careing for other peoples. But I think that there were always such people who dont care. 
When I read this statment, I wonder what enough means. Who determindes what  or how much help is enough? I think there isn't a right answer. Everyone should find out for theirselves what time to help they would like to spend.
Considering jobs which are paid there are other points. All men who dont want to go to the army have to do social work for one year. They have to care for disabled humans or very poor people. My brother has to do this at the moment and he does his job at the social meeting point of the main railway station. He tells me about the different kind of people and lives he was get to know. 
I think he is doing enough for the community and his work isn't easy. 
In my opinion people who have never done a piece of social work indepent from the kind of work missed some important, character-forming and great experiences.    
","I disagree with this statement. This statement isn't true for all young people. In my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping. I have been a scout leader for four years. I give my free time to care for children, to think about games which I can play with them and to help them if there is any problem. I dont get any money for this, I do this because I like it and have fun almost always.

I strongly disagree with the view.

First of all, cars are really convinient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short.It can drives from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we are live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday.No need to stand in a line for the bus and being hurry to catch a underground in order not to be late.

Seconly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is a example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow.Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there is no transprtation to there in the past.

For the cars are comfortable and convinient, no other transportation can replace them.And it will also be cheaper in future, so having a car is the first choice of many people, just like the bikes today in China.

From all above, we can get to the conclution that cars are taking a important part in people's everyday life.Nothing else can substitute it in many aspects.So to the oppsite of the point that mentioned in the theme, I think there will more people choose cars as their first transpotation when they are out and certainly there will be more cars in twenty years.

    In first place, young people are experimenting everything that older people already did. They have more energy and fisically they are able to do, what sometimes older people can't do. 
    Older people is most of the time tired or in bad mud and they don't want to do anything. I'm not saying that all of them are like that but most of them sometimes become angry people and they live their lives so. Instead young people is ancious to live their lives and to have the experiences older people had. 
    For example, I'm a young person and I think I have such much more fun than my parents do! It is obviuos. That's because they have a lot of responsabilities and a lot of things to worry about. But for me is a lot different, because I don't have kids, I don't have to work and I don't have to worry about anything, but the school and doing my homework. I can do a lot of things they can't, for example I can watch TV on the afternoon all the time I like but my parents have to go to work so they can't or I can go out on the weekends with my friends but some times it's impossible for my parents to go out with their friends. And I think that all these things make that some persons become like that. Of course with all those things they can't enjoy life like young people do.

Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. Howere, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conpicuous aspects as follows.
The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guid lead s you to and hve no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get the access to the local people' s life and culture.Trought talinking and living with them, you hcan shre different culture and perspectives on life. That will only present you a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world.
there is another reason deserves some words here. Travelling in a group led by tutor is a waste of money in some conditions. Becuase the guide depends on the money you spent on the trip to survive. They usually convice the traveller things that have no value become the necessarities and buy them. In contrast , If trvalling along a person can use computer to get the information about the unkown place.

1258000.txt,P2,DEU,medium,"Well i think it`s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first quesiton is, what are old people, and what are young people? 
It mainly depends on the person. Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and eldery people are about 60 years old. In this case, young people have other interests than eldery people have. For example, young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music, whereas eldery people are enjoing a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the backround. But i have to mention, that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music. For example the generation who grows up with rollingstonse or ACDC still goes to their concerts. The only difference is, that young people normaly are in better shape then eldery people are. The older you are the more problems your are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can make more sports. Eldery people have to care more about themselve. Maybe young people are often more flexibel but this is also a stereotype. After my opinion this is not very important to enjoy life. Usually, Eldery people can do the same things like younger people can do if they are carefully. They even have one important advantage, because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have. If they have enough money, they can fly or travel to each place where they want to, whereas the younger ones have to go to school, to university or to work. The young people either haven`t enough money to do things or they haven`t enough time. 
Like i have written at the beginning of this text, how you enjoy life depends on your pesonaltiy and on your flexability. If you stay in life and if you stil have fun, the age isn`t so importan for enjoing life.

The older you are the more problems you are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can do more sports. Elderly people have to care more about themselves. Maybe young people are often more flexible but this is also a stereotype. After all, this is not very important to enjoy life. Usually, elderly people can do the same things as younger people can do if they are careful. They even have one important advantage, because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have. If they have enough money, they can fly or travel to each place where they want to, whereas the younger ones have to go to school, to university or to work. The young people either haven`t enough money to do things or they haven`t enough time. Like i have written at the beginning of this text, how you enjoy life depends on your personality and on your flexibility. If you stay in life and if you still have fun, the age isn`t so important for enjoyinglife. "

We can simply stay our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seems better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailer let them consider buying the products. In my opinison, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailer`s saling.
	First, we have a lot of way to get information, such as internet, or TV shows. Since these are immediate enviroment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, beause of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, less likely estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have a experience that the test I bought seems like intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at bookstore, I will not have this kinds of problem.
	Second, there are many well developed way to sell a products. They know what the customers wants. They like to buy a nice product with unexpensive price. It can be less expensive than reasonable price.  The retailer use discounts or limiting number of selling products and try to attract customers attension. In this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonalble or not rather than it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distruct the customers` attension toward price. 
	To conclude, beauce of inaccurate estimations and distructing by the price of product, we seems buy products wich are actually not as good as they expected. Therefore, we should aware of what we want, and what we need. We should think twice that advertisements are not as good as we think.  In this way, we less likely think that advertisements make products seem much better than really are.

542946.txt,P3,JPN,medium,"In Japan, some people think that young people give enough time to helping their communities recently. However, I agee with the idea that young people do not do that for the folloing reasons.

First, young people nowadays have seldom opportunities to help their communities. For example, when I was a student of secondary school in 1990, I lived in Nagoya, which is the fourth largest city in Japan. In Nagoya, there were some rules in my communiy that people had to gather once a month, and had to pick up trushes on the roads near our community. Young persons and children also required to attend the activity. It takes about two hours at one time, but I could contribute to the community. But now, there are no activity like that in my community and I hardly hear the existence of such an activity from my friends. This example demontrates that I strongly believe that there are not enough opportunities for young people to help their communities.

Second, young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their communities. For instance, when I lived in Nagoya, the neighboors were so kind that there were many opportunities to meet them. I thought that the neighboors were close to me, and that the community was important for me. I always wanted to help my own community because I felt belonging to the community. But now, the neighboors become more far away because people like to spend time more with their friends rather than with their neighboors. In addition, a sense of privacy increased now, people tend to keep a distance from their neighboors. This example clearly shows that young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their communities.

Therefore, I definitely agree with the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities recently.

I think, that young people should be asked or even forced, if they do not want to help other people. On the whole most of the young people does not spend enough time to help their communities.

Working in a hospital for a low sale can help to remind especially young people, that they will become older. For sure, they are forced to see a lot of deseases, for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness.  This experience can help to persuade younger people to spend more time to help their communities, especially their own one. Young people can change their mind, because they see, that it makes older people very happy, that their is somebody, who visit them. 

Secondly parents have got less time, because they have to cook for their childen, make the whole housework and they also have to earn the money. Even because of this fact, most of the younger students do not help their own parents. That is really scaring.  Once they will become parents and than they look back and see their bad behavior.
Changing their behavior can help them to improve the general situation.

1818733.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"Many people cannot decide whether having broad knowledge about academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for individual's career. In my opinion, people should focused on one topic and specialized in it. By having deep information and significant experiences on an issue, people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job, salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area.
First advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compare to other people. Because, companies today  generally looks for people in a specific topic. The reason for this is that today's companies are working on a detailed subject. It is clearly seen that there are not so much companies that works on differents areas. Therefore, this situation pushed the companies to find people that have important experiences and knowledge about their job.
Secondly, in today's world, if a person is an expert in an issue, then this person takes high salary compare to other employees. Because it is hard to find an expert for companies for a job position. Therefore, big companies can give high salaries to these people.
Finally, technology forces people to become an expert. The main reason for this case is that technology is developing day by day and it is not possible to have ""enough"" information about a topic. I stated that because if you want to produce something or create a product, you should have detailed information about it. By only this way, people can be creative and valuable in their companies.
To sum up, having detailed knowledge about a topic will become people more lucky than other people. They can get high salaries and they can be ""wanted"" people among companies. If people chooses the second choice, than they may not be special in the market.

	It is crucial in a students to understand ideas, as  well as concepts. If students don't understand the cocepts, they won't learn them. When students knows the cocepts because they understood it, they won't forget them. By understanding the ideas and concepts, the students have the capacity and the ability to explain to others what they know and the area that they dominate. Also, students that understand topics, have more chances of getting good grades in tests, becaus they can give more facts an example of what they understood in class. That is why it is so important for teachers to explain with examples and to give facts and make good points, so that the students can understand the area that they are studying completely. Teachers should make questions to see if all the class comprehended the point that they were trying to enphasize. When students understand the ideas and cocepts the will have better results in their exams as well as presentation, reports and other assigments. Also they will have the capacity to helps others that don't understand the area.
	For students is also important to learn facts because before they understand the concepts an ideas they have to learn the facts of the subject. By learnig the facts they learn the reasons why something happened, where something happened, why something happened and who made it happened. Facts are also really important, and teachers teach the facts so that the students learn them and understand it.  Learning the facts makes students know everything about  a topic or a subject.

I have more positive experiences in travelling with group than travelling alone.  So i like to travel with grouple led by a tour guide. Travel with group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensice.

         Usually for group travelling, one will take care of the tickets booking, hotels reservation etc. group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay. So i don't need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress. Last year,I visited India with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free. My group leader organized travelling and reservations and my tour guide take me to all the important places.

       Guide will take the group and show everything that group need to see in that area.  In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for next day events. This is so time saving. This way, i can concentrate on other things like enjoy my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meet new friend in the party etc. 

      Group travel is more safe. All ways you have some one along with you and take care of you if needed. It is easy for you to recover from sickness since somebody is taking care of you.  Especially with long trips, if  you are sick in the trip and you travel alone then it is very hard to recover from the sickness. 

       Since all the expences are shared among the group members, i will pay less money than i pay, if i travel alone.

I strongly belive that travelling with group led by a tour guide will give more stress free trip in an organized fashion with less money and more safty.

I think thet it is right  because I have never had so much memory for name, dates and fact, but I had more memory for concept and  ideas.

Dates, names and fact can be remembred reading many times the tex, but the concepts no.
Concepts must be expleined very well by a teacer, and it is important thet students can ask him some question if the concept is not so much clear .
Another very important thing is thet the teacher must be very able to explein the conjcept: he must speak slow and he must be shure thet all the students have understood whot he wonts to say.
To be shure he should ask  his students if the concept is clear every time before go on with his explenation.
The fact thet it si more important for students to understand ideas is more valid for logical and scientifical disciplines, were the most important thing is to understand the method.
Disciplines like story and geography need thet students can remember facts and name, but olso in this case it is very impotant thet students understand the concept as, for exemple, the ways for an historical fact has happened, wich are the motives thet makes it to happens.

1244220.txt,P1,SPA,medium,"Although a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons.

Firstly, if a person is focused in a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge, because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field.

Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particullarly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people knowing many things in a superficial view; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field.

I can concide that a broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff. But that is not usually the common case because most of the people work in medium or large companies. Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself. Usually a general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be insert.

We can consider also this dilemma is the history. If the modern society have promoted the broad knowledge more than the specialized one, it would have been impossible such a fantastic development.

In summary, although a broad knowledge is necessary sometimes, society had better promote deeper knowledge in the challenges that we are facing, and for that the specialization must be a priority.

And if you select any specific field like BIotechnolgy , then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself into many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc with constitiute a part Of  Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotech with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those to different fields?
Also if you have a command one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up of naive steps to really ameliorate the current state of that particular suject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will require atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,,
So, one need to go for his subject of his choice like Chemisrtry, Physics, Dynamics, fluid machnics etc ..and take that along in his or her carrer so as make that his only subject and having a ken of that subject in detail.

One Professors In Cancer Biology field spends his 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that still i cannot confidently say that what is the "" what is a real cause of unctrolled check Points in Cell Cycle""..
So above is cancer biology jargon saying that i am not able to understand that how can this be modulated a single step...
Now check example and evaluate any person or rather an untellectual on is basis thathow can he or she have command on Many subjects?
when a person is not able to get a command on single topic of his choice....
Also Refinning your knowledge could leave you very nice carrer options as well because you can never be lecturer of Physics and Bilology simultaneously...you have go to one subject and can then only be able achieve any to  pinnacle in that subject to make you pround one day ..
As we know in a scientist profession you can get into one lab and work throughout your life and never changes your field after getting or understanding the that subject.. 
So ,It is always recoommende that one should have a ken of knowledge rather try your hands in many subject and ultimately lands on just a smattering of that many subjects.

450321.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and concepts. My choice is based on two reasons.

The first reasons is that, if you learns facts, you have a direct contact with the reality. For example, in the university, you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than you follow a lesson of theory. This is a good way not only for a student, but also for a worker. In fact, if a worker has worked all of the day, he or she learn more things than he or she follows a lesson of theory.I know my uncle's experience that can be taken as an example. In fact, he has followed a course to work in a chemistry industry, but he has learn the real way of working only when he has started to work in the chemistry industry.

The second reason is that learning facts helps a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying.
For example, I remember that, when I follow the course in the ""Way of Transport"", the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken me of how a naval motor  is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built togheter. 

To conclude, I don't agree with the sentence because it is not true that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts.

	First cause, when they sell somethink to people , first they think about that to how can we sell to product. THey decided to who need this product. For example if somebody is obezit, who eats lot os food. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way how to lost weight. The person is gickly believe that , because she or he needs to lost weight. If the person sees on the televion like this advertisement, the person without think call product home.

	second cause is,the people without see already order the product. They just see on the televison. This reason is when the sellerman seela his or her product they show a diffretn kind of product. For example I many years ego Got alot of weigt and than I thougth abou that. How to lost weight. One day I was watching on the televion I see one adversisement . This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see on the person , who walk around the room. there days later my order came and that I disapointed about that , because It was realy really unconfortunable.
	I reackon when the people hear the abot product they should be search on the internet or somethink like that.It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give you credit card number already . Maybe they can get more tthan money. I think most of the adverstisement lies because my mother always this one, ""if your merchants good you do not have to call somebody to coming aroud me and take my product.

1724026.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"I absolutly agree with the statement, that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for several reasons:

First, our everyday actions are not based on facts we learned by heart but on ideas we understood. An easy example is the action crossing the street, I look to the right and to the left to ensure that there is no car on the street, because I understand that it is dangerous to walk through a street with driving cars on it since they would drive over me. If I only had learned it by heart I would have crossed a street with driving cars on it and so I wouldn't be here doing the Toefl.

Second,  you can only solve a problem if you understand the problem. You will never come to a appropriate solution of a problem just learning some facts. An example herefore is a mathematic task: Although you might have learned all relevant facts for a test you will face problems when the tasks derives from the standard tasks you have practiced in your math lessons.

Third, the recency factor of ideas you understood once is much higher than this of learned facts. I still know how to calculate the volume of a cube but I don't know all capital cities anymore.
The reason for this phenomen is easy: I learned calculating the volume through logicall thinking and not through simply learning facts.

All together for me it is proven that ideas you understood ones will help you your whole live in different situations, let it be in lessure time or in business, but facts you learned by heart, will be forgotten as soon as the test has been written.

101001.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"For some reasons we can think that young people enjoy more life than older people do. At first sight we can state this because it is clear that it is easier to be young, in good health with future perspectives than to be old, to suffer and to count the years before dying. Besides, parents often say to chidren that they are lucky. I can't deny that be old is not a very funny thing over all for the body, for the health but on the other side it implies that you have lived a lot of various things, you have found your way, you have children and maybe little children. in few words at this age, people have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasure, for resting, for what they want. 

On the other hand, be young is not such an easy thing and it is often a difficult part of life, over all the teenage period. indeed teenage is the time of self construction,the time to discover love, problems, to take the first decisions... And that is not an easy thing because teenagers don't have a lot of experience yet neither self confidence. In addition, the youth is a tricky period concerning relationships: young people are not nice between each other and a lot of them suffer a lot during this time.  Youth and more particularly teenage are transitions and changes times and for that they're not always cool and easy. You lose some beautiful things like innocence, purity, inconsciense and so on; you enter in the real world and the deception can be high.
At the contrary, older people have already made their life, they have more experience about life and thanks to that they meet less difficulties to resolve a problem.

All in all, of course i can't say that i prefer to be young or old, it is not the question but i think that every age has its advantages and its setbacks.

First, in my opinion, having broad knowledge of a lot of different subjects is very important. Somebody can be very proud to have excellent an knowlege of biology, but is it really useful for today's life? Does he live better than his relatives? I really don't think so. I think that having a broad knowledge is important to live in a society. Indeed, it's more than recomended to know about maths to look after the spendings, to know about politics when time is comed to elected a new president or to give an opinion concerning a new law... Knowing about all these academic topics that pepole use to learn at school is then definitely more useful everydays than having a mastery of one particular topic. Another important point is that some academic subjects are a guideline for people. For instance, history states the errors done in the past, and the persons who are aware of them are lickely to avoid them in the future; Generaly speaking, I would say that all the academic subjects help to live in a society.
Moreover, I wonder how can somebody evoluate, grow up with only studying one specific subject. All the topics we study in class enable us to create our personality. Without them, it's impossible to decide what we like, what we dislike... For example, learning diferent topics definitely help teenagers to know what they want to do in the future. 
To sum up, to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects  is better than specialized in one specific subjects for several reasons: General knowledge is usefull to live in the world and it helps to create the personality.

     Nowadays students don't want to do too much effort learning topics. Despite that thought,   I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. 

     One of the reasons for students to clearly understad ideas and concepts is motivation. If sudents understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the  importance  to eat healthy. Even more they will be encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eat healthy.

   Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me the example how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system. At that time I was able to learn how is the heart's work.

     Finally undertanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity. Most of the people who has discoverd new inventions have  understood the concept and the idea how things work. For example, people had to undesrtand the concept how the wheel worked in order to invent the cars. After that their creativity increased and the final product was the car. 

     In conclusion, student who know in deep concepts and ideas are able to perform easier in any field because their motivation, learning and creativity will make them to apply his knowlege in any task in life.

1123424.txt,P4,SPA,medium,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads.) make products seem much better that they in fact are. 
In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the spectations created when you finally get or check what  advertised.
Ads.  have many times very few to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss about some of them from my point of view.

First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got dissapointed with most ot the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV that in my hands.

Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worst that what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sport shoes never last me so longer than I expect from the ads.  I see and the price I pay for them.

Moreover another issue is customer service of service given to customer once he or she bought something. In ads. most of the companies focusses on their quality and responsibility.  Unfortunately most of the times you can not get easily a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised.  I faced bad experiences with the call centers of  the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in uselless reclamations.

Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads. are showed. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you rather pay attention to the person or musich announcing the item than the annonced item itself.  Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportmen or sportwoman are used in the ads.

For example, it is easy to anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on other hand it is diffcult to him to make facts. The facts are learned and existed in our life by the past experience and intentions. But the question, that is always occuring to us, how do we make idea and how can the idea  be fact?

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take riskes rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because the society is always interested in new products and it is more effective to provide new products faster compare to its competitors.
	One of the reasons that I agree to the statement is that  the costomers always aim to have new goods or survices. In the recent society that has a large number of goods and survices, people tend to be boared to keep seeing same products.

","In the world, there are people who succeeded in their business. I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because society is always interested in new products and it is more effective to provide new products faster compared to its competitors. One of the reasons that I agree with the statement is that the customers always aim to have new goods or services. In the recent society that has a large number of goods and services, people tend to be bored with keeping seeing the same products. They always want new or interesting products that are different from the others. Apple, the computer company, is one of the effective examples.

For the considering the universities ,it is unbelievable that this  problem of the university is keep going for very few years at least in my country, I think it takes a lot of year to cope this problem too. 

 In my country  the specializing in one specific subject is more spreaded  for the university,and my opinion is parallel with this idea.

In terms of the universities or in companies,this statement which  i agree with is more useful.As an instance of this situation is  that in lectures  according to a student for the  taking the course from a person who is specialized on that course is so much  educated rather than the taking  from the person who is not really interested in that course that much.In addition by this way the quality of the educating is certainly rise up.

This is also undeniable that in order to graduating from the universities you have to be successfull all over the lectures that you took in . This already means that when you finished  oyur school you already have many broad knowledge about the department you have.

Shortly this seperated educations is involve so much inefficient for the rest of life of  the students.

To sum up, by the  increasing the people who specialized in one specific subject, make our country or our world in a high position,and i think this is not a dream and this may come real .

  Even though cars pollute, I tend to disagree with the statment given by the subject : '' In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.'' I will give three main reason why I think there will be more cars in twenty years from now.

   First of all in twenty years, the Earth's population, will tend to be almost nine billion of people, wich is a overpopulation of course, so I think the more people there are the more cars there are.

 	As more and more cars are rapidly produced today,  the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportations throughout a nation. The space allocated for the vehicles will soon be not enough. Population growths directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road. Highways of hundred of metres tall will anyway be fully congested with drivers. With limited spaces or lands throughout a country, any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of cars on road, which also could cause pollutions.

	  As do the government here in Malaysia, they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road. One move that was made to the Malaysian government on to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes. By imposing heavy percentage of taxes on imported as welllas the local cars, it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find an alternative mode of transport. But this has obviously been proved less effective. This automatically brought them about to reducing the number of drivers instead. For example of an action that has taken by the government is by setting an older age line for wannabe drivers to be competant on the road.

	This delay of upcoming drivers is also supported by another wise move which like any other country, which is by improving the country's public transportation. Public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestions on the road. Take for example, the train. Easy accessibility, low and flat priced ticket and large-sized public transportation is the perfect charactheristic of a highly effective mode of vehicle which many government are vying to achieve. The most obvious example of a highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in Japan. Another example is the country, Australia that I have visited. The sight of seeing only small number of cars in the roads of Australia has clearly shown to me, as a Malaysian what my country should ought to be like. If in Austrialia, every now and then you can only hear a honk or the screeches of the tyres, I'm sure in twenty years down the road the roadway will be an empty one!

	Firstly the television has a great place in people`s life. When we come home from work, school or outside it is always in front of us and it affects us very deeply. By the television some advertisements can be seen. When something new was descovered that includes food drink or clothes its advertismenyts are always on the television and that makes people consider about buying that. It is clearly understood that  people are more interested in the products that they see on the television. If the advertisement producers make the advertisement very successfully people starts to admire to those products. For instances When my family goes to shopping, they buy familiar things and those that they see on the television screen. I am definitely agree statement about the advertisements that product seem much better than they really are. Even if the materials are poor for use the advertisements convince people to buy it and show them charming. For example last year there was an advertisement about shampoo. It was unknown and the its first year of the company. When i saw the shampoo on the television i really intented to buy it because it seems not only attractive but also popular beacuse it is known by everybody. Unfortunately when i used it many times i concluded that it is only seen better in shape not in use. After that i shared that event with my friends and almost all of that agreed to me and now all of us are careful while shopping. 
	All in all, as i explained that above, i agree the following statement. People normally cares the visuality but when they use it they understand their fault. To my mind people should be think two times when they buy something and they should not belive in attracted advertisements.

Even if the materials are poor, the advertisements convince people to buy them and show them charming. For example last year there was an advertisement forshampoo. It was unknown and its first year of the company. When i saw the shampoo on the television i really intended to buy it because it seems not only attractive but also popular because it is known by everybody. Unfortunately when i used it many times i concluded that it is only seen better in shape not in use. After that i shared that event with my friends and almost all of them agreed with me and now all of us are careful while shopping. All in all, as i explained above, i agree with the following statement. People normally care about the visuals but when they use them they understand their fault. To my mind people should think twice when they buy something and they should not believe in the attractiveadvertisements. "
884438.txt,P7,SPA,medium,"I do agree with the fact that it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to understand facts. I base this agreement basically in personal experience, but also because it has been proved that it's the best way of learning things. That doesn't mean that we have to avoid facts and leave them to concrete moments, sometimes facts are useful in a special ocassion, but it's common that facts are forgetful than general concepts. 
It's like building a house. It's important to have a toilet in the house, or a bed. But if the house hasn't got a solid structure, the bed or the toilet don't mean anything, because they're going to be destroyed one way or another. But if the structure is solid, the house will remain in its place and the toilet will be able to be in the place a toilet has to be. Sometimes, it's going to have problems, like everything and everyone, but it's going to be there. 
When a person is learning a new thing, whether if it's a new concept or a whole new subjetc, it's necessary for that person to have some clear ideas before introducing any more information in his head. The person needs a map of the new thing in his brain. The risk will be that if those general ideas are not clear, the ones that are going to come after are going to be forgotten, because the person doesn't know where to situate them. If the ideas are clear, the person is going to asimilate the facts easier and it's going to be harder for him to forget them. 
For example, about some months ago I had to learn how to use an editing program called Avid. The fist lessons that I took were a chaos, nobody undestood how that program worked out, and when the teacher showed us special features inside it, we ended the lessons worst than before, because we were able to see a whole mess of a program with no order inside it. 
In the moment we learned how to use the program, how the different formats worked, we were able to use all its special features. And not only that but now we're learning another postproduction program, and what took us about two months to learn with the Avid, tooked us three lessons with the new one, just because we had in our mind the general idea of how postproductions programs work.

First, these days young people are usually students or rookies. They have to study and work all day long and even during weekens, so they can not pay attention to their commmunities.

As the population continues to grow, so are the needs. And, car is emerging as a basic need of the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, true. The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses. This would further encourage their sale in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one.

In earlier times, cars were meant only for the main member of the family, the earning heads. While today, even children and other family members use cars for their personal needs. 

Moreover, nowadays, the two-seater sedans are in vogue. This means that if a family of four members use a single car today, they may go on to use two 2-seaters in future. 

Futhermore, the other modes of conveyance like the buses or the three wheelers generally cause more pollution than that generated by the cars. Nowadays, cars have been manufactured which use electricity or solar energy to run. The availibility of such cars at affordable prices will help, to some extent, check the, so called, never-ending pollution problem, and hence will be supported by the government of any nation.

After comming back,  they have seen my video of my bangee jump in tour and started scoldind me though i  safely came back. They are always more coutious in life and they never try for  any adventure.

1203295.txt,P1,JPN,medium," In my opinion, I admit that some people like to have broad knowledge than specialized one, but I rather like to have specialized knowledge of one specific subject.

 The primary reason of this is that people should have good or bad at academic subjects. I think it is waste of time to study dislike subject which they know they will never ever use after the examination or graduation. In my case, I had to study Mathmatics and Science when I was a first year at my highschool, but I hate them and the grade were very bad. Because of this,at the tutorial, my tutor recommended me to quit them and concentrate on other subjects, so I did and the decision was very good for me. I could use all my time for studying essential subjects for my future and I have never regret of my decision ever.

 On the contrary, I have to admit that there are some good points for lerning ,any academic subjects. The biggest one is that we can think of something from various direction. Things sometimes related each other and lies on to various subjects, so broad knowledge could be very useful in some cases. 

 However, I still believe that there are more good points in only one specialized deep knowledge than several shallow knowledge. The next reason for this is that most of the people shoud choose one specific subject sooner or later, so I think it is sooner the better to concentrate on the subject which they really like. In addition, I think it is much easier to remember or learn the things which people are interested in than reluctant to.

 From the reasons above, I believe specialized knowledge in one specific subject is better than broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

The next reason for this is that most people should choose one specific subject sooner or later, so I think it is sooner the better to concentrate on the subject which they really like. In addition, I think it is much easier to remember or learn things which people are interested in than to be reluctant to. For the reasons above, I believe specialized knowledge in one specific subject is better than broad knowledge of many academic subjects. "

289151.txt,P5,KOR,medium,"There are lots of cars today anywhere on earth, and it is clear that the number of using cars has been steadily increased by the development of techniques in making cars. Although more and more cars are still made for many people who want to buy it, I think the popularity of the car may be decreased in twenty years for the following reasons.

First of all, there are too many risks to drive a car in real life. Even though the modern cars are well-equipped to reduce the risks broken out during the accidents, it can only minimize the risk of the accidents, not prevent it from original occuring. In reality, the more cars are bought, the more accidents are occured by it. Furthermore, the risks of driving a car is much severe than we expect. If we are injured by the car accident, it might cost not only a lot of money for us to cure our body but also lots of time for us to overcome the mental fear from the accident. So, for this reason, I think many people will not use the car as much as it is used now for their safety.

Moreover, there are lots of other convenience transportation around us, especially the subway which can substitute the role of the car perfectly. These day, we use subway very often when we go to somewhere we want. Different from the beginning of the history of the subway, we are now easily accessible to the subway station near to our homes, schools, and workplace; therefore, we can go anywhere we want also by using the subway, not by the car. And the strong point of the subway is that it helps us save our time. There are so many cars on the road that it not only makes us be tired of the traffic jam but also makes it difficult for us to arrive at the place in the time we want. That is, using car can be the waste of our own time. Thus, I think the subway will be used much more than the car in the near future.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement that the number of people who use the car will be decreased in twenty years, for the reasons I mentioned above: severe risks that the car can bring and the appearance of the more convenience transportation such as the subway.

Last summer holiday, some friends with me have a travelling to the beautiful coast city Dalian, which locates in the nothereast of China. The reputation of Dalian is very good in China, and  surely we are all delitly for the chance of travelling to the beautiful city. But things not always go on as we wished. As the strangers,  we are exciting for its fatastic landscape  while arriving in Dalian. For the sake of saving money, we haven't hire a guide, and we thought a map could handle. The coming things prove that we are wrong absolutely. Soon after the exciting, the sunset s coming, we faced the problem of accomodation. The summer is the best season for touring in Dalian, thus all the rooms are reserved. At last we only ask for helps from taxi driver, and eventually he sent us to a hotel in suburan, which locates far from the city center. In the following days, we are all depressed, as a result of withouting a tour guide, we just paid most of our time from one place to another one though the transportation in Dalian is not terrible. We just searched our routine all the time. Hence, it is really a low quantity travelling.

In otherwise, if we have the travelling with a guide, the situation will be better. First of all, we can easy cope with the accomodation and routines. What's more, once we have a tour a famous place, we just know it is famous but have no sense of why it is so prestige. Therefore, if I will travel to another city or place I'm not familar with, I'll set up accompany with a guide for certain.

Travelling is just like the studying, and the guide is like the teacher, when we have problems we well ask helps from teachers, and role of the guide is the same in travelling.

First, the price of energy will become higher than today. For example, many poeple prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy. Many car makers are making their effot to produce the car which need not so much energy, thoug, such car are high cost. Additionary, there is difficulty in developing new law cost energy. As the anove explanation demonstrates, in future, people use fewer cars than there are today.

Second,  enviromental problems changes peoples way of thinking about traffic methods. For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city enviromental problems are so serious. Originaly Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had not so enough train network. However, South Korean govenment improved capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people. The govenment will continue such effort to make Seoul's air clean. Trains seems to replace the car-centric traffic system. As the above example demonstrates, there will be fewer cars in today.

Third, purposes people buy cars are more limited than before. Car is not only traffic method but also the symple of rich life. However, people will change such image on cars. For example, in European countries, where many people use cars for the first time in the world, symple cars are pupular because many Europeans think cars as just a traffic method. In old time, people in Eurpope love rich cars, though, such thinking is changing. In such situation, they don't need so much cars if there is other traffic system such as trains.

First, with the development of our society, the young people have more chance to learn about different life in this planet by TV programs, internet or another media. Young man always has a great interested in the new things. They like to enjoy different life and eager to get more amazing experience. For example, in china so many older people cost so many time to care for their grandchildren, or stay at home to watch TV. They always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again. but for young people, they can invite some friends to climb mountain or drive car to someplace, even though they have no much money. They don not want to waste their time when they are young. 

Second, as we all konw, in china the older generation must work harder and harder, because our parents were not rich and they must earn more money to support their family. they spent their time in working. when they want to enjoy the rest of life, they have already had no time or no interest about something. but now so many young people were born in good family, they can enjoy their life as they want, because their family can afford their consum.

They want to make the costumers thinking they buy the best product on earth, but sometimes the companys are cheating. In my opinion it's true, that most advertisements make products seem musch better than they relly are. The big bosses of the economy want to make the big money by selling a lot of their products. To reach their thoughts, they would nearly do everthing they could do. There are many reasons why the managers try to reach much more money. One is per example the stock market, which opens many people the possibility to be a shareholder of a company. They invest their money with the thougth to get more money back in an future time and so the put the manager under big pressure, because he's the man who has the investments of the shareholder in his hands. I think that many managers don't want to be unemployed and so they starting to find the best ways of selling. Some make their products without good quality, so that the costumers need a new one after using it a few times. The disappointment of this is, that the products are presented like unbreakable wonders which can change the world. This strategy gets a lot of monez for the company, but only the first time, because the costumers are not stupid and after buying one or two times this product they won't come back to the company with such a bad quality. So if the company wants to have success it has to improve the products, but they only do small changes and sell them the same strategy thez do the first time. In my opinion a lot of companys do it that way and that makes it very difficult to separate the good products from the bad ones. The costumers have to test the products even more clearly. Has it become that worse case? I don't think so, because the state has to improve the laws and give more rights to the costumers.

In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be an another way of transportation different from the cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future.

In my opinion, the main problem is the enegy problem; world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need more than ever. Today main enegy  source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other enegy sources, such as solar enegy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-,geothermal sources are not sufficent to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach up to a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which oparates with fuel cells are not suitable to use in the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city.

Another important aspect is traffic problem, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stays same. I believe, traffic is not just waste of time; in addition, it is waste of energy. For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour. It means that everyday I spend 1 hours on roads. I think, this can be solved by building more underground or by setting more bus routes: these all mean fewer cars.

As a conclusion, I strongly believe that there will be fewer cars in the future. Not only the energy aspect, but also the traffic problem force peole to make cars fewer.

He used to get up early in the morning and come back late at night. One day he was offered a chance or you can say it a risk.The risk was to invest some amount of money in a business.If the business works then he would become rich but if it does not then he will loose what ever money he has and become very poor.He took this risk worked very hard for the business to earn  him profits. He started with samll amount of profits then he invested that profit again in the business and kept expanding his business. Today he is one of the richest people in our society.So now we atleast know one thing that without risk their are very less chances of becoming successful.

And for trying out something new one has to take the risk to fail, or to get hurt.
This implies the fact, that successful people have to be very confident. Confidence means in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on, eventhough something did not work. Because this is what happes all the time when you risk something, sometimes it might work, sometimes you will fail.
Of course being successful does not only mean  having a big job career, one can be successful in sports, school, family, organizing life ect.
But in everything you want to succeed you have to be open for new things.If you always walk the same path like the others you will never 
step out off the mass.But walking new paths asks for alot of courage, which people can get when they get older and more experienced.
So finaly I want to say everybody has the chance to be successful, they just have to be willing to take the risk.

Confidence means in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on, eventhough something does not work. Because this is what happens all the time when you risk something, sometimes it might work, sometimes you will fail. Of course being successful does not only mean having a big job career, one can be successful in sports, school, family, organizing life etc. But in everything you want to succeed you have to be open to new things. If you always walk the same path as the others you will never step out of the mass. But walking new paths asks for alot of courage, which people can get when they get older and more experienced. So finally I want to say everybody has the chance to be successful, they just have to be willing to take the risk. "
1226973.txt,P1,KOR,medium,"   It is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good. However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree with that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons.
  First of all, most students learn a lots of subjects in the school and have exams in each semister. However, it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part. For example, i had learned many subjects from academic such as history, neuclear, and pantam physics. But i am a president of online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me.
   Second, people can learn from their peer and famliy about something like history, music or art. Most sports man who are played in Major League Baseball in the United and Premier League Soccer in the U.K. in my country have learned their specific area for their life without studying broad field. Sometimes, it is not good to communicate with others variously but it is nice to get a job and to be a prefessional. As society is getting more complex, the meanig of knowledge is more complecated. Therefore, it was to know about everythings, but, now, it is to study a vital knowledge in specific area.    Therefore, i agree with that it is better to specialize in one specific subject to get a job and to be an expert in the special field.

524381.txt,P3,KOR,medium," Many people have believes that young people today tend to spend less time to help their communities. However, I disagree with the statement bacause there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help.
 To begin with, people can devote to their own society in different manners.  Without spending lots of time to work for others, they can  dedicate themselves for the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide helps through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry to her and regreted to focus on just quantity of the feasible time. 
 In addtion, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never show one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is the example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyer in Korea. He are renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedacation for the societies. It is evident that he has limited time to make multiple things at the same time. In order to overcome this problems, he has devoted for the community in various ways which don't need to long time. He provided a huge money for poor people and no one blames him although he dosen't spend enough time.
 In brief, I strongly support that young people have still do their best for the world. They have their own ways to help others and we never evaluate their trying. For these reasons, we shouldn't overlook how they contribute to our communities just because they haven't spent a lot of time.

There should be an energy when the young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the enviroment they live.It is sad that people can't see young people to attend the activities of their communities. The reasons that make this situation are competition, education and value.

	First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate any activities. There are more stress on their shoulder, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and performance well in the school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most of the young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes.  They have to sacrifice their playing times to reach their goal. They  try to get in a public university for  the tuition are higher than before. There are many people may not afford it. What a stress on them and it makes young people can't not help their communities.
	Second, there is something wrong with education. Young people didn't get the right messages from eductions. As long people live in a place and a society, they do have responsibility to participate any activity and share their view.

First, the school focuses on the importance of volunteer works in the community these days, so that students give their more time to do volunteer works than before. For example, when I was in high school, the teachers set up the volunnteer commitee which give the information and chance to do volunteer works in the hospital to clean the rooms. In addition, the school produced the event that students pick up the trash around the school once a week. The experience of attending the volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students. That experience give me the chance to have a contact with my community. I was very busy at studying, but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities. According to the newspaper, the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer works these days. This example demonstrates that schools make enough oppotunity for students to help their communities.

Second, the community have a chance to young people to help their communities.
For instance, In Tokyo, where I live, the number of the trouble of robbers and fire accidents caused by people is increasing. Therefore, in my town, the commitee of the town decide to ask youg people to look around the town to protect the accidents during the night. I attend this activity once a week. This example also shows that the young poeple have a time to help the community because of their needs to defense by themselves.

I can understand the opinion that young people are busy of studing and eager to play the TV game, so that they seldom help their community. However, The schools and communiries make enough time and chance for young generations to help their community.

Therefore, I definetly disagree with the statement that young  persons do not use their time to helping their communities.

There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact is what a great majority of people tend to believe.  This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the medias  which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values.  For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV  we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities.
   This widespread view needs to be confronted to reality and facts.  I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplished anymore.  Indeed a lot of associations exist.  Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community. External factors explain that.
 One of them is education. when raising their children, a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion.  In this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others. They are self absorb and selfish, thinking about their own confort. It is also the government' s role to educate young people. it would be interesting to set up special programs in high schools  so as to create an interest. Stressing out the importance of the community and our belonging to it is crucial.

This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist. Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community. External factors explain that. One of them is education. when raising their children, a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion. In this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others. They are self absorbed and selfish, thinking about their own comfort. It is also the government' s role to educate young people. it would be interesting to set up special programs in high schools so as to create an interest. Stressing out the importance of the community and our belonging to it is crucial. "
625750.txt,P7,DEU,medium,"I neither agree, nor disagree with that statement. I think actually both is important. Let me give a personal story that helped me getting a conclusion towards this question.

The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideologically fundament among the facts he knows about, he will probably always have big problem to convince anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of fact-knowledge and who in fact ""did not red the newspapers"". 

Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact dont exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view. For example the former German Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schroeder was often called a big actor, a pretender. A lot of people where concinced, that he did  not  have much specific knowledge about political programms from his party or important parlamentary decisions. And in fact, I often thaught similary - until I met him one day.

It was a rainy sunday and some freinds of mine and me where walking through the bars of Berlin. Than Mr Schroeder suddenly stood at our table and asked If we  knew where the toilet was. It followed what always follows, we drank, we laughed and we where talking about politics, as soon as he was back from the restroom. But my personally lesson from that meeting was - If somebody is able to make a successfull carreer, where ever that happens, he needs to understand fundamentall ideas and concepts at first - and than he has to know facts. Mr Schroeder impressed us all absolutely because of his the huge flood of facts, that so called ""pretender"" could tell us about.

Primarily cars today are indispensible to go to work for a lot of people. Secondary cars are more than that, their use is comfortable.
What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. 
And there are no factors prospected, which could chance the need of cars during the next twenty years.

First of all cars are neccessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportion.
If you consider big citys, you can not always make use of public transportion. Especially in smaller citys, where public transportion may only exist in small or even does not exist at all and taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car.

Everyone, who ones had the comfort of owing a cars appreciates it.

Nowadays it's more difficult for young people to find a job than in the past. They must study very much and hard to increase their chances. Competition is a key point that stesses people who need also to be as more skilled as possible. So they need to attend university and more time is required to end their studies.
For the same reason, their parents have less time to look after and educate them, expecially if the mother is not a housework.
In fact, the society demand is greater than in the past in all fields, and it requires more speed. So people run from one place to another to respect their appointments.
The result is that young people are more stessed and not enough educated. My experience suggests me that this guys will grow up with many problems than people who have parents who love them and teach them how to behave.
Generally, they are more individualist and prefer to spend their time playing videogames and not helping their relatives or the community. This could lead to problems in the society that are difficult to resolve.
This is the common sense, but I don't completely agree with this thesis. There are many young people that spend their time in good activities. For esample, when I was a teenager, I frequently helped my relatives in their jobs, or the prist in the church that I frequented. I know many teenagers that every day spend their time in hospitals, or simply they help their grandparents at home.

Generally, they are more individualistic and prefer to spend their time playing videogames and not helping their relatives or the community. This could lead to problems in society that are difficult to resolve. This is common sense, but I don't completely agree with this thesis. There are many young people that spend their time doing good activities. For example, when I was a teenager, I frequently helped my relatives in their jobs, or the priest in the church that I frequented. I know many teenagers that spend every day in hospitals, or they simply help their grandparents at home. "
1144447.txt,P2,KOR,medium," People usually say that young people are the future of our socieies. It is because they have much more time to think about their rest of lives and their futures. In addition they have a lot of opportunities to learn and try what they want. Moreover, young people are usually very healthy to do something hard thing that they face on. Therefore, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more that older people do.
 Firstly, older people have less time to consider and already experienced many things that can enjoy their lives. Young people are literally 'young', so they have lots of time to think about their lives. Also they have much more opportunities to learn and try what they want than order people. For example, young people have a lot of dreams in their futures ,so they are always consider what they really want to be. Therefore, they spend a lot of time to learn new things that they have never experienced, but older people already experienced most of things in their lives so not a lot of things are left for them. In addtion, young people have enthusiasm to try new and hard things which can definitly enjoy their lives. Although things are hard and difficult have have youth passion to figure out but old people are not really facinated in difficult and dangerous fields. 
 Secondly, older people are not often healtier than young people. For instance, older people can not run as fast as young people. Therefore, although older people want to hike Rocky Mountain, they can afford to hike as much as they want. On the other hand, young people are very healthy to try whatever they want, even though things are very difficult and dangerous. In addition, although they get injured, their bodies are easily get better than older people.
 In conclusion, young people have much more time to enjoy their lives such as thinking about their future, learning new skills and experiencing new things. Moreover they are heathy to enjoy these new experiences and skills than older people. Therefore, young people enjoy their lives more than older people do.

200229.txt,P3,DEU,medium,"I strongly disagree with this statement, as i do not see why it would be correct. It contains no arguements to support its claim.

Young people do give enough time to helping their communities nowadays, as they always have. I do not see the reason for elders to belive in this statement, or to view our youth in a critical manner. Yes, the youth might be somewhat different than the generation of people they grew up in, but it does not need to be different in a negative way. Their criticism merely demonstrates their inability to take responsibility or to adapt to recent events, which would bring about a difference in mentality in the next generation. 

Most probably people making such a statement are not satisfied with their own contribution to their communities and will try to ease their mind by making such a claim. Often pensioneers who have nothing better to do, i.e. make no contribution to their communities, make such a claim.

Therefore the person putting forth this statement is not helping his community in doing so. 

This statement is so broad, that it is hard for me to think of any specific examples out of my head, but in general, the young people are the people which drive a community and contribute to its culture by their motivation. 

This claim is nonsense. It has no arguements to support it and is terribly broad.

913962.txt,P1,DEU,medium,"In my opinion the statement is true. Actually everybody should have a wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects than to specialize in only one field.

First, if you have a wider knowledge it will use yourself a lot because it supports you in the admission for the universities or in a future job. A lot of people will know after talking to others if somebody has a wider knowledge or not. And if you have an interview for a job or an admission interview at university, your knowledge can lead you to your goal a good job or admission.

Second if you have a good knowledge you can understand much more subjects and world problems than if you would not have it. And that will make your world more interesting. Also can you assist by questions from your friends, parents or relatives and that gives you more self confidence and makes you more and more a respected partner. Also will it develop your logical thinking and this point will lead to a greater knowledge again.

Futhermore, a good and wide knowledge will rest you a live time. And I think the more and more people learn and know about academic subject, there life becomes more interesting and they will also discover new interestings. Like the museum, theatre, read the newspaper, books etc. This will make your world more colourful as if you only would live in your four walls, with your sole specialized subject. What if you will meet other people who do not know anything about your specific subject, which interesting discussion can you lead. 

To sum up, I prefer having a broad knowledge of many academic skills than just be specialized only in one specific academic subject. I think it is the better way to lead your life. Because your knowledge can help you anywhere and in any situation.

It is a generally considered that almost all products of new technology are accepted, mastered and being used by young people first, so do the ones to provied convience and enjoy. Young students, for example, have used to communicate with cell-phones while their grand parents still use old and big normal telephone. Although airplane has been common in China for tens of years, some older people still refuse to travel by airplane, for they think it is dangerous and a waster of money. Old people refuse to or don't know how to use many new products and can hardly receive benifits from modern society than young people.

Besides, it is obviously that young people are the natural leaders of the new fashion, and it is also a common sense that entainment, which is highly development in modern cities, are always first accepted by young people. For instance, while I went to bars with my friends in my free time, my mother merely stayed in home with doing nearly nothing even she had enough free time. Only when she was invited to a bar by her younger friends, she found it really a good place to get released. Another fact is that a recent social study indicates that less than 70 percent of people who live in big cities of China receive benifits from new technology, and few of them are old people whose age is above 55. 

Moreover, enjoying life does not only shown on using the new products and enjoying entainments, but also the activities in society. The social concept of older people are not OPEN enough even though the freedom and democrate of the society is progressing rapidly, especially in China. Several researches have evdiently pointed out that the people who is older than 48 are hard to accept the new concept of the society, and by this they can hardly enjoy the real freedom and democrate, which plays a important role in young people's daily life. From social activites I can release myself and win admire from others, which is essential to keep me feeling well. Unfortunatly, my grand parents can not enjoy all of these.

However, in my opinion, it seems clear that young people do not give enough time for helping their community; they are too busy and they are affected by biased information.

However, since he has to prepare for applying to the university he wants to go, he cannot give enough time to helping other people. In this way, being busy is a great obstable to helping our communites.

Second, they have longer time in rest of their lives than the older people do. Third, older people tend to say that the younger the better.
     First of all, young people have healthier and stronger body than older people do. They can continue to work longer, run faster, need shorter time to sleep, and so on than the old people do. That means young peopel can enjoy what the old people can not do. For example, they can swim in the mornig, go out for lunch, go shopping, and have party with their friends.
    Second, they have longer time remained in their lives than the old people do. If you want to be a very good and famous doctor, it will take about ten years to attend medical school and get enough experience as a doctor. Young people can plan and achieve this aime because they have time. However, old people may not beacuse they only have limited time in rest of their lives.
    Finally, I often hear old people say that the younger the better. I am still young and can only imagine how the lives of old people. The old people, however, experienced life of young people already and say the younger the better comparing their lives to the ones when they were young.
    To conclude. I believe young people enjoy life more than old people. They have strong body to do anything they want while old people have limitations because of their health problems. Also, young people have longer time to do anything. In addition, old people admit that the younger the better. I strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than old people.

                           On the contrary, even if a young person might help community, he or she cannot do it because they have not time for this purpose. Infact, usually school steals much time to students and free time is not fair to help community. At the same time a person must enjoy her or himself in free time to not explose!. 
                           So, if a person wants to help community he or she renounces to free time and this question is very difficult to deal with. Infact, after an hard week of study I believe that a young wants to go out with his friends or make some sports.

The lessons of this organitazion are made at Monday and Friday evening in a period that I have to prepare exams and I cannot follow lessons. So, I did not follow my purpose for school reasons.

I am very sad for this, but after a week in a place not near to my home I want to visit my friends for example or to play tennis. 
                         So, I believe that if school needs less time youngers can help community but in these conditions are very dfficult to realize it. A purpose that can be made is to put in scholar schedules voluntaries activity like Red Cross or to help in hospital. It might be a mode of stimulating youngers to be near to their community.   
                 
","In my opinion young people have to help their communities because in this mode the youngers can improve their personal experiences and this fact is very important for every work that they will do. On the contrary, even if a young person might help the community, he or she cannot do it because they have not time for this purpose. Infact, usually school steals a lot of time for students and free time is not fair to help thecommunity. At the same time a person must enjoy her or himself in free time to not explain! . So, if a person wants to help the community he or she renounces free time and this question is very difficult to deal with. Infact, after a hard week of study I believe that a young man wants to go out with his friends or dosome sports. In my personal experience, I wanted to join the Red Cross because I think that it is an important organization to improve our society. The lessons of this organization are held on Monday and Friday evenings in a period that I have to prepare exams and I cannot follow lessons. So, I did not follow my purpose for school reasons. Another experience in my life is related to Church activities that I do not want to follow because they are held on Saturday afternoon and this is the only free day of my week.

525210.txt,P7,JPN,medium,"  I disagree with the statement showing ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts"".
  For example, why do all of us deeply study about history? This is because the knowledge of facts which happened in the past may lead us to think of how to think or how to act, now, and in the future. There is a famous Japanese sentence shown as ""Open your future by learning from the past"". This exactly explains why it is important to learn facts.
  Furthermore, I think that any kind of idea or concept is created by an event or fact which happened in the past. For instance, the idea to launch the United Union, involving all nations in an organization to build an organization for them to solve national conflicts by preventing war, was created after the big event, the 2nd World War. After learning that this kind of war means nothing to whole of the world and all of the population, the genius leaders had reached to this idea. 
  Therefore, I think that it is also very important for students to learn facts as much as understanding ideas and concepts.

So if we want to responde about this question we can tell that the image of a product it's very important but it's only a vision fact. So I agree with the topic.

The advertisements make products seem a good image, so the people are involved to buy these. They show us the best quality of products and not the reality. An example is if you want buy a car you see that this car is the best for speed, or elegance, or horse power, or other characterists but you don't see what is the consume, if the power of this car is economicaly good. 

But the advertisments are in all our life, becouse if you watch TV shows or programs there are many break of advertisements, if you read a newspaper there are pages and pages of advertisements, when you go to work or only you go out in the streets you can see more and more advertisements. So they are a subliminar message. And the power of its is that can seem products better than really are.
     
However, the advertisements are most important for the economy because a good advertisements can make some profit for the industries. But the buyers have one thing from their side, that the product is much far from reality they can't buy it. 

In conclusion I'm in accord at the topic but i tell to all the people of the world that not are impressionate for the apperance of an advertisement but see the really quality of products, that we can change something in the world.

23292.txt,P7,ARA,medium,"I disagree with this statement because without learning the facts it can get you nowhere. Ofcourse, some people think that without facts it won't take too long to find out, but what if they didn't know if they were right.
To put it this way, say that you want to learn something in biology in plants, animals, fish, reptiles, insects and mammels. To know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book, you can read through the main facts and details that was given to you. If you want to know something or investigate you need the facts about each topic that you were given in your biology book. If you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem.
Also, another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened, example who killed someone or who is the one responsible for commiting a crime. To find out,you need to ask yourselves: ""How did he or she died and who killed them?"" The questions will be answered if you gave in every information you have gathered when you  want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people. Either if this person is guilty or not guilty.
Life is not easy on how it sounds when it is important for students understanding ideas and concepts but a faculty is the way that shows what can be featured and how can you explain it. 
Given through what the topic is about, to me, I think it's a good way to have facts better than to ignore them. It helps me learn alot when they were given to me and preparing to answer that I choose this because it is best to find out more than hesitating to answer it.

Advertisement is a way for the companies to show their products to a large number of consumers. They are the must of a modern life. In a modern life the demands of the people increase as the world changes. The demand can be of new tools, machines, cars, houses and any other things that you can imagine. As the people need more of these the producers and companies make new tools and machines and ideas to attract people's attention. In a growig world you don't have the opportunity to reach every people unless you do not advertise your product or idea. To appeal more and more people an advertisement must show all the good sides of the thing and should not mention about the bad sides of it. 
I am sure that you are familiar with the situations such that people coming into a problem with anything he or she can buy  by just believing in the advertisement. Cellular phones are a good example, I had friends who chosed their cellular phones according to the great advertsement done about that item, but most of them were not happy with the product they bought. 
As I mentioned before, the logic of the advertisement is selling more and making more money as a consequence. As long as the reason is making more money, the companies will not interested in the consumer's approval for the short term. They will try to sell more and to do this they will need advertisements that are lacking the disadvantages or bad features of their products.

	The first reason why i do not disagree that statement is that It is depends on what is personalty the people have. there are young people who does not really like to do something and just be alone. I do not think they are really enjoying theirn life. On the other hand, there are some old people who really like to go out and hang out with their friends. my host mother is an example of old person who enjoys her life even more than me. she is in her 60s now and she loves to go out with her friends and go shopping. when she doen not have work to do she always make a appoinment with her friends to do something. she never like to be home all day doing nothing.
	The second reason is that there are lots of things that allow old people do but not for young people. generally old people has more time and money than young people have. young people have to study if they are still in school. and they get certain money from their parents so they do not really have lots of money to go out all the time. for example, my mom and dad love to travel other countries with their friends and they do have money to afford it. Of course I want to travel with my friends too but i do not have money for it.

Another example in which facts have to be strictly related to ideas is for example if you want to descride a marketing concept to a student.

  First, traveling alone enbles us to feel free to move on tour site. Some people may think that moving new places alone is dangerous because we do not know about the places. In my opinion, However, traveling alone can  benefit us to have more chances to see sight seeing. For example, If I tour with other people on scheduled, I cannot see museums and churches that I wante to visit exept determined sites. Then I do not feel satisfied with the tour. In this way, I can say that traveling along give us more chances to visit than traveling in a group.
  Second, when it comes to making new friends, moving alone greatly contributes to making it possible. it is generally agreed that traveling in a group is difficult to make new people as they have to move scheduled the sighteeing sites. However, when we are free we can meet other people that may be  traveling people or local residents. If they are residents, we can get more detail information on the place. It will be more helpful  to take a trip alone than traveling in a group led by a tour guide. 
  To sum up, Traveling alone is better way to treveling in a group by a tour guide in that we can have more chances to visit freely  favorite places and meet new friends who can give useful information about the new places. All things considered, I can definitely say that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way  as the advanteges of traveling alone mentioned aboved.

It will be more helpful to take a trip alone than traveling in a group led by a tour guide. To sum up, Traveling alone is a better way to travel in a group by a tour guide in that we can have more chances to visit favorite places and meet new friends who can give useful information about the new places. All things considered, I can definitely say that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way as the advantages of traveling alone mentioned above. "

          ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"".
 
      I disagree with the above statement because, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems to be alright when in childhood, but this seems to be complex and cumbersome as we grow older and older. 

     Firstly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly. For an example, consider a high school student. If he needs to have a broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school, apart from his personal interest which he shows at a particular subject, the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome.

      Secondly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, the frequency at which we do get update about these subjects greatly matters. We need to have a greater frequency of updation in all areas, which is not a simpler task. For an example, consider a student studying Computer Sciences. The other academic subjects include some main aspects from Electronics, Electricals, Communications and like wise. The frequency at which he gets updated in his core subject(Computer Sciences) slows down if he needs to have broad knowledge of other academic subjects.

      Thirdly, having broad knowledge of other academic subjects do helps, but not at a considerable rate. Considering the example illustrated in the above(second) aspect, the student could hardly get bugs in other areas which he integrates with his core subject. In recent days, debugging mechanisms are in plethora and it can be said that a person need not have a broad knowledge of other academic subjects.

         Considering the above reasons, I conclude that I disagree with the given statement.

When I was young everybody said that in the year two thousand everything was going to be different and that what I've said above would have already happened, but these didn't become true. Nowadays things are quite similar to what they were twenty years ago.

Cars are so important in our lifes that we cannot live without them. Nowadays we need our cars to transport things, to go to many places where public transport don't go and to feel a bit more free.

On the other hand, it's true that if public transports became cheaper and quicker, many people wouldn't need their car, and they would take public transport, but, what about feeling free?

Our society needs to feel really free, and to feel that they can go wherever they want, whenever they want. We are absolutely under control in our cities and in our countries and, as I think, cars give us this bit of freedom that we do not have in many other parts of our lifes.

For all this reasons I think that in twenty years, there won't be fewer cars in use than there are today, although I do think that the number of cars won't be growing so quickly as it is growing today.

It is probably the only means of transportation combining speed, 24/7 instant availability,  high standard of comfort, security against attacks and possibility to reach in a decent number of hours any withdrawn place in a country.  All other long distance means of transportation make you dependent on departure times, exasperating delays and complicated correspondances.

	Advertisements make people think that the product is a neccesary item.

542386.txt,P2,FRA,medium,"To answer this question , i will organize in two parts. The first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people, and (even if i'm not so old) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than youngers.


 We all remember the first time , the first time we made love, the first time we went to highschool, the first time we smoked a cigarette. I think this is one of the reasons we might say younger can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders, just because everything they do is knew. Teenage is the period where you hqve lots of experiences, it's an adventure, you discover all the time. I remember my teenage. It was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i've experienced during this period. i was always going to partys, when i was 15 me and my freind would go to night club  and everything has a important impact on me because it was knew.  An other argument is that young people have no reponsability : they don't have money problems, or job problems or even children problem, there parents take care of everything so they don't have to worry about all those things that makes life difficult.

But in contradiction with all that i said before, i would point that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way.
adults have a larger experience witch gives them a knoweledge young people don't have. Having this experience they can appreciate things young people woudn't even care about. It's hard for me to give exemples because i don't consider myself as an complete adult. But maybe adult can enjoy very infime things like a good glass of an old wiskey for exemple. One day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like. I think old people, as they know more about life, can enjoy it even more.
On more point is that young people don't have the time to establish important projects. What is life about after all? i think life is about being happy and making such as wonderfull things as children. Adults have the oppurunity to live this kind of wonderfull projects. They have the opportunity to make plans. The plan of creating a society, the plan of creating a family.

If architecture has broaden knowledge of other academic subjects , then it would be better for making building.

These conditions make people able to do many things like studying, playing sports, drinking alcohols and etc. For example, when sportsmen get old nearly 40, they usually retire because their physical conditions are not strong enough to continue that job.

Not only can we develop our social skills, but our thoughts are getting bigger. We can see other sides of society too. For example, there are many students who have a double major in my school. They can meet many students who have another major, and they know many professors. I think it is very helpful for students' futures. Furthermore, knowing many subjects, we can apply one thing to another. I think most subjects are related, and they have an influence on each other. If we know one subject accurately, it will help to understand other subjects. Hence, broad knowledge of many subjects is good for understanding many things. From my personal experience, when I was in high school, I solved many mathematics questions. From this process, I could also develop problem solving skills in society. I can use mathematical knowledge to solve real problems. To sum up, knowing many things has several advantages. It is good for a person's mind, also living in modern society. There is an old saying that ""Knowledge is power. ""We have to know the meaning"

Indeed, a person who have different skilled can easily understand different point of view in a company. This understanding is really necessary for people who is an manager.

For example he has to take financial decisions which are really important in a company if he does not take in account all the advantages or drawbacks of his decisions.
The survey of the company can be in danger. 
Moreover, we can take the example of an individual entrepreneurs as a director of a restaurant. If the director do not have knowledge in cooking, the cooker can do everything he wants. This kind of advantage can be dangerous for the director because he does not really understand all about his own restaurant. I think that sometimes is really necessary to have knowledge in different types of subjects even if we are specialized in on or few specifics subjects. 
Furthermore, it can be really interesting to somebody to have different academic sujects not only for working but to his own. 
As for me, I think we can have both, knowledge of many academic subjects and be specialized in on specific subject. Both can be an advantage, a strenght. Everything is changing so fast so people have to understand rapidly why and how things change to take efficient decision for a company.

The choice, nevertheless, is not easy to make. However,  from my point of view, I would like to believe the later one is more reasonable. For there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now, my arguments are listed as follows.

A essential reson can be seen by everyone is that the gas released  from the cars in big cities pollute the environment around us seriously. According to a recent survey accounced by the A dminister of Health of China, the cars gas pollution accounts 38.7% in the total pollution which harm our environment. This strongly demonstrates that the cars pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be less cars used in our lives.

	First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan for anything because tour guide know everything what to do or where to go. It saves you  time and you don't have to get stress from planning for trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide  where to go and what I want to see during  my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go, you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning for trip, you already earn so many things and experience.
	Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice for what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide already sets up for the group. When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended. I am sure tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat, but you have no choice eat something else. Even for the food, I want to research what is the most popular food in that country and I will figure whether I can eat this food or not. If not, of course I will look for another place to go. 
	For the last, traveling is all about the experience the new thing from new world at least I think. I don't want to have a same experience what other people have. With group touring, you have to go same place and take a picture from certain place like others. Whole group will have same memory from the trip.

First, a company that launch a product cannot possibly find a large scale of custumers without promoting it. Therefore, a company needs advertisments to exist or to continue existing. With the laws of competitions, the advertising is in a way self-controlled. As we saw last week with ""L'Oreal"", a company cannot say anything in an advertisment.

Second, the companies usually ""lies"" about their product because they won't tell you immediatly the side effects or problems you might encoutered with the use of the product. Advertising will sell you the good effects of the products.

Another thing which is the harmfull result of second idea is loosing the way on academic life istead of being creating man for the science.

	Thus, it is better to specialize on a subject than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
","Specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. There are many reasons which support the first idea. Firstly, motivation is a very important factor in the academic knowledge process. When a person is interested in one subject he can protect his or her motivation for academic study. Secondly, keeping an order, combining the information about the subject makes a person expert and helps him or her to use and outsource. Thirdly, coordinated and specialized information is always helpful for a person. It also brings happiness and welfare to an individual's life. Another important reason is creating new theories or inventing new things. orders and specialized knowledge can easily produce new ways, theories, inventions etc by the help of its scientific history and experience.

              for example if the student is working on a project  related to the  subject  he is studing,then it is allways  better for him to  understand  and  learn the facts  of that particular  subject  than  just  getting the idea  about it . by learning the facts  he could allways   produce  more information or the real  work .If the project is  about   the topic in science.Like  the   importance of nutrition in a human body.Then it is better that the student understand the real facts  of the importance of nutrition in humans and then he can create some ideas while doing some reserch  on this topic and finally come to a conclution and understand the concept of the  topic itself.
                 furthermore,I would say that  if the student  has only some ideas about the importance of nutrition in a human body then he would not present  a good  and complete picture of  the  topic. thereby giving a superficial  idea  of the topic.And make it look verry  simple.another example is if the student  is  studing  studing in a medical college  and attending an  anatomy class, then he  should realise and know  all the facts  of the  parts of the human  body , and also the importance of them.If he has just the idea  and  understand the concept  of how the organs work then it would 'nt  help much in getting the entire information and  working of the human system.

One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts  always explore the new area of growth for us.When we try something new we learn about that field which help us to grow.Take my wifes example.She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up.At mis of her life she tried with an attempt to work as a beutician.Surprisingly she got tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty salloon.Successful people never stick to one profession.
Other reason ,I believe that taking risk and trying new things bring success is because it bring creativity in person which leads to success in life.When we try new thing in life then our brain works more faster and we feel more challanging.Anil Ambani is the biggest example.He had a creative mind who always tries to do something new ank taking risk.He kept on trying new business in india and doing excellent work.His this habit has made him most successful business man in India.

I believe that it is impossible to have less cars that today.
One reason i believe that will not be fewer cars is because to have a car means to be indipendent, and who want not be indipendent ?
i mean that in a normal family evreyone want to have a car, for instance a car is necessary fot the husband to go to work, another car is necessary to the wife to go either to work and  make shopping, and we cannot forget sons or daughters.
So the situation is very prevedible, if everyone want a car , the number of these cars wiill increase in the future.  
Another reason i think there will be more cars in the future because  a car is looked like a stutus symbol.
For example who has a expensive and sportive car ,like Ferrari , wants to show to other people that he or she is a rich man or woman.
another reason i think that there will be more cars is that today as in the future there is the opportunity to chose your favourite car, i mean that there are a lot of kind of cars and a lot of brands.
Automotive factory  are trying to satisfy customers needs with specific kind of cars and give to them the possibility to chose almost everything in a car, for example the colour and the material of the seats , the colour of the whole car,and also the model of the engine:diesel or not.
As we can see people can obtain its whises realized and often without paying a lot for a car.
In conclusion in the future the number of cars wiil be higher than now,because peole need to be indipendent and choosing a customized car is not anymore difficult.

Most  young peope have to work and it is difficult to take a vacation. However most retired older people have a lot of time, the y have some money to enjoy their life because  they are getting retirment money from gobvermant.

Risking can be frightening - I will not deny it. However, if you do not risk, you miss important opportunities to improve your condition. Every decision in life, from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime ones, implies some risk. If you are not able to take risks, this means that you are not able to take challenging decisions, with the obvious results. 

Furthermore, in certain situations, taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she has (but might regret what he or she has not) and someone who is really satisfied. Just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer which requires moving to another country: should he stay home and try to find an average job or accept it? I am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away, otherwise he might simply regret it for the rest of his life.

On a less personal level, there are contests where trying new things is almost mandatory. This is the case for example of researchers: questioning the status quo, trying out different possible solutions is necessary in order to find out new things - and where would the world be wihtout new inventions? I cannot imagine a researcher who does not want to try new things.

For all these reasons, I am conviced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking. People who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out opportunity - because that is what a change really is.","Taking risks and trying new things have in common one thing: they are scary or, at least, they are not as comfortable as doing the same things always.

In my opinion  i agree with the statement  because  i think that in a  few years there wouldnt be as much cars as now because  other  confortable and faster ways  of transport will be used, as for example   the plane that its at this moment one of the best way  of transport or  another possibility is using   cars that works with solar energy or with  water  contribuiting  with the environmet.

On the other hand the car is the most common way of travelling of most of the people. People uses their cars a lot becuase is the most cheapest transport and you can use it wherever you want.
Also the car is very comfortable. The problem of this is that people should try to be concerned about the advantages or disadvantages of using the car or another transport.

As far as i'm concerned numerous scientist are investigating new methods and ways of travelling.
Scientist have made predictions about the future saying  that  by a certain period of time  there will be fewer cars  and  instead of using gasoline  in the cars use another alternatives ways.

 As a matter of a conclusion , in the future there will be fewer  cars because people will try to travell in a fastest and confortable way than in a car and also be concerning about helping and not  contaminating the environment.



","Nowadays there is a controversy about using your own car or using public transport. this is a consequence of environmental destruction and the pollution of the earth caused by numerous actions that humans take. today there are a lot of organizations that are very concerned about the pollution and the damage to the environment.

1916426.txt,P1,KOR,medium,"Nowadays, the more the students are educated, the deepest knowledge they will have on their subject. However, some of them may have two majors. Which idea is good? In this essay, there are several reason why I do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. 

First of all, everyone has got the same time. In other words, the condition to have an amount of study may be the same to everyone. 
If you spend all your time on a specific subject, you can impove a lot rather than the person who spend his or her time on two subjects. This is because he or she should devide the time. Let us assume that there are two students and the same time is offered: A person who only does economics and B person who does economics and politics. Compared with A person, B person would know about politics more. However, A person would know about economics more deeply than B person. 

Secondly, in the sense, broad knowledge of many academic subject can be useful for normal lives. However, you would lose the competetion with others who specialize on a particular subject. A firm is a group of all the specialized people on their people. In the other words. there are several teams and sub-organizations classified in a firm. it does not need one who has got narrow knowledge. For instance, every unversity has got many departemts and would 

accept the person who really want to specialize his or her faviourite subject .

1176638.txt,P6,ZHO,medium,"Nowadays, there are numerous debates about the issue whether or not the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some people hold that travelling individually is better. Others, however, contradict it. From my point of view, I firmly agree that travelling in a group is the best way for the following reasons.

To stand with, travelling in a group will be much safer. In other words, if people have a trip with other people, they will feel much safer. A survey in the Toronto Star talks about that travelling individually will be more dangerous than travelling in a gruop. For instance, when I am travelling in a group, if I have any problems or dangerous, the members who are in my tour group will help me out from the problems.Therefore, travelling in a group will make people feel much safer.

In addition, travelling in a group will  make people spend  less money. That is, people will spend less money in travelling in a group than travelling solely. The reason is that the tour company will have so many discounts about the hotels, the restaurants and the entry to  famous places. A person who is travelling in a group, for example, visits to China just need to spend $400, while anther person who is travelling individually should spend $800. Hence, travelling in a group will be cheaper.

Finally, travelling in a group will make you visit more places. In other words, when you are travelling in a group, you will have a chance to visit considerable more places. You will be a stranger when you travel to that place, so you won't know which places are worth for you to visit. If you join the group when you are travelling, you will visit dramatically more places. Consequently, travelling in a group will make people have a chance to visit more famouse and beautiful places.  

Based on what I have discussed, it is self-evidence that travelling in a group is beneficial for people. Travelling in a group will not only make people feel much safer, but also let people spend less money and have a chance to visit more places as well.

1161147.txt,P3,HIN,medium,"I agree with the given statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. 

The possible reason for this kind of behaviour could be lack of concern for their communities. Young people are more enthusiastic and are more busy with their daily lives. Most of the times, as they argue, they do not have time for such activites. But this assumption is appears to be false. They can definitely devote time for this cause. It entirely depends on their disposition. By devoting even an hour for the improvement of the community they can help the community a lot. 

The younger generation thinks that the community is meant for adults and they are the ones who should work for it. But they are mistaken. They do not know that how their help may be beneficial to others. 

The younger generation considers playing games, hanging out with friends and going to parties more important than their participation in the activities of the community. They consider the community activities monotonous and mundane. They prefer ,say, going to a movie or playing basketball over serving to community. They believe that they can have a lot more fun rather than being stuck up in working for the community. They do not realize how important it is to help their neighbours and all they people associated with the community. 

Perhaps, a possible reason for their reluctance may be lack of knowledge of pros and cons of having a community. Adults, on the other hand, have more concern for their communities. They know its importance more than the young people do. They are the ones who can inspire the young people by telling them the importance of these communities, their advantages and disadvantages. If every youngster devotes even an hour to serving the community, they can help a lot.

 Likewise, the place i'm living now Singapore is the very country which succeed in reducing the number of cars. The high taxes included in the purchase disgust the buyers' taste of getting a new car. Not only the tax included in the buying process but taxes such as ERP, those which are paid when cars are passing the city area, are having great success in making people using less cars.

i perfectly agree with this statement because i think that young people is always completely involved in their own life and in their passions.
I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfactions from other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past.

At universities it is important that students do learn the theory of the subject in order to gain a basic knowledge in this sector. Unfortunately they do not experience a lot of the practical site. Apprenticeships are on a volunteer basis at most universities and most of the students use their free time off in the semester holidays to have fun instead of working for companies and doing trainees. However, in the time after having finished universitiy it is of high importance that students can show their future employees that they do know more than the pure theory.
In the daily working life it is neccessary that one is able to work independently and furthermore is able to combine facts,own ideas and concepts.
Most of the people leaving school think it is easy to study at university as they only have to learn facts which are provided from the professor. But nevertheless studying at university is more. Only people who show the ability to think and work independently are those who are highly skilled and later on qualified and contribute to the success and progress of economy.

Moreover, if someone focus only one specipic subject, he or she might be biased without balace.

     First of all, I strongly believe that  people who are living this period should have wide knowledge of many acadcemic subject. The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others. When it comes to biotechnology, people are eazy to think that it has no relationshio with philosophy at all. However, when I wached the some SF movie, 'Island', I deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives, so called gernorm project, is reasonable and ethnical. It is a problem of philosopy. This example shows that these two academic subjects are very imtimate each other. 

     Secondly, If someone commited only on only one specific subject, he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balancing. This is because I believe that academic areas originated from one subject, which was not divided like now. As society began to divided and specialized, the academic subjects began to separated too. However, nowadays, there are new tries to combine the separated  acacemic areas for more academic progress. For ecxample, to cure patients, doctors are working with sociologist because the reason that  patients suffer from disease come from not only health illorder, but also social problem such as too much stress and envirionmental pullution.

     In sum, without any hesitation, I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects that to specialize in one sucject,  All in all, academis in one.

854456.txt,P1,TUR,medium,"In my sense   it is better to specialize in one spesific subject  in a globalised renovative and inventive world namely in today's world as an exper in a specific subject.

Twentieth and this centuries have been the leading centuries in technological enhancement and  progress. so much information is being circulated so fast that sometimes  it is very  difficult to fallow up the developments. In suzh an environment it is more useful and efficient for person to specialise in a  specific topic and improve himself in this field. 

To me we have to specialize since this is the only way to go in this century. Just giving an example you can not go to a doctor specialised in the heart illnesses for  a headache you are suffering. The very broad range of fields in medicine requres doctors to specialize in one of those fields. We can consider this requirement for all of other sciences namely social sciences maths and etc...

While you have the oppurtunity to examine details from many aspects of views in one subject It is very hard to do this if you care about the all matters. And having this oppurtunity will contribute the efficiency and productivity of the studies. 

By specializing in one subject one gains the confidence to carry out new researches and he/she is encoureged with new findings.  

On the other hand a close cooperation among the fields of studies is necessary to yiled fruitful results. Since some subjects are interrelated  and have very close ties with eachother we need to achive this cooperation in order to have more advanced results.

Finally I beleive it is better to have an expertise in one subject. This is not a choice but an obligatory situation in today's world. Morover some sort of efficient mechanisms must be promoted to establish connections among the related subjects.     
  

  
","In my sense it is better to specialize in one specific subject in a globalised renovative and inventive world namely in today's world as an exper in a specific subject. Twentieth and these centuries have been the leading centuries in technological enhancement and progress. so much information is being circulated so fast that sometimes it is very difficult to follow up on the developments. In this environment it is more useful and efficient for a person to specialise in a specific topic and improve himself in this field. To me we have to specialize since this is the only way to go in this century. Just giving an example you can not go to a doctor specialised in heart illnesses for a headache you are suffering. The very broad range of fields in medicine requires doctors to specialize in one of those fields. We can consider this requirement for all of the other sciences namely social sciences mathsetc. .. While you have the opportunity to examine details from many aspects of views in one subject It is very hard to do this if you care about all matters. And having this opportunity will contribute to the efficiency and productivity of the studies. By specializing in one subject one gains the confidence to carry out new research and he/she is encouraged with new findings. On the other hand, close cooperation among the fields of studies is necessary to fruitful results. Since some subjects are interrelated and have very close ties with eachother we need to achieve this cooperation in order to have more advanced results. Finally I believe it is better to have an expertise in one subject. This is not a choice but an obligatory situation in today's world. Moreover some sort of efficient mechanisms must be promoted to establish connections between the related subjects. "

In my opinion, I agree the fact that young people nowadays so not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints.
First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them don't have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually concern about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about that what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and attractive in their appearances. There are so many accractive things to worth them to pay attention to. 
Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have few contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understandings with their communites. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly.
Fianlly, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships.

They don't want to give more. Most young people want to be lead a luxirous life and pursue for the dreams what they really want to in the future. They become more selfish.       
To sum up, given the reasons above discussion, I agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Because they are educated more selfish, most of them concerned themselves more than others. In addition, they prefer to the other noticeable things to make their life more exciting and interesting.

Some thinks that doing what they already know how to do well is better in contrary to those think that trying new things and takeing risks is more important to be successful. In my point of view, I personally agree the second idea. These are my following reeasons.

First of all,  taking risks is important to struggle with the difficult life conditions. For example, some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging, cycling. Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them;however, if people want to enjoy the life more and be more healtier, they should try new and risky sports. It shouldn't be afraid of them to do risky sports.

In addition to this, taking risks is a fundemental issue because of the experience the life more deeply. For instance, i always do the most difficult tests first at school. Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it. Although it means taking risks, i prefer to do it and anytime i didn't face with a bad situation.Therefore, it is really beneficial.

The last but not least,  taking risks is also important to see which can we do the best.For example, a footballer prefer to run not to long in the exercises. While he is doing that he doesn't know if he run very long distances, after that he can be better in his job.Thats why it is important.

1357482.txt,P4,JPN,medium,"   I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are.
   First, we always choose same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys a same snack. One day, I asked him about,""Why do you choose same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watched this snack's commercial at television, then I think that this snack is tastes good, so I always chose this one."" I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he influenced by television commercial, so he always chooses same snack.
    Second, we always belive the content of commercial. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food.
My fater asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy an expensive natural food?"" My sister answered that,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food."" However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there are a lot of value in her natural food, but it was as same as normal food. She influensed by the advertisement that included her book.
   Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercial,  radio commercial, magazine, book, newspaper, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show a correct information. The meaning of advertisement is to sell a lot of goods, so when we buy any good, we should reserch a lot of information, and we should ask opinion to family or friends. If we can collect a lot of information, we can choose correct good. I think that correct information is more important than influence by advertisement.Before we chose good, we should remember this thing.

264742.txt,P1,HIN,medium,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than to specialize in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely posess knowledge about various subjects but its  better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. 

Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove  skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up  Information Technology as specialized course during college as its expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perfom during his job. 

Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an oppurtunity/liberty  to decide the field they are most interested in studying and making a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administative services. I have even come accross few parents who give their children the liberty to choose they career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects. 

In conclusion, I would like to express disagreement for a person to possess broad knowledge of many academic subjects. After all if a person is ""jack of all trades, master of none""  he would not be able to work in this competitive world which exists today.

130222.txt,P3,ZHO,medium,"      Nowadays more and more young people don't care about their livning communities. They spend a lot of time on their study works in school or cream school. Even they have free time they may use it on their entainment activities, like go shoping with friends or family. Although there still some young people have pay some attention to their communities, it is my believe that they don't give enough time to help their communities.

    The first reason that caused the young people can't devote more time to their communities is that the high competitive pressure in the education system. Their parents wish their child can get a good grades in different subjects that caused them need to attend different courses. Even ater the day time from the school, they need to take some courses in the cram school to do some supplements. In addition, while they have free time after the hard work in their study. They usually use it to do some entainments, like see the movie or sing the song in the KTV with their classmates or friends. Furthermore, due the the busy work of their parents that cause the fathers and mothers didn't have much time to edcuate their kids, not to metion to teach their kids to do something helpful to their communities.

So from point of veiw, if we want to encourage the young people to do more in our communities, we need to take more effort on our education. Firstly, we need to encourage the parents to take their children to attend some activity in our community. Let these young people to know more their society. Then in the school, we need to allocate more time to teach the importance of helping communities, not just ask the student to focus on their study.

Through these improvement, I believe the young people will pay more time in their community than before. And the problems in the community will reduce and whole socity will become more stronger.

600651.txt,P3,ITA,medium,"    Some people believe that they must not help other people if the actions do not provide any benefit to themselves. Others, like me, believe that few hours every week must be used to help the communities. I would support my view with a couple of reasons.
    First of all, living in Italy, I know that most of the young people in my country works or studies not more than eight hours a day. Other people, like Chinese, work for at least 12 hours a day and they have not time to do other activities after they have finished studying or working. Conversely, italians could spend a lot of hours doing social activities that could help the community. For example, someone studying in the university located in the centre of Rome goes back home at 5 p.m. . Probably, he could remain in the city and dedicate his time to disabled people helping them to come back home easily, for example helping them to get into the buses or to take the subway. Unfortunately, italian guys prefer to watch soccer matches on television or go to the restaurant with friends.
    Second, in my opinion governments should think a law regarding young people activities in social communities. My view is that few people would do helpful social activities without a strong committment from our state. In the case of Italy, there is not a law regulating actions that young people can, or must, do in order to help the community. Probably a good law should oblige young people that are not still working to spend on this activities at least 2 hours a week. In this manner, the state would help both the community and the young people, taking them far from  television or playstation. 
    In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement. In my opinion, every person that has some free time during the day should spend few hours in social activities in order to give benefits to his community.

First, younger people have very less responsibilties in their life when you compare to that of a older guy.A old man usually keep thinking about his family and his responsibilities.He got to sacrifice many of his pleasures for the sake of his duties.On the other hand most of the young guys main aim would be to enjoy the life whether its college or job as they got someone who cares for them.

Second, not all things are possible for a older guy as he doesnot have the energy or capability.Energy is innate in an younger one.Considering an example in which both the younger and older goes on an expedition probably a mountain.The later could not do it alone as he does not have the potence in him.Although he might have a good knowledge about the place,he is not physically suitable.

Finally there scope of enjoyment for the older is narrowed.The narrowing is due to society and physical capability.Normally a oldman cannot go around adventorous trips or play different kind of games especially outdoors.Society brings a lot of change in the older people especiallty their thoughts,their character and their behaviour.For example,he cannot flirt around with a girl as he had a wife,he cannot go on a risky job as he got many people dependent on him.Coming to the younger people the scope is as broad as their imagination.They can enjoy thier life in the way they wish to.

I hereby conclude confidently that young people do enjoy life mre than the older people do.

Nextly will be to get a better grades because we have many academic subjects in our heads normatter how many subjects in a day we will be able to know  must of the needs in the topic. And than at the end of the year or tearm when the grades come out you will be proud of your ownself. Some more students will come to you and ask you the question that their don't understand so you can be their teacher to teach them what ever thing their need and they will look up on you 
My last point will be the teachers, sometimes you can find the teacher struggling on some questions and you can prom them by telling them some clues so they will know what to do after all. you might be able to be their top students as will. So whenever they need help with their work you can teach them. They  might give you a better effect and grade.
My conclusion is that we surely better to have a board knowledge and many academic subjects in the brain than haveing blank in the head when you are doing some kind of test. 
","It will be better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects because after you have all those academic subjects in your brain cells you won't have to worry about any problems with class work. My first point of view will be that if we have all that knowledge in the brain we can be much more cleverer and we won't have to ask our classmates about the problems that we have. We can solve it ourselves. It will be better to do it yourself than ask others because it will be quite embarrassing.

1738687.txt,P4,JPN,medium,"I think the most advertisements are made to look the products much better than they really are. They make the ad or TV commercials intensionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain poing of products. 
Typical example is, I think, an advertisements of car. One commercial that I felt like I missed the poing was the one; a man at the groccary casher looks at what he was going to buy and what the other man is going to. He got vegitables and a pack of big in Tofu in his cart and the other man has huge bulk of beef. After that he rushes into a car dealere and buys a big car. An impression that I had from this TV commercial  is,  ""Get a big car, get your dignity."" But the car eats gas like a monster. 
In these days, especiall after the midle-east crisis, the gas efficiency is one of the most important elements when you choose which car you perchase.  More people concern about efficiency much more they used to before. 
I believe that the car company ought to forcus on what the era require them to make and respond what poeple need. 
The ad doesn't show anything like that but encourage people to reverse the flow of the current. 
We, comsumers need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertisement.

And I recon these things are all about money at the begining and human effect comes next. I mean if you don't have enough money to do these things then you may not experience their pleasure so you can't be satisfied. Another point is the human effect which relates the issue most and it means wish or want of a person to be happy in his or her life. For example if you have money and wish to go to outside for a dinner, then it is so simple for you to do this. Otherwise if you have money but no wish or vice verse  then you can not have a good night so I think lifestyle does not depent on age. In adition to these two major points, I must state that  your social enviroment has also good or bad effects on your life. For example you may live in a place where there is no movie therefore you can not go to a movie even if you have maney and wish.

   Talking about the present scenario where success has become every man's need,a person who is just having a knowledge on one subject cannot climb the stairs of a ladder that could lead him to a successfull path. Its not bad to be focussed but not saluburious in the current era.Focussing on one subject can have many diverse effects.Having knowledge on one subject the job areas to which the person can apply will be restricted.He will be able to apply for some of the jobs only,that could lead to more of frustration and more of tension as he will not be able to apply for jobs that may be could lead to fulfill his major dream.
    The present man should try to have as many knowledge on each and every subject as he can.As in big industries its the sphere of knowledge that matters and not the perfection on one subject.And once you have got the platform then success is just few steps ahead.Taking examples from our outside world as that of Miss Aishwarya Rai,former Miss World and a successful bollywood actress.It was not just her beauty that carried her through such a tough path but her intelligence.She became Miss World ,which is not an easy job, and then got an easy way to enter the film industry.So as she was perfect in fields including intelligence and beauty, she could reach the doors of success early as compared to the ones who entered the industry at the same time.

This is the main difference i think.

In fact a young person knows that he has a whole life to live. He enjoy living looking at the future, while an old man lives looking at what he has lived in the past. 
A young person has the enjoy to create his future catching each single sensation coming from the outside (the world). A baby is usued to enjoy everything because everything is new; a very old person may feels like he has no more reason to live, and so his life becomes something like ""Waiting for Godot"", waiting for something trying to find some distraction to spend life.

The preoccupation of healty is another main attitude that contribuites to make old people to life in fear.

We can also be a teacher. We can teach French and English for example.

Moreover, not only to help people but for also for us. We can proove to ourself that we can learn different subjects, we can understand them, and finally be good at them. It can be seen as a way to be proud of ourself and having the feeling to be part of the society, as far as we are concerned by many points.

However, having a broad knowledge means studying and also learning  a lot, so we can be tired because of it, and not share time with his friends, his family, going to the cinema. It looks like having no fun, and to considering it that way, life can be boring.

We can also be teachers. We can teach French and English for example. Moreover, it is not only to help people but also for us. We can prove to ourselves that we can learn different subjects, we can understand them, and finally be good at them. It can be seen as a way to be proud of ourselves and have the feeling of being part of society, as far as we are concerned by many points. However, having broad knowledge means studying and also learning a lot, so we can be tired because of it, and not share time with our friends, our family, going to the cinema. It looks like having no fun, and to consider it that way, life can be boring. To conclude, I have tried to explain the reasons why having broad knowledge can be useful (help, proud) but we must consider that this point of view can be limited. "
1200422.txt,P4,ARA,medium,"Products that a company make must look in front of the customer unique and useful through advetisements. Therefore i must agree with this statement: most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are.

Let us take a simple example, chocoate bars. I am sure that u have seen an advertisment for one. Dont you notice the expressions on the face of an actor who eats that chocolate bar? If i ate that bar i dont think the expression on the face of the actor will come to my face simply from the taste of it. This example is only to clarify the exaguration in advertisements.

If i own a company i would rather make my products look the best and most useful for the customer therefore other owners will also do the same exact thing. I am not encouraging the companies to exceed reality but to use imagination instead of exaguration.since in nowdays advertisments take more time than our daily watched progarms, so i think the best way to attract to consumer is by entertaining advertiesments rather than fake ones.

I think that it is the owners right to show his products in the way they want and also it is the right of the customer to buy the products that suits him.In the monopaly of a bussiness however, the company could be punished to not clearly showing the reality of the product and in that case, instead of the company gainning profits it could close down.

At the end i want to state a plain idea that i mentioned before which is to use creative advertisements rather than false ones.And that i am in total agreement with this statment mentioned above.

112005.txt,P7,TEL,medium,"I agree with the statement mentioned that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or idea that where and how to use in practical.
For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem.This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination.They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given.So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve the any problems based on that concept.

For every problem there will be a concept behind to solve it.
Another example as, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter.In that there is a chapter calle ""GRAVITATION"".In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation.Due to gravity whatever the things thrown in the air from earth's surface it will fall on the earth again because of gravitational pull of the earth.If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth's surface,then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason.Due to this type of learning none of the students will not become good engineers or any other professionals.Because lack of concepts and practical knowledge.

Even if we take a civil engineer student who don't know how to build the building and where to build then definitely the building will be collapse.

That is why, it is important for the students to learn concepts and understand the ideas rather than to learn facts.

Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship among the communites in Tokyo. So our school establishs new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. 

I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over the 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about the IT products such as cellular and personal computer. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular, old people do not use them in general.  Modern life is sastained by the Infomation Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular can are used as railroad ticket, wallet and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them.If old people do not use them, they can not catch up the social change. So we teach how to use them in community center.  

Morevoer, we can learned about Japanese culture and custom from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not chance that  we learned about  old Jpanaese culture. For instance, I was learned about the drinking tea which is  one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. 
I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has been increased rapidley, they suffer from solitaly. But I think that  young people make them active. And it is advantage that young people learn about  customs. These activites improve community problem.

Next, I attend to the community`s activity such as  the cleaing the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago.  To improve its condition, I attend this activity. 

In conclusion, Japanese young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. Aforemationed activities improve not only Jpanaese society  but also the knowledge of young Japanese.

	Many people in the world try to enjoy their life.  However some people think older people can not enjoy life, but that is just a stereotype. Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies.

	Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do such as, knitting, watch movie, plant their own gardens.Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to flowershop and looking for the special flower seeds.And when he back to home, he sprayed the water the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it.

	
	The second reason is not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots of her friends.In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the travelling was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend a time with their friends and enjoy the time with them.

	Forthose reasons, old people can enjoy thier life with their friends and hobbies. Especially my grandfather and grand mother, they really love their life. If someone says old people live their life just boring and nothing special, that is not true, they can live their life what they like to do and spend the time who they wants.If they find their hobbies and friends, they would live their life better than younger people.

First of all, the most important reson is that heavy burden of their studying. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of  exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it wasts time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communties, they will lack of time to prepare their tests. Futhermore, if they could not study in famous universities, they would not have a bright futhure even if they take part in some communities.
Second, young people have various kinds  of things need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope to independence. Many young people choose to do part-time job to earn more money and buy anything what they want.  They may feel tired  to take part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience on their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confidence in their interview because they have work experience in some companies.
Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of computer all day and play games.

      over the years the risk factor has been taken into consideration by all leading men and they take the risk into account even before they take up a buissness.but its annoying to know that these people who are mostly successful when they have taken the risk or taken a chance have been successful otherwise today we wouldnt be connected to the entire world through the internet if the risk was not taken.we wouldnt be doing so much with the computer if bill gates wouldnt have taken the risk and invested so much  in only developing computers and its softtwares.

Moreover, if some academic in many academic subjects is not interesting to people, then the environment discouages people's studying ability For example, according to the study by one of the most famous professor Dr. Kim in Republic of Korea, 68.9% of people like learing one exciting academic subject because it makes people's good studying circumstances. In this sense, I would rather that specializing in one specific subject because it strengthens people's exciting studying circumstances.
   In addition, I would rather studying the academic subject of one specific subject because future occupation needs professional knowledges. Our special occupation in the future is generally only one such as teacher, nurse and doctor. These occupations have a special technique to do their works. For instance, in my case, the computer programmer needs special knowledges such as coding Java languages, C languages and C++ language. These knowledge can aquire efficiently only in computer science academic subject. In this sense, I would rather that learning the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject.
   In conclusion, I definitely prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it intensifies people's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject.

	I think the best way to travel will depend of the motivations of your trip.  Maybe if you want to expend so time quitely to relax yourself or maybe to meditate, you will prefer travel alone without guide.  The motivations in that kind of trip is  only relax and have a good time.  Some people need these time, in this rush society where all the things pass very fast. Some poeple need space to enjoy and have time to theirselves.   For these reason I  believe if you decide have your time the best way to travel is alone.  
	But in other way is you want enjoy and take a trip for education reason you will choose go  with a group and guide.  The guide will  give direction and inform you about the places you will go. In this ocasion I think the best way to travel is in group because in the group you can share ideas, information and you can learn in social enviroment.
	Other example that ilustrate my point is this: supose two men decided make a trip for El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico).  The motivations of the first person is have a good time with friends and explore  all the forest, but hte motivation of the second person is pass a good time reading in the high of the mountain.  The first person will agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide, but the second person  will agree that the best way to travel is been alone, without guide.

1200782.txt,P7,ITA,medium,"Since I've been student for a long time, I can say that at the age when we are young students (for example High school age), we normally tend to care more to understand ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts. 
Anyhow, I have to say that, at least as far as my experience is concerned, along the student age we change our learing process, passing from giving more importance on theory to linking theory to facts.
For example when we talk about students untill high school, I believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools, family and social enviroment. At this age we don't care, for example, about political events or international affairs. This is due to the fact that certainly we are too young, we are more focused on other things such as having fun, going out,  doing some sports. What is more, we're completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts.
On the other hand, when we go to the university, and this is another step of being students, I think the things change. It happens because we're getting in another enviroment in which we weant to be well considered, we're meeting other people with who we're going to share more adult experince and last but not least we're getting more mature. As a result we can link in a more efficient way what we studied (aslo during the high school) to the real facts. For example it happens to me when I studied the concept of inflaction. When I was watching the TV news, I was really surprised to finally  understand what inflation is and what are its effects. And this is not all. We're also becoming able to link some concepts that we've learnt in the past to the real facts, and at that time you finally realize how was usefull to study that concept (that at the beginning it has been considered stupid).
So, I agree partially that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts, because it could depends if we're considering high school student (who are more focused in concept and ideas) and university students (who are beginning to link the concepts to facts).

You have the advantage to separate you from the mass of other students or applicants. Therefor zour chances are better to get a job offer from maybe a chinese company or a company that has got close connections to China. 
However, if you have just studied business with a wide range of different subjects and areas, it could become more difficult to find the right job. There are no specific positions in a company that would fit to you.

There is of course no doubt, that education is really important and  broad knowledge is always be a good basis. But concerning the job market it is probably not enough.
Especially today, it is pretty hard and exhausting to find a job in Germany. You have to offer special skills and educations to get the chance of a good job.
According to this, people should concentrate on subjects where they can provide necessary skills and which they like to do.
Normally, that is only a small and limited area of a subject, in business, for example management and not the whole subject which would also includes financing for example, a completely different area.

First of all, for  making  good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things.Doesnt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everbody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products  like they are great .Obviously they  lie to people.

But companies doesn't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for few times they will earn money more than they expected. However later on , these products lose their popularity. Because people understand that this products are not good as they hope  . People absolutely  know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as  fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time.

I think the best way  producing  products are making it  as good as company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way.

 I beleive that  people must  against these kind of products, because  we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we should against this products that they arent good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildrens won't see this kind of lies and bad products. If we against them and not to buy this kind of companies products , they will be gone.After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something.

The most important point here  that i wanna focus on is lying to people . If you lie to someone, even though you will say truth next time, they wont beleive you. The main point is not to think only ourselves . Everybody has to care about other people or even animals too. 

If do something wrong or not right , one day someone can do it back to us . We never forget this.

another reason why successful people take risks and try new things is to gain new experiences from  challanges  and that comes to them, they test thier mettle against them   and  assess themselves  whether they will be cope up with that challange or not and judge thier performance against new problems and chalanges they faced in thier life.

 more over the imporatnt lesson one can learn from trying out new things and taking risks is that gaining experince and paractical knowledge from past failures and its out comes. with this practical knowledge he gained he  will definitly have a chance to progress in his life.he also gain ample exposure to new things and new experiences.

another reason is if we do things already know how to do well we can attain perfection in that field but we are not up to the mark when we face new things and new challanges, so it is better to try new things all over our life, 

finally it can be better illustrated with  an example by considering an employee in an organization, if the employee do the things he already done, he attains perfection but when he was given a new work to do or he attains new position, definitly he wiil struggle while adapting to the new situation.

with this factors i conclude my essay

	NO,I don't agree with this statement. Because,now a days present technology is improved a lot.Peoples are introducing four wheelars with different modles and different infrastructure. Not only this four wheelar two wheelars also.Now a days buying a car became a prestige issue.So, every people going to buy a car if they had enough money. 
        
	 Most of the people in the society feel that if they have a car then only people  respect  them.Now a days there is a no person without a car those who had enough money.People now a days only using cars large in number.So if u consider the future day-to-day technology is improving a lot .So,people  are crazy about buying a car,especially recently setled people.In olden days people were craze about buying a bike when they got settled. But the present situation is not like that,people are paying more intrest on cars not bikes. 
        I want to share my one of the personal experience. Consider My uncle, working as an advocate only.All of his colleagues in the court are bought a car.So,Inoder to show his prestige issue he simply applied for a loan and he bought a car .He consider it as prestige issue.Not only my uncle people in the society are consider it as  a prestige issue.
      
	I want to share my another example,i had a friend . She is younger to me.She got  a job in software industry when i am in B.tech first  year.Before she got settled she always told me that ""i like bike very much,so when i got settled i will buy a bike"". But Two years back she bought a car . Then i asked her, sister two years back you are crazy about a bike,but now you buy a car what is the reason. Then she replied me ""ohhhh, where are u my dear now a days people are more crazy about cars not bikes,that's why i bought a car,its also a prestige issue for me"". 

	SO,what i conclude is  according to the present technology and thoughts of a person(he/she) definitely after twenty years the usage of cars will be increased a lot.

As per my view looking at present days scinario, it is better to have a lot of knowledge of many subjects. As science is in a phase of revolution and todays necessities that people should to have an interdisciplinary person.
Another point is that using multydimensonal approach to solve any problem.
Firstly, now a days it's time for revolution and renovation.
Since, time is changing and we are in 21st century, so we have rebuild many concept because todays the science has achieved so much and technology is also in very good condition. We have also to find out some answers of many questions which are not solved yet.
Therefore, we have to be gain knowledge of many subjects to improve our ideas.
Secondly, we should try to get enroll in various new and intradisciplinary subjects.
Here I want to say that at present time's need that we should try to get admisson in various new subjects and it's much better to take an Interdisciplinary subject. By studying an interdisciplinary subject, we can gain a knowledge of a variety of subjects. For example, Applied sciences can provide a vast knowledge of various subjects, which we can't get from any specialized subject. Another example may be of Bioinformatics, where we learn and read various subjects as Biology, Computersciences, Information technology, Maths, Stats, Physics and Chemistry. So that I think this type of students can work much better and can handle various types of problems.
Thirdly, multydimensinal approach can solve some critical problems.
Present time it is a very nice idea to be an multidimensonal person.
For example, in any research institute's theres a problem which involves Physics, Mathmatics and Biology, then here is a proplem that not any person knows all the things so here a person having multisubjects knowledge can do well. So that we can make a model and can solve a problem without any problem.
Therefore, I can say on the basis of these some points that it is better to have a knowledge of varivous subjects. Means jack of all tra

1844735.txt,P5,SPA,medium,"   The car is one of the most important machines the man have created. Human life have changed a lot since this machine, that at first was exclusive but that now is consider as one of the most necesaries, was invented. 
  The car has become one of the most important ways of moving around. It is used for every type of trips: long trips, where its use is less common, or short ones, that we ca not imagine doing without sitting at the wheal. New generations had become more dependents on cars than old ones.
  Nowadays the cities are not biuld for walking. The distances from one place to another are so big that noone can go walking from here to there without getting exahusted. The new type of city makes the need for cars greater: the jobs are usually allocated on the city, but the houses are placed on the suburbus. For example in the states they are areas for everything, nothing is mixed. With this what I mean is that the houses are all together, then you have the moll area, then you have the area where the office are placed etcetera.
  Some people will say that public transport could make or need for cars lighter, but the truth is that it does not work. People drive cars because they have concrete needs that they need to fullfil. For example there is never the same bus that takes you to the grocery store, the school where your kids study and your own house. It is simplily easy to drive your car wherever you need to.
  This are some of the reasons of why I belive that in twenty years ther will be more cars in use than there are today, beacause as the time goes by the need becomes greater.

908855.txt,P6,KOR,medium," About a couple of years ago, My friend and I went trip to Australia and NewZealand for 2 weeks. We went in a group of 20 people led by a korean tour guide. People in a group including us visited the same places at a time and we had a same meal everytime. I thought that it was totally ridiculous and I paid money in vain. We couldn't even enjoy things that we could have. It is not a good memory for me but a worthless exhausting trip.
 There is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, It just gets rid of my interests about the touring places. A tour guide tells us everything, and we should go places only where the tour guide leads us. There can be many things that I am going to get interested in that the tour guide is going to miss out. As far as I am concerned, I usually search some informations before I do something. In fact, I didn't know that I am supposed to go in a group. I expected that I go with my friends I found many informations about the Australia and NewZealand such as famous places, fees that I have to pay, the climates, transportations and so on.. And I prepared some plan to go and have some special meals. But it was just a dream.   
 If we go trips not in a group, but indivually, we could go places where we wanted. We could do things flexibly and don't have to take up useless time. It makes me have foods that I really wanted. There are many things to see that we need to take some time. It simply enables us to do it. Going individually could really help us enjoy the whole trip.

	First, most of the adverstisments company only wants to sell, no matter how, no matter when, but the faster the better, sometimes they exagerate the functions of a product or its qualities, to convince and presuade people to buy it.

	Second, the product will eventually work but most of the times not in the way shown in the adverstisment, lets take the case of a no-hair lost shampoo, the advertisment will show a bald man who wants his hair back, so he will use the shampoo for a few days and after minutes in the advertisment you will see a guy with long hair talking about his experience, i really do not beleive that, thats my personal opinion because they say you will se results in a short period, and yes, you will see them but not as much as they say it will.

	Third, advertisments create sometimes a non-real idea of the products, or if they do they will show you real shallow.

	In conclusion, advertisments only work for boosting up a product and convince a costumer. It is not a main purpose show what the product really is or how is it going to work or how long does it will take. They just want to convince you and persuade you to buy it.

1358958.txt,P3,FRA,medium,"I disagree with people who think that, nowadays, young people do not give enough time helping their community. 

First of all, I think it is very difficult to compare a society at different times. It is often heard that that young people were more respectuous and more polite in the past, but which past? During the last century, the society in developped counries changed radically, hence it is very difficult to compare young people now and in the begining of twentyth cenury. For example, in the Middle-Age, there were a lot of wars and young people had to help their communities fighting against people. But now, it is does not exist really. So the evolution of our socities make the comparison impossible. 

Then, I think we can see every day young people who try to help other people of the community. We can see very often young people leaving their seat in a bus to a old person or a pregnant woman. That is, obviously, something very basic, but this kind of daily behaviour is very important because it makes people feeling well and in safety. 

Moreover, I think young people today have to study longer than in the past. They have many classes, every day, except for the week end of course, and consequently they are more and more busy. Our societies, and consequenlty our communties say to young people to do some sports, to go to the cinema or to the nightclubs, for example. It causes that young people have less and less time to do something. I also think that there is a kind of new definition of community for young people: for them this word represents people around them directly, and, for example, many students prefer to have activities in the different associations of their university rather than to do something for the council for example. But it does not mean they do not give time to helping their community

As a conclusion, it is obvious that, for me, young people spend a lot of time to help the community, even though this time is not this one expected

In my oppinion i agree with the idea of understand the ideas and concepts than learn the facts and this is because in order for a student to apply what he has seen in class to real work, is better to understand the concepts and ideas so he can convert to the best for the work. 

Some of the reasons , first if a student can understand and idea he will be able to apply what he just notice (learned) in another way or situation,  like when a ""painting student"" just learned that the colors could be mixed to form some others new colors, and the profesor explained so well which types of tones can be mixed with others, and he will experiment all what he understand of this class.

But in the other hand, if the student had learn the fact that colors could be mixed, like red with blue give the result of purple, we identify that the person will have the idea and absollutly the knowlegde of every color, but he didn't understand the real meaning of the objective of the class.

The second reason is since every person can transform the informacion in diferent ways and for some people can be easy to understand new subjects in the class, like the ""history of Mexico"" all the concepts, what happened in the past, but definitly that understand it, get the main idea with their own words, will be able to remember it in the future years.

And on the contrast a person who learned the ""HISTORY"", is not a very good resource for teaching some other classmates, because is closed to explaind with their own words what they learn, as an example Its me, i can not remember the History complete, due a memorizing moment in order to learn by that time. 

So, basically it is important in any school to encourage the students to understand very good the main points of every lesson learned, so the will be able to apply this in a future with their own understanding of the concept the teacher wanted to explain.

First, traveling with a tour guide could save time. For example, in 2005 I traveld to Italy with my mother by using a tour company. My mother and I wanted to go to Italy for a long time and so we were looking forward to visiting museums and historical places. However, there are many museums and famous places in Italy. We worried about how would we do to see efficiently. We consulted with our tour guide and she gave us good advice. She changed out tour route to be able to visit efficiently, where we wanted to go. This example clearly shows that traveling with a tour guide could save time.

Second, traveling with a tour guide could learn more. When I perticipated in the tour goint to India in 2004, I were led by a Indian tour guide. We went to many temples, but I did not have much knowlege of Hindu and Muslim, Indian religions. Then, he lectured me the religion and the means of pictures and structures in the temples. Also, he answered my questions. For example, what is the most famous person in India, what is the most popular occupation among Indian women and so on. I could learn many things from the guide. The above experience demonstrates that traveling with a tour guide could learn more.

     To learn facts you have to understan the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about the world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginig.
     Every person have brains therefor, it should be used. Logic and commen sence are all maters for understanding ideas and cocepts. A person can memorize a book but that doent mean that the person understood it.
     People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newtons laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a littel bit of commen sence and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts.
      However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understandin the ideas and learning the concepts. Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying. while a person can teach something if he didnt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough.
      As I said before a person needs his brain, logic, and commen sence. Therfore understanding ideas and learning concepts are much important than learning facts.

For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in the paradise. If they do that, people, most of consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shoting the commercial in ideal place, the car company would make much of income.

This situation is not only happened in famous companies but also small, develping companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of unreality of advertisement make this situation.

well, the answer lies in the question itself, its impossible for one to learn the ideas and concepts without learning the facts about them.

for example when someone is asked not to do something , he  wants to know, why is that particular task prohibited ?, and when he is explained ""why he was asked not to do so "", he will tend  to ignore them ,than abide by them or he would try them and then learn  either through the punishments or through the factual behind it, perhaps that would help him to analise the  situation throughly and then he would act wiser the next time.

                  So, it of more  important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts or learn the facts? 
 
My answer would be ""both"" ,the student should get the oppurtunity to learn about it  from the teacher as well as learn it by doing tasks  practically , and if the issue is about things that cannot be done practicaly then he should try and find out some materials or facts about the particular issue, and then he should be allowed to prioritise and analise the facts and draw a conclusion , rather than just letting himself beleive the doubtful concepts. He should make a note and then consult the teacher or professor and get more details about it,
                        This idea not only gives the student abundant satisfaction but it also helps the student generate keen intrest in the topic  because he is constantly looking for the right answer and almost aware of the whole concept ,while he never struggled a lot emphasizing himself to learn it.

","learning begins at home, even a small thing that happens in our daily neighbourhood affects the student's learning capabilities. Will just understanding these ideas or concepts help the student? or will he have to learn the facts? well, the answer lies in the question itself, It is impossible for one to learn the ideas and concepts without learning the facts about them. for example when someone is asked not to do something , he wants to know, why that particular task is prohibited ? , and when he is explained ""why he was asked not to do so "", he will tend to ignore them , then abide by them or he would try them and then learn either through the punishments or through the factual behind it, perhaps that would help him to understand the situation more thoroughly and then he would act wiser the next time.

56222.txt,P4,ITA,medium,"In daily life there are a lot of products and some of this are not so good, but most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are! Yes, I am agree with this statement because I think that a person have to touch with his hands the product he need becase if we follow only the advertisements he can fall in a not good product. For example, if I have to buy something products the first thing is watch this prodict and analyze it because I want to know it is good or not. Is like buy a T-shirt of a famouse stilist or a not famouse stilist, all the people prefer the first one because have the name but when they buy it, they do not look the material (for example), they buy it because is made from a famous stilist. But if we research more and more in another store I think that we can find a better T-shirt with a low cost. 
Another example is a dishes soap that i call with the name 'A', the advertisement say that A can clean everithing and  your dishes will be white like the best white thing. Than a person go to buy it because the advertisement say that A do miracles, and when he wash his dishes, he observe that what the advertisement says is not true! Than, in summary I want to say that is important to think befor to do everything especially when we have to choose some product to buy, because sometime we can take a products that most advertisements make much better than thy really are and everytime this is a tipical thing for to spend a lot of money for a products that is not good. The first thing to do is think and the second is choosing the best product for its quality and for its cost.

1639412.txt,P2,TUR,medium," Many of the people in the world think that young people enjoy life more than older people do, some of the people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do. I aggre with that older people enjoy life more than young people do, because of that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time.
 Young people always have problems with their life. they never think time is very fast. they only live without scare of death. for example i and my friend always have problems . because of our promblem many of time we dont want to do any things. we often speks about  our problems. we think to go to holiday for reducing from stress. nonethless we post pone it to other summer and other summer never come so we never go to anywhere.                       
 On the other hand, older people think time is very fast. For an example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how was she be a older woman. She says that ` i fell myself as a young girl if i had a change to live life again i would travel all over the world`. she always goes cinema for to watch movies. she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she did`nt go before. moreover my grandfather is too interesting old man.he is a good tenis playe. He plays tenis every day. he takes lot of interesting photos to tell life. 
  To sum up, like my grandmother and garadfather older people lenjoyl
