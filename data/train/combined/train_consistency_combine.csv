One is simply economic; after the initial investment required to get humans out into space, there hasn't been much reason to justify further spending on what has become seen as a luxury rather than necessity.","With terrestrial problems like poverty and disease still prevalent, it's hard to use scarce resources on something perceived as non-essential when there are people suffering here on Earth.",0
330,The Boundaries of Space Exploratio,"The first human exploration of space was the moon landing in 1969. After that, humanity's focus seems to have been less about exploring than exploiting space. In fact, since the end of the Apollo program in 1972, no humans have gone beyond low Earth orbit. The International Space Station is currently the only inhabited platform outside Earth's gravity well and it took until 1998 for it to be completed; orbiting spacecraft like Hubble were launched long before that. Even now, plans for crewed missions to Mars are set decades into the future and there doesn't seem to be any hurry to fulfill them. So what happened?

With terrestrial problems like poverty and disease still prevalent, it's hard to use scarce resources on something perceived as non-essential when there are people suffering here on Earth.","Additionally, technological advances mean that we can now do quite a lot with unmanned probes and robots; why risk human lives when machines can do the job just as well.",0

450321.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts. My choice is based on two reasons. The first reason is that, if you learn facts, you have direct contact with reality. For example, at university, you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than if you follow a lesson of theory. This is a good way not only for a student, but also for a worker. In fact, if a worker has worked all of the day, he or she learns more things than if he or she follows a lesson of theory. I know my uncle's experience can be taken as an example. In fact, he has followed a course to work in a chemistry industry, but he has learnt the real way of working only when he has started to work in the chemistry industry. The second reason is that learning facts helps a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying. For example, I remember that, when I followed the course in the ""Way of Transport"", the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken of in how a naval motor is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built together.","To conclude, I don't agree with the sentence because it is not true that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts.",1

Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them.","In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures.",1

1014998.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors. But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons why I have no confidence in them, and I will explore a few primary ones here. To begin with, we can learn the ideas and concepts during studying factors. Teachers will be able to teach the student the ideas and concept by teaching a specific fact. Let's take a look at a physics class. At the very beginning , the teacher gives the class a specific problem, and asks them to solve it. The student might not be able to solve it, so the teacher could give some conceptional suggestions that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think about it again. And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept. Further more, why do we learn ideas and concepts ? For practical work, of course.","So, why don't we learn something that is more practical? Learning facts will lead us to work directly, and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theories or concepts, and this would save much more time.",1
1071263.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this opinion. I think, in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. I have some reason to think about that. First, some companies are now inventing new cars, like hybrid cars, electric cars something like that. Actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes. We are also interested in cars that are good for the environment. The car industry will change their way of selling the car to customers. Of course, I think of the customer for the environment of the earth will change in this few years. Second, I think that physical translation is not convenient in countryside. For me, I live in the country side, I can not ride on the bus or train when I want. It is different between the big cities like Tokyo and small cities. So people who live in the country side, they use their own car now. I also use my own car. The number of cars in countryside has increased more than before. But on the other hand, now gasoline is so expensive.","If this situation continues, the number of cars may decrease.",1
426980.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the given statement.

715272.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"For some people, you will succeed in your life just by taking risks. And it is right, in a certain way. In fact, our society shows admiration for these kinds of people. But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank. According to me, it is a lack of consciousness, especially when you are in charge of a family. This argument is far from being useless. When you make the choice of taking risks to succeed in your life, you must be aware of this.","To sum up, I can't help thinking that taking risks is a very good strategy.",1
1722823.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people and old people have different life styles. As far as I am concerned, young people have more methods of enjoying life than old people. In the following paragraphs, I will reason and provide examples to support my opinion. Young people are full of energy, which means that besides their studies and work, they have much more energy to have fun. Young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and havefun. At night, the dancing bars are full of young people. They dance, talk to each other and drink together. During the holidays, young people drive to the mountains or the sea shore to hunt , canoe or hike. Because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work, they cannot spend as much time as young people on holiday travel. They normally stay at home and watch the TV or chat with their old friends. Young people have more new methods to enjoy life because their brains run faster than old people. Because there is a lot of pressure from the job, young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged. Young people develop new methods everyday and then spread them all over the world. They practise new methods of entertainment and discuss them on the network. On the contrary, old people normally stick to a few kinds of entertainment for a long time and do not want to try new methods.",Old people know how to enjoy life and they have their methods of enjoying life.,1
1744381.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yong people enjoy life more than older people do. I agree with this statement. Nowadays young people enjoy themselves well compared to in the old days. Because at this present time they have so many entertaining equipments and these all are not available in the olden days. And the world is developing rapidly. At a time, young people also worked hard to achieve their goals and to realise their ambitions. They are doing hardwork and enjoy it at a time. They separate their time for working and for enjoying themselves. Now these days so many young people are working for many great companies and corporate companies,then they all work weekly for five days for company and the remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family. So young people also do hardwork but they make some schedule and follow that. Now so many young people are working for some company or worked for some institute,But these companies and institutes are built by old people. So old people work in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run those institutes and companies.",From the above two sentences i can say that old people work harder than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels.,1
1916426.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, the more the students are educated, the deeper knowledge they will have on their subject. However, some of them may have two majors. Which idea is good? In this essay, there are several reasons why I do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. First of all, everyone has got the same time. In other words, the condition to have an amount of study may be the same for everyone. If you spend all your time on a specific subject, you can improve a lot rather than the person who spends his or her time on two subjects. This is because he or she should divide the time. Let us assume that there are two students and the same time is offered: A person who only does economics and B person who does economics and politics.","Compared with A person, B person would know more about politics.",1

1624220.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Trying new things and taking risks is a good way to improve your skills and knowledge. you can have more benefits than only doing what you know. Therefore, successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Trying to do new things will give you a lot of benefits. Also, it will improve your skills which will help you in your career. Moreover, you can try new things by studying and improving your education. one person who has the privilege of not having a career or a salary as one receives a high certificate. Taking risks can also make you a successful person. You can enter new projects, which will receive a lot of money from you. But, the new projects may not receive that money. This is the risk taking.",Successful person is the only person who can enter these projects.,1
1806306.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are three reasons in my opinion which led to the situation. First, there are too many amusing activities to do. New high-tech toys and recreations are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stuck on those things. Big companies use strong advertising and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spend time on the products. Moreover, interacting with friends takes most young people's time. All of these activities occupied every minute of them. Second, education from young people's parents does not give them the idea. To live in a competitive world, children are taught to learn knowledge as much as they can and give attention to other things as little as they can. Cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around. They are told to keep their hands from things that are helpless to their grades. Due to this twisted concept, young people are not interested in community activities. Third, the media broadcasts negative examples which stop young people from taking action. People refuse to give time to helping their communities because of bad news.",A crazy person might hurt an unexperienced teenager while asking for help.,1
1009294.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In an aspect of shot time,It seems more effective to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize how much information or how many facts we learned and knew.","However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons.",1

Second, they have a longer time in the rest of their lives than older people do.","Third, older people tend to say that the younger the better.",1
1315961.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do not agree with this statement because younger and older people have different ways to enjoy life. Life is not about age whether it is a young person or an older person, but instead about the symbolism of joy is a way of enlightening and bringing happiness. Younger people might think or have the idea that they are the only ones to enjoy life, but at what cost. Older people have the treasure of wisdom among knowledge, with a conviction of lots of experience, they have the mature and most important quality, patience.","I have seen older people enjoying life more then younger people, but also, comes to a cost of good health.",1
1005053.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Everyone wants to know about the world around him or her for better understanding of different cultural back groundsand also to explore new things.

In the fast moving era everything in the world is constantly changing ,especially when it comes to time. Having a proper timetable is the most valuable key to a better life. So inorder to save my precious time i surely go on a trip with a. tour guide. If we go to a new place,its better if we have any local person who can call us to tell us about the history of that place. Mostly locals know better than the scholars who did research into that place. Because they will get all the information from their elders. Not only that the tour guide can also take visitors to different parts of the place from forests to rich green agricultural areas. In this way visitors can explore from wild animals to small beautiful local birds. Secondly, a tour guide can show more places in less time.",Anyway it may take somuch time.,1
476573.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"60% of people who work do not have time for entertainment because of their work. They can not do anything about this. So I think young people will enjoy life more because they have a lot of free time, they are healthier and they and they usually do not have children. The young people have a lot of free time, and their life will not be affected if they waste it. When I was in high school I usually did not study that much, and I always drove cars with my friends. I only study before those tests, and I usually get good grades. When we look at the health of a young man, it will be much better than an old one. In competitions we usually see young men and women win. once I ran with my father from our house to my grandfather's house.

1450186.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I disagree with the statement that successful people do not try new things and they use their previous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task. One of the examples I can remember of this is that a girl who always sat with me in my lunch period. She always worked very hard and I could see that she was a successful person and also will be in the future from what I saw of her. One day when she was doing her homework in front of me, I could not even tell what she was studying since it seemed like a difficult thing to me, she asked me if I could understand the question asked in the homework. I told her it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she can't even figure out.

54939.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the rise of capitalism as the dominant economic system around the world, advertising has emerged as one of the key elements of the economy, especially in the 20th century. Producers use advertising as a way of introducing a product to the customer, creating meanings around it, in order to distinguish their products from the other similar ones on the market, to make them compatible and attractive to their customers. There are different ways of promoting a particular product. Topday the advertisement sector has developed a variety of ways in order to promote a particular product. One of them is the evaluation of the qualities of the advertised product. The purposes of the producers for advertising a product are not mainly to demonstrate the real characteristics of their products, but rather to be able to reach more customers and as many products as possible. However, this does not mean that all the advertisements are about a distorted picture of the products that they represent, What really counts for a successful advertisement is its ability to appeal to the customers. One advertiser can create such a distinctive style and tell the truth about the product and achieve success without illusion.","Provided that the advertisement is in nature about the biased presentation of a particular product, one cannot expect that an advertisement should be reflecting the true characteristics of a product compared to the others.",1

First, the way of thinking is verifing now, so car makers should produce many kinds of cars to match the people's needs. Some people use theircars only when goingshopping, others use their cars as a kind of hobby. they like support cars, racing cars or off road cars, etc. Today, a typical family living in Japan has one car. But it is said that a typical family living in Japan will have two cars in a few years. one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother.

619171.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There is a controversial issue about whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Depending on personal experience, personality type and viewpoints of the globe , we may find that some people may hold the opinion that there will be more cars in twenty years than in today, on the other hand, some people may choose there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than in today. The choice, nevertheless, is not easy to make. However, from my point of view, I would like to believe the latter one is more reasonable. Because there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now, my arguments are listed as follows. An essential reason that can be seen by everyone is that the gas released from cars in big cities pollutes the environment around us seriously. According to a recent survey announced by the Minister of Health of China, cars' gas pollution accounts for 38. 7% of the total pollution which harms our environment. This strongly demonstrates that car pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be fewer cars used in our lives. Another reason for my inclination is that the number of cars makes the cities become overcrowded and It is very inconvenient for people to go to study , work and so on. For instance, in a big city, It usually takes one person to live on the outskirts one or even two hours to arrive at the company he/she works for in the center of the city.",So this is very convenient.,1

In my opinion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more realistic and more enjoyable especially for visiting a new place. Therefore, traveling with a group led by a tour guide will always be my choice because that will save my time and money, give me the background information about this new place, and give me the chance to meet and get to know new people in the group. First of all, since my budget is always law and fixed, traveling with a group maximizes my spending costs. Also, i will save time rather than wasting it seeing bad places or getting lost when i want to go to a good place. On the other hand, i will find time to hang out by my self on the streets because the tour time is limited during the day. Another main reason, the tour guide will be the most knowledgeable person about the history, museums, culture, and food of the people of this country. As a result, I will benefit from listening to this information and adding it to my knowledge.","Finally, most of the time i like to travel by myself, so, it will be a great chance to meet and get to know new people from all over the world and have new friends and talk about their cultures, 	In brief, by myself groub always be always my choice and i recommend recomend this way of traveling to my friends and my children in the future.",1
1550812.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement. Young people are too lazy to help people nowadays, although we sing:""stand hand in hand"" everyday in school. Young people nowadays are getting more and more selfish. We can hardly see a young person helping an old granny to cross the road nowadays, because we prefer chatting with friends beside the roads. I do not really know South African young people's behaviour, but i know young people in China very well. Of course, not all of us are selfish and unconcerned, but the majority of young people are selfish. They are everywhere, in the school, on the street and even just in our families. Unfortunately, i think that i am one of them too. i remember when i was in the schools of China. We need to do the daily cleaning everyday by ourselves, because that is and still is a part of our school duties. The class teacher divided us into several groups, and told us the date that we would be on duty. We want a nice and clear environment to study in, although we do not want to do the cleaning by ourselves. Therefore we expected other people could work harder to get the classroom clean. BUT, other people also thought that way. So, as you can imagine, we all worked not hard enough. Therefore, the next day we had an untidy, dirty classroom. People who had duty on that day might think that: They did not do the cleaning well, so why should I? Therefore, the next day we had an untidy, dirty classroom again. Then it just carried on like this, so we never had a clear classroom! That looks ridiculous, but that was exactly what happened. That is all about selfishness. Young people are just like that, pushing the duties on to others. Then the others will push them to someone else. We just cannot understand that if we help others, they will help us oneday, when we are experiencingdifficulties.","Young people nowadays DO have enough time to help their communities, but they just do not want to give it.",1

The subject like java, we can know the knowledge of java by understanding the ideas and concepts. concepts are more Important than facts. By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented java,we can't understand the features ofjava. we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts. facts can also Improve knowledge. By studying the facts like Independence we should know about the great leaders of our country ,and we should know about how they will work hard for Independence.

1627071.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although many people think that only during youth can we really enjoy life, I don't agree with this statement and i will now give some reasons to support my idea. First, i think that in recent years young people don't have any more time to spend enjoying life. The stressful course of modern life doesn't allow them to stop a minute and taste it. Indeed they have to study hard and a lot to be able to find a job. on the contrary retired people have a lot of time they could spend by making holidays or just doing what they like to do. For example since i was ten years old, i have dreamt about what i would do during my retirement time because since that age i have only studied to manage to succeed in my future job without, thus,having the time to enjoy the best year of my life.","Second, i think that even though many physical problems add gradually during life, they allow old people to do what they want.",1
1071641.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Many people in the world try to enjoy their life. However some people think older people can not enjoy life, but that is just a stereotype. Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do, such as knitting, watching movies, planting their own gardens. Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to the flowershop and looked for the special flower seeds. And when he got back home, he sprayed the water on the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it. The second reason is that not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots offriends. In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the trip was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend time with their friends and enjoy the time with them. Forthose reasons, old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. In particular my grandfather and grand mother, they really love their life. If someone says old people live their life just boring and nothing special, that is not true, they can live their life what they like to do and spend the time they want.","If they found their hobbies and friends, they would live their life better than younger people.",1
484161.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,Ideas and facts are really different things. Ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt. Because it is only an idea. But the fact is different. Facts must be done in real life. I think it is more important to learn facts than ideas.

283847.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with this. It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts. It is a more difficult thing than learning facts. First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts isn't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think most of the kids don't know which of these. Do you know why? Most parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of things. And that makes children interested. Second, the facts and concepts are more specific things. All adults think, they are difficult for children so children don't have to know about that. That is not true. The truth is the adults don't know about the facts and concepts. That's why they say about that. They don't know so the children don't have to know.",I think that's kind of stupid.,1

In life we need to enjoy every part, though it is related to money, adventure, drama etc. Elders are always frightened as they always think of the future rather than the present. But youngsters are really bothered about the future. For example when i am at school i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me, but finally they sent me with more caution.

1530737.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow. One, from my personal experience, traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by yourself. Because the travel company which the guide is affiliated with always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights. In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took. Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes.","According to the 8 years of personal travel experience, most travel accidents occur in a group traveler.",1
476573.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"60% of people who work do not have time for entertainment because of their work. They can not do anything about this. So I think young people will enjoy life more because they have a lot of free time, they are healthier and they and they usually do not have children. The young people have a lot of free time, and their life will not be affected if they waste it. When I was in high school I usually did not study that much, and I always drove cars with my friends. I only study before those tests, and I usually get good grades. When we look at the health of a young man, it will be much better than an old one. In competitions we usually see young men and women win. once I ran with my father from our house to my grandfather's house. I was the first in that race, and after arriving I even waited for him. young people usually have children and that will affect their normal life. All their time is spent on work or children.","When I see my older brother with his children, I say to my self that I do not want to have any children.",1

1657333.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It isn't difficult for me to answer this question because i have thought since i was a child the same thing. According to my own experience i'm sure that the better way to create and improve my student career and first of all my personality is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I refuse the idea that the best way is to specialize in one specific subject. I've grown up in an academic system that has always given me all the chance to learn about everything I've wanted. During those years i spent a lot of time reading about large amounts of material as scientific papers, historical ones, literary ones and much more. I think that for a person with broad knowledge it is easier to find a job, to create relationships with other people, to follow most of the television, paper, and book discussion. Moreover if you don't close any doors on your back you can always come back and start with another subject.","By the way I trust that it is also important to specialize in one specific subject, because nowadays the world of work requires more and more specializedworkers.",1

Besides it differs from young and old people. In this essay, I am going to show that young people enjoy life more than old people because of health and age differences. Young people enjoy life more than older people, since young people are more healthy than old ones. As a matter of fact, young people are vivid ;that is to say ,they are full of life ;they, indeed ,can travel long distances enjoying the beauty of the land scape without any complaint. Nevertheless, old people cannot travel such distances and they easily get tired. In addition, young people can do other activities,such as going to the disco,swimming or hiking.

Today the cars in our cities are too much:our air is dramatically polluted and this is because of the cars;there is also a lot of traffic and sometimes you take one hour to go only one side of your city. I think that today all people and governments have understood that the problem is big and important:probably in the next few years they are going to approve some policies in order to reduce the number of cars and to offer some substitutive service or to improve the ones that exist. I'm speaking about buses,for short or medium travels, and trains. I think that the government and the citizens of all the world have to cry to obtain this. I think that petrol companies and car industries that probably want the number of cars to increase in the next day can' t be heard by the government because the most important things are our wealth and quality of life. For a family of four, it is quite normal to have two or three cars today. I think this is very dangerous for our society. If there are a lot of cars the problem is first of all the pollution,that i think is drammatically important and is a necessary solution very soon. Other problems are the traffic and the parking. For all these reasons i think that there will not be fewer cars in use in the next few years because it is really dangerous for the population.",If the number of cars increased i would be very worried and i think we would have a lot of problems because of our wealth.,1

People generally always want to go to either the new place or the place which they have gone to before because they want to know in detail about that place. Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group. However, I personally prefer that when I go in a group, it must be led by the tour guide. Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups. They make some funny statements, and sometimes jokes. Sometimes, the information is real but it is conveyed in a group such a way that everybody laughs.

First of all; Having extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist in this area. it is such an important feature of making your job good. If you improve yourself really extraordinarily in a specific subject, it also brings you success and power. For instance; you are a doctor and you are really successful in your job. Everyone can know you because of your ability to achieve goals, as a result you will be a person who is unique in your area. Also this success could bring you happiness and money at the same time.

1446679.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main character, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with. therefore, he becomes furious at not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide.","This is a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when you are young.",1

We live our lives to our fullest when we are young, leaving behind the worries and the intricacies of old age. So i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energetic, with young minds fresh from college, with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out. ""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better than younger people. But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world.","The older people have minds that are worn out, by age , by time.",1

However, contrary to this opinion, I strongly believe that people who live in modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects. The reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who has a variety of knowledge. Moreover, if someone focuses only on one specific subject, he or she might be biased without balance. First of all, I strongly believe that people who are living in this period should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others. When it comes to biotechnology, people are eager to think that it has no relationship with philosophy at all. However, when I watched some SF movie, 'Island', I was deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives, so called global projects , which are reasonable and ethical.

It is true that worldwide transport communications have improved in recent years, Huge ""air traffic"" has taken place especially inthe 'nineties Furthermore, high speed trains have been created, even here in italy the government is about to create a high speed line. And there are also other modes of transport, for example ships, metros and busses. However in my opinion every man, every woman, prefers to move whenever they want and wherever they like without paying attention to reserving a ticket or arriving on time for the departure and whatever. And i am an example: I cannot imagine staying without my car, i need it for my job, i need it for my holidays and i can take it whenever i want without making a reservation and i am never late, i mean that my car is ""always waiting for me"".

They will learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future. They may even learn from what is happening in history. By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results.

The environment suffers nowadays with real and strong problems. The cars, and the industries related to them, increase the problem day by day. It is possible that in 20 years, it will not be possible to have a lot of cars. The governments limit the variety of cars that the population can use. Another reason would be the improvement in public transport. If people have a guide about these services, more and more people use them, and fewer cars will be in the streets. The ecological movement, many people, back to nature, and encourage the use of bicycles, walk. they promote health habits, introducing other ways for moving in the cities, for example. and at the same time, reduce the pollution. When I mentioned the city where you will live in 20 years, and the directions which the government will take.

However, in the future that is portrayed as more speedy and comfortable than nowadays in some movies, we may discard our cars and the cars will be just a huge waste of time. There are some reasons to explain this opinion. These days are changing and developing faster than in thepast. Some people have already visited out of earth, and lots of satellites are being thrown on the earth. Instead of using cars, they will move away by their personal flying like a plane or themselves. From the past, many people have wanted to fly to the sky and they finally made an airplane. The more wishes make more developments. Airplane was not our destination, therefore a lot of scientists and dreamers are making the new technologies and fantastic reality. Secondly, the future will be a robot world. We always aspire to more comfortable things and have already made some features to work instead of us. There are many kinds of robot like a working in a kitchen or playing with achild, There is even a dancing robot. Therefore, most of the lighter productive work in householding or delivery will be done by robots'.

549479.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"In our western society, where the individual plays a central role, the community appears to be less and less important, although There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist. Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community. External factors explain that. One of them is education. when raising their children, a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion. In this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others.","They are self absorbed and selfish, thinking about their own comfort.",1

One of the problems is using your own car, using public transport. I agree with the statement because i think that in a few years there willn't be as many cars as now because other comfortable and faster ways of transport will be used, as for example the plane. its at this moment one of the best ways of transport or another possibility is using cars that work with solar energy or with water containing with the environment.

572315.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It's a very interesting topic to write on. Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price.","He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price.",1
715539.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I personally agree with this statement. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy, it is true. But let me tell you this; Albert Einstein has a quote: ""Knowledge is power. ""which is completely true. Think of Biology without Chemistry; Chemistry without Physics; Physics without Geometry: Geometry without Maths and so on. A chemist cannot explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without Physics, can he? Or a Physics master cannot measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lights it, can he? Another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago. Take Pascal as an example. He has a lot of proven theories in Maths  and Physics. Isn't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored in and made himself known in? The answers to these questions I pointed out are simple and true: The laws of nature, the languages spoken, people and all the others that we know of are in only one place: here on earth. No one can prove that the facts about it aren't linked to one another. The links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end, you will end up finding yourself at the other.","So, learning Physics, learning Chemistry, learning Literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about.",1

People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping.

935619.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The question has been asked whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for them to learn facts. In my opinion, understanding is definitely more important because it gives the students a chance to explore, a chance to be creative and an unforgettable result. Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topic allows students to go through the investing process. For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literature and find out for themselves that certain techniques add to the perfection of writing. Understanding how they work would give students a better lesson. Getting the concepts and ideas also provides students with a chance to be creative, especially when dealing with are. What kind of art class would it be without studio work? Students should be offered to get creative with colours, textures, moods and all sorts of things. Who cares if they fail once in a while? New creations found in the process of real understanding. Years after years, it is not the definition that students remember, but the unforgettable experience that they learned. Giving out the facts does not provide students with a lot of thoughts of their own. By understanding the ideas and concepts, students gained the ability to conclude the facts themselves. Even if they forget about the facts, they will be able to ""reproduce"" them.",Facts are the devil that limited imagination and understanding.,1

So ,we can expect a development in technology to provide more and more cars which will have very good mileage and will be comfortable with seats and their pick-ups,instead of a decline in their numbers in the next twenty years. Say for example,there were old fashioned maruti cars (maruti 800,maruti van) and ambassador cars in the 1980s but with the recent development in the technology of cars (like the maruti suzuki swift,scorpio,TATA indica), it has improved the vehicles capability very efficiently.",That is accepted by more individuals that fewer and fewer cars will be seen on the roads in the next twenty years.,1

But I think this is not the majority of successful people. I think that the personality of them is usually another one, which is my first point against the statement. It is always easier to do what people accept somebody to do and to use old methods to become a successful person. It might be sad, but it is rather likely to become successful by using old ""tricks"", your family background or connections. So I think the personality of most successful people is rather one, which uses the old ways, than one, which tries new ways. We only sometimes think that the opposite is true, because people, who were successful at making a new invention for example are more important for other people and for us. So we know them better.","And when a successful businessman tries for example a new trading practice, he has a better chance to make good money, because he already has a full background.",1

Firstly, older people have less time to consider and have already experienced many things that they can enjoy their lives. Young people are literally 'young', so they have lots of time to think about their lives. Also they have many more opportunities to learn and try what they want than order people.

For example, we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on TV. However, they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences. But every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently from others, because they need to grab people's eyes. And it will be connected right away with their selling.","Also, the advertisements have to show only good points to people instead of short points.",1
18690.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows.","The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject.",1
1982981.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In the above paragraph author states that successful people take more resources rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings. so it was flying in the air.",The Wrights brothers are different and take more risks to implement an aeroplane.,1
525628.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"From my point of view, I see that most commercials make goods more attractive and better than they really are. And I found that from my experience and from what I heard from my relatives and friends. Although advertisements sometimes are necessary, there are still a lot of deceiving and misleading things to customers. Also for me is a waste oftime seeing , hearingand reading advertisements. From my own experience I saw an advertisement on the TV about a medicine that would relieve the pain in feet and it was very attractive, so I called for it and after using it for a long time nothing changed. And I heard a lot of stories from my friends and relatives and the same things happened occasionally to them in other stuff that they bought. I know it is sometimes there are advantages from commercials, they will expose as to the new and developed technology, materials and a lot of things. But still there are other ways to know about these things from other sources like departmental research and from the experience of others. I believe commercials were a lot of my time a lot for a lot of reasons, it takes time from me when viewing programs on TV, like news, shows, sports and almost every thing. And commercials also on radio, newspapers, magazines and everywhere. All that is a real waste of time. So I am sure of the fact that advertisements mask the fact of the product and make it much better than it is.","I realize they are not for me those commercials, they make profits for me, so I don't agree with the above statement.",1
1137116.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. From my point of view there are a lot of things that make me feel like agreeing with this statement. For example younger people are usually not that settled or depending on other people , which makes you enjoy life more and live freely. In younger years one doesn't think that much about the difficulties of life that may appear later on, such as illnesses or financial security problems. Furthermore one usually goes to college or university in younger years where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway, apart from some learning times. So yes, I would say that the circumstances in your younger years make it often easier to really enjoy life than in older years. But on the other hand I think- and I can only think about it because I am in my younger years at the moment - older people as well have their very own way of enjoying life. Surely they'll do it in a different way because it's not all about parties and having fun, but with a life-experience I am sure one can enjoy life at a different level.","Looking back on what life offered for you, everything you've already been able to enjoy and all the goods and bads you've gone through I think one can enjoy life as much as young people.",0
114142.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science.","So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels.",0
115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it, I learnt several new rules about sport, so it encourages me to play it. The other example is about risky. I took a PhD in education for two years in my country. I want to change my education place even if it has many risks. These are spending alot of money, passing the toefl exam, and completing a new phd education in theUS. They didn't know how much money I spent before. I also didn't know Whether or not I would pass the toelf an complete new education.

A young person has to go to college or university, maybe he has to work if he wants to pay for his studies or other activities.","The free time is not a lot, so when a student is free, he usually goes out with his friends and to think about enjoying activities like going to a disco or listening to music.",0

987670.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I like to travel with my father more than by myself. I always travel in summer with my family. my father, mother, and younger sister usually go to different countries each year. Traveling with my father is much better for us because, he is the tour guide. First of all, travelling with a tour guide will make the trip short and easy, since the tour guide has experience in his place. He will make my vacation more enjoyable. The second reason is that, the tour guide will choose a good place for me better than I do. One time when I went to a new city I asked for a good place to go and how I could go there. At this point I lost the way. So it saves time going with a tour guide who will take me there in a short time. and i do not need to think of time.","Finally, first think I could teach my son about travelling is to find a good tour guide.",0
1646354.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion this statement is true. I think this is because young people are at the beginning of their lives and not in the middle or at the end of it. You can recognise it if you start a new job. Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or months you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting.","Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people.",0
905111.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The statement affirms that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies. On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them. The second compromise would be with the environment, trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but, of course, trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to pollution problems But on the other hand , we can also view the coin by the other face. Even if technology can be improved during the next twenty years, it will be very difficult for normal people to achieve all the advances. In that case, in the non-developed countries and maybe in many developing countries, cars could keep their own place as the main means of transport. It is not too difficult to think about the implementation of the changes in the case of Africa, the poorest continent of the world. Even in Europe could not be possible to erase or to decrease the number of cars in the next twenty years.","There are many countries with problems in that particular area that have been trying to solve them, such as Italy, Spain and France.",0
625750.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I neither agree, nor disagree with that statement. I think actually both are important. Let me give a personal story that helped me to draw a conclusion to this question. The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of facts -knowledge and who in fact do not read the newspapers"". Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact do not exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view. For example the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was often called a big actor, a pretender. A lot of people were convinced, that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programmes from his party or important political decisions. And in fact, I often thought similarly- until I met him one day.",It was a rainy sunday and some friends of mine and I were walking through the bars of Berlin.,0
1187884.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think that those people that try new things and take risks have more success than those that only do what they already know how to do well. One of the many reasons is that people try new things in their lives because they are looking at how to be altruist and how to be successful. For instance, if I want to be a competitive person sending cars, I need to have many ideas in order to create new models and new types, more strongs, more sures, cheaper and nicer.","I have to try many risks during the elaboration of these cars, I have to risk a lot of money on employers that they be more prepared and I must give them all the necessary resources that the government's law requires.",0
1624635.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I disagree with what the statement says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I have three different points of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually. First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan anything because the tour guide knows everything about what to do or where to go. It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group. When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended. I am sure a tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat, but you have no choice but to eat something else. Even for the food, I want to research what is the most popular food in that country and I will figure out whether I can eat this food or not.","If not, of course I will look for another place to go.",0

1114004.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you. The main point is not to think only about ourselves.",Everybody has to care about other people or even animals too.,0

1854040.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with what the article says. Some people think understanding ideas and concepts is important for students, and some people think learning facts is important for students. However, from the fact of national surveys and my own experience, I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students. First off, I agree with the article because a national survey says some countries which teach ideas and concepts to students in math, and history class usually have ranked in high educated countries in the world. According to the article, in some countries, such as Greenland and Hongkong, which teach students ideas and concepts, adults usually have great insight and memory about what they studied when they were in high schools. However, some countries, which tend to teach students just facts, adults usually don't remember what they studied when they were in high schools. Second, I agree with what the article says because if people study just facts, they can't apply what they studied in daily life.",People are studying to make them knowledgeable.,0
253215.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"During life there are different periods and ages which each of them improve wider differences. The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children. Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study. They are not afraid of troublesome things they feel that they can manage the whole world. They have not always been accepted in society for being problematic and for driving crazy at their parents.",They are noisy people.,0
1830076.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I guess a lot of people had the same problem: You are reading an article about an impressive building (like the Pyramids) and you do not understand how it was built and how hot it was able to resist all the time. In case you understand the idea or concept of the building, you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings. In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind. In this essay I want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas. Firstly, you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea. In case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim. Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea. Secondly, you are able to improve the concept. If you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable.",Just think of the Eiffel Tower which had for the first time an iron staircase.,0

1067059.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the statement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than going for many. Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail. One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"". So above is cancer biology jargon saying that i am not able to understand how this can be modulated in a single step. Now check example and evaluate any person or rather an untellectual on the basis thathow can he or she have command of Many subjects? when a person is not able to get a command on a single topic of his choice.",Also refining your knowledge could leave you with very nice career options as well because you can never be a lecturer of Physics and Bilology simultaneously.,0

For example , he can read a bout his area where he is living a bout his countery. Also, he can read a bout the earth and how it was and how it became now.

173637.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only do what they already know. I have specific reasons for my opinion. Which mainly support the idea of success and development. The first and most important reason is, that I strongly connect success with challenge. In order to have success I need to have a challenge. You can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate. He does this every day, without any change. Therefore he has no challenge, because he has done this several times and knows what to do. Without the challenge he can not show success and willn't be recognized by anyone. The second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful. Everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular, new or difficult. In order to do new and difficult things, I need to know my capabilities. These capabilities will need training. Hence if I do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities, I have less possibilities to choose from. Therefore I am limited in the things I can solve. In contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which lead to beingmore successful. The third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful. For example your boss will test you before he promotes you. He will give you things to do that are new to you. For that you will have to take risks to solve these problems. Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful.",I had this often in my personal career.,0

He thanked me and changed his teaching methods. I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts. My reasons are listed below. First of all, understanding ideas helps students to expand their knowledge. If the student gets only the facts without understanding, he will forget this fact fast with any useful. A human has a brain to think and understand facts not just to learn them. Moreover, we must give the student a chance to reach the creative level. Using the brain and understanding ideas, the student is eager to create something new. If he understood how TV was invented, he would think about inventing something new.

I think that today all people and governments have understood that the problem is big and important:probably in the next few years they are going to approve some policies in order to reduce the number of cars and to offer some substitutive service or to improve the ones that exist. I'm speaking about buses,for short or medium travels, and trains. I think that the government and the citizens of all the world have to cry to obtain this. I think that petrol companies and car industries that probably want the number of cars to increase in the next day can' t be heard by the government because the most important things are our wealth and quality of life.

Although it is true that having broad knowledge can help people with various problems, as far as I am concerned, I conceive that specializing in one specific subject is more preferable to having broad knowledge in our life. I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea. The first reason is that because society will change more complicated, the demand for specialized knowledge or skills will increase. In fact, in ancient times, people had to do everything well to survive, but now people don't need to be capable of everything. For example, a famous baseball star can earn enormous amounts of money only because of his abilities at throwing balls fast. The second reason is that in modern society people cannot obtain broad knowledge of many specific subjects.

Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities, but it's not very often. I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time on their communities is the school rules. In high school and college they have a kind of rule -like homework- that a student has to help his or her community at list 10 hoursper year. We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. The second reason is that commissars are in need of helpers.

Of course, it depends on what is your field of study. For this reason I would say that I disagree with this statement. For example if you are studyinghistory, it is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of course this is also a very important knowledge that is required ofyou, as a historian , to have. It is really very important, infact a student is studying for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what you are studying but I can't say that this is more important than learning facts, because without knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something. I'm thinking about when I was studying mathematics : for me and also because the teacher was very important that we, as students, understood the ideas and concepts behind an algebraic formulation, but of course you need to know very well also the formulation itself. An other reason why I disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text books, you can't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you don't remember the facts: I'm thinking at some friends of me that they study something and after a few hours you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink, except'm the main ideas. On the other hand, I think that is important in the future, I mean after 10 or more years after your studies, to remember the main ideas and concepts; and it is quite impossible to remember all the learned facts.","At the same time, I don't want to say that I disagree with this statement but it depends a lot on which is your field of study and in which time protection you are looking for.",0

1148903.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The real cliche advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yogurt in a terrific place such as a nice dessert island. Indeed very often the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it is actually. This is really true when we talk about advertisements for goods such as food, cars, clothes. However it is not really the product that is shown to be much better than it is but rather what is around the product. Apparently you always need a cute girl, a handsome guy or a vast shiny house to sell a sausage or a. Tshirt. So it is more the stuff unconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is. Nevertheless in some cases the product is not shown as better than it is. In particular when it is an advertisement not on goods but on services. For example the advertisements are sensibilising on security on the road, or the ad concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances. In those cases the advertisement is more serious and there are fewerlies. All things considered I agree that very often the y, but it is not the least surprising and ; most people are aware of it. The goal is to create a need and to increase the sales. In a nutshell i would say that advertising is trying to make products seem much better than in reality but it is oftentimes true for goods and less for services.",But so ; eti ;.,0
505064.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First,it is very dangerous if one travels alone. When we travel to a new place,we do not know a lot about it. We will have plenty of problems. For example ,we may get lost in the new place;we may not find the right place to have meals and sleep after the whole tiring day. The first day of our trip will be full of finding ,boring and tired. Also,because if we travelled in a group,we could make a lot of new friends. I like to be with other people. It will not make me feel frightened and alone. When one of us is in trouble during the trip,the others will help him,we stay together like a big family. Sometimes after an interesting trip,someone could find his true love. Finally, our travel will become more interesting if we travel in a group led by a tour guide. The tour guide knows a lot of facts about the place which we are travelling to. He will tell us the history of the great interest when we see it.","On the last National Day, I had a short holiday in HangZhou, I traveled alone without a tour guide.",0
1165565.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"The answer to this statement depends on personal life experience and different cultural background. Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. However, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone rather than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conspicuous aspects as follows. The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guides lead you to and have no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get access to the local people' s life and culture. Through talking and living with them, you can have different cultures and perspectives on life. That will only present you with a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world. there is another reason deserving some words here.",Travelling in a group led by a tutor is a waste of money in some conditions.,0

1134094.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2.","5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year.",0

Companies and goods sellers should talk and describe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising them in a proper and honest way are mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods.

Another way of fair advertising activities, is highlighting the efforts that were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection.

1142118.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In many situations, as human beings, people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occur once in a while. Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step to leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into a --- normal person. From not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life. To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But, when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists? This is because of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus, finally he got the Nobel prize for his achievements. Not only, will he be remembered but his work of investment and achievement on the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of society. Further more, a famous French writer called ""Silva Plyth"" is famous for the poems that she wrote, the sadness and emotions through her poems; by reading her poems, emotions and a sense of sadness would soon arise. She is not any different from any other poet but, the only aspect which is different would make her so famous, is the fact that her uses of metaphor and the descriptions of surroundings are known to be so precise and carry a sense of shady cloud through reading her work. This, made her work still popular and is now what many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style.","Lastly, Not only are people that are in the academic area famous but also, one of the most famous people who most people would know is, "" The Great Michael Jordan"" he is known for his basketball skills.",0

1781285.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"At the beginning of the 19th century, the first advertisement appeared in public life. In fact,certain goods are meant to be described as much better than they really are. However, in my personal opinion, I believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the AD makers are over promoting their goods. First of all, human beings are animals that are full of desires. We want ourselves to be respected and popular among others, so we are usually willing to pay to help us achieve that goal. For example, most of us use shampoo to wash our hair everyday, and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner. Yet, is that true? Is there any scientific data ever proving that shampoo can clean up our hair? Look at the TV shows, magazines and the internet again, there are still a lot of six - year - old women who make themselves more charming by using certain brands of shampoos. As soon as we believe those advertisements, and are persuaded by them, we will go straight to spend money on buying their goods. And most of the time without even a reason. Also, if you pass by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge AD of a sports star wearing a pair of NIke sport shoes and looking so happy and cool, won't you start to have an idea of ""Wow, those shoes look so good""? Even so, is the truth that truning out as a pair of NIke shoes is the reason that we become cooler and happier? Easy enough, the answer is no.","Actually, it is not the game of advertisements that makes most products seem better, but persuasion you by connecting different signals and messages into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them.",0

Another group of people think that do the things they already know and try to do them as best as they can. Wow, these two ways seem that they work. What do you think? Now , I will tell you my opinion, I agree that success is to try new things and take risks. Well, I am not saying that you won't be a successful person if you just do what you already know and do it as well as you can. What i mean is ""improvement comes from trying"".

475475.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river.","The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago.",0

1015996.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. Successful people always think about new things. Because that is their confident behaviour to achieve their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses.",He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job.,0
543170.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products.",They know what the customers want.,0
1082317.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior. Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession. Another reason ,I believe that taking risks and trying new things brings success because it brings creativity in a person which leads to success in life.",When we try new things in life then our brain works faster and we feel more challenging.,0

Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts. It is hard to catch the main ideas, students may only be interested in the stories, but didn't know the meaning. It can't happen when you focus on the ideas or the concepts. Because the concepts and ideas are the standard for whole stories. In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content of this course. Although the facts can let them know how to use it in society, it still limited. However we can't refuse it and it can lead to students getting some experience. It is still not general for the students. Finally, the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course. The facts concluding different types of knowledge. They are all useful. But the knowledge which is discussed in the course may lead students to the wrong way. They may try to take more focus on other courses. It is better to teach them the ideas and the concepts, because the ideas and concepts can keep leading students in the correct way about the course. Although I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts, it is still helpful to learn the facts.",The facts can give students some experience to let them not make the same mistake as the previous people.,0

So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society.

380681.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Before starting with my opinion of the topic i must say that in this life what is the most important thing about a product? So if we want to respond to this question we can say that the image of a product is very important but it's only a vision. So I agree with the topic. The advertisements make products seem like good images, so people are involved in buying these. They show us the best quality of products and not the reality. An example is if you want to buy a car you see that this car is the best for speed, or elegance, or horse power, or other characteristics but you don't see what is the consumption , if the power of this car is economical. But the advertisements are in all our lives, because if you watch TV shows or programs there are many breaks in advertisements, if you read a newspaper there are pages and pages of advertisements, when you go to work or only you go out in the streets you can see more and more advertisements.

I was a student , I left school in july. In my university, there are one million people. Today, we are friends, but when we leave school, we will fight each other. Secondly, young people should have their own house. But it is too expensive to buy for young people, who leave school just now.

Governments encourage people to use public transportation rather than their own cars, and this will decrease the numbers of cars. For example, the Korean government already have a practical policy which makes people prefer public transportation. The government encourages people who use public transportation to take their taxes less. However, people who have their own cars should pay much more taxes, according to the new policy. As the new policy stated, many people try to use public transportation, and this decreases the number of private cars. Second, new technologies develop to substitute cars, such as monorails, private air crafts, and these equipments will be practical immediately. There have been many research efforts to create new transportation which is better than cars, and finally these days, these efforts are gaining their results. For example, many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in ordinary places, because air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars these days.","About two years from now, they succeeded in the development, and according to some newspapers, it will be practical in ten years from then.",0
1039658.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts. People these days seem to pay a lot of attention to ideas, but the fact is, this has made a lot of useless 'inventions'. Because  of this, I saw a new 'invention' the other day. It was a little fan that could be tied on the arm, which could be used for cooling off the hot noodles while people were picking up the noodles. The fan is not tiny, but even if it is, is there really a lot of consumers for this kind of product? I do not think so. If i were the customer, i wouldn't even bring a fan to a restaurant just to cool off the noodles. This is one example of people only getting the idea but not the fact. As a matter of fact, many of the concepts and ideas are theories, which just came from hypethosis. If every student does not pay attention to the facts that are in daily life, how will they be able to find out or even to do labs without a habit which is called ""to discover themselves""? Ideas and concepts seem to be very important, but if they are just there without facts, I do not think there will be anybody to be able to understand them. It is the twenty-first century, society and technology are updating everyday, if people only get the ideas and concepts in the text book instead of getting the facts, they will not be able to fit into this society very well, due to their lack of methods that will work the best and creativity. And those methods and creativity came mostly from the fact that they have 'stored' day by day.",'Students' are now the 'people' in the future.,0

Oil prices are a principal problem for western countries which haven't their own oil supplies.

336929.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"When asked about what kind of knowledge is good for a person's life. Many people may hold the issue to learn as much as specialized knowledge in one specific subject and think that is a prime argument. But, some people, however, are taking a fresh look at it. As far as I am concerned, I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic  subjects, although there may be several merits to specializing in one specific subject, for example, more expertized and more deeply knowledge. Among countless reasons that influence my opinion, there are three conspicuous aspects that follow. We may look into every possible reason, however, the foremost one is that broad knowledge is good for fitting into the development of the world today. Nowadays, people can get as much information from many different methods. They should have the ability to be familiar with huge amounts of information and treat it correctly. And if they want to reach that level mentioned above they must have a lot of different knowledge of a great number of subjects. Also, it may be arbitrary to judge my preference only by using the argument mentioned in the above paragraph. There is another reason that deserves some words here. For individual perspective, broad knowledge will give a person more choices for career. They can choose many different areas to develop their own business.",And they can use the broad knowledge to help them make more successes and that will be much easier for them to exert the broad knowledge in a whole.,0

Many customers believe everything they see and buy the product if they see that the information that the company is giving them about the products makes it seem good. Because of the people that buy things when they see them in the advertisements companies think that it is a smart way to sell and will continue using it until someone puts a stop to it.","An example from everyday life is when you want your parents to give you permission to do something you know is not right, in this case you tell your mom all thegood things about it and leave out all the bad things that it has and could have.",0

1150000.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the author's statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"". It is said that "" God will help them those who help themselves "" , it is implied that they take the risk and try out new things which may lead to great success. For example if Edison had not tried for a new thin he would not have invented the electric bulb. If Newton had eaten the apple, he would not have known the law of gravity. Always it is better to take calculated risks when ever required which helps us to flourish in life. When risk is taken the reward is sure some day. It is suggested that you try a new thing ,experiment which leads to development and growth in the field you are interested in. Aim for stars atleast you can seeeach moon. A good example for successful people is Gandhi, the father of the nation of india ,he tried a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took as much risk as he could , Finally he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land.",Thats why the risk is always rewarded which is for a good cause for the maximum benefitof mankind.,0
1661173.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students are of different types and the way of preparing for their subject and the way they approach the subject are different when compared to each other. Some people go around the concept and the ideas of the subject and what the main aim and the use of the subject are and they go in a different manner to get the subject. Some students just blindly take the text books,and not only text books and they collect a lot of material and they just go blindly reading those facts that are in the books and material,so in this case the students wont get the practical knowledge of the subject and just blindly know what the subject is. These people cant do the practical problems and they cant go deeper into the subject. It is also important that after getting the idea and the concept of the subject the student should go front reading the facts regarding the subject. That makes a lot of knowledge regarding the subject. I strongly agree with the statement""It is more important for students to understand the ideas and the concept of the subject than it is for them to learn facts"". Students who go in the manner of understanding the idea of the subject and the purpose of the subject and how the subject is inter related with the other topics will get a good idea of the subject. Unless the student gets the idea of what the subject is and what the concept behind writing all these tasks in a subject it is used less for the student to do a course. A student who goes along with the idea and the concept of the subject gains a lot of grip on the subject and he may produce any thing regarding the subject on demand. For example,let us take a student who is having a subject in C language on his/her course,the student who first goes through the text book and gets the idea of the language and what the subject is and what is needed for programming in a C language can write a technical program for a small application based on C language. On the other hand the student who goes through the facts of the subject will not get the practical idea and he cant produce an application in C language. How can he produce an application with out knowing what is the main idea of the subject and what is the concept that outputs an application in C language.","Even the student who is having a course in Maths in his academic year,if he goes along with the facts that are related to the subject how can he solve a problem related to the subject of mathematics.",0

For example, cars, if people are eager to buy new models of cars, and they do not try to do something new, how boring, we do not have a lot of options, but because they take risks we have numerous options when we are looking for a car, you, me, everybody can buy all kinds such as: a BMW, a Jaguard, a Camry, a Jeep, etc. Also, people who want to start a new restaurant, the want to open something new.","If in the area where they are going to build this new restaurant there are some Chinese, Greek, or Thai food, but they do not have real Mexican food, I think that the best thing they can do is start a restaurant that is not in this area.",0
478851.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do. If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first. People need to try new things. Furthermore,in schools. Teachers ask questions of their students. Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question. Even if the solution that the student did is wrong,this is the best way of learning the right thing for students. Especially in Mathematics classes. Even though I was not sure about the solution,I always wanted to try to solve it and I was always the volunteer. Last but not least,the way which goes to succeed is not always clear,there are often difficulties. For example,someone wants to study abroad,brings everything in his back and goes to the country where he will study. In this situation,he takes a risk of losing all his relationships with friends and even with his family. Moreover,he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country. If he needs help,then there is nobody at the first times when he goes to this country. On the other hand,at the end of these risks,he will return to his own country knowing new languages and being a graduate from a university,new opportunities etc. There is only one thing why he did so many things,just to be successful, to be an important man in his job. All in all,as i said before,for being successful,taking risks is the most important thing. Both,if someone takes risks then at the and of that,it is surely that he will be able to manage this,and if someone gets successful for the first time, it is not about being successful.","My motto is,experience is the mother of wisdom.",0

Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors.

Firstly, without any tour guide, our travel will be more flexible for planning where to go or when to go.

Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study. They are not afraid of troublesome things they feel that they can manage the whole world. They have not always been accepted in society for being problematic and for driving crazy at their parents. They are noisy people. In the end for adults used to be totallydifferent. They get enjoyment by other ways. Spend time with the family, go on a quiet vacation, read a good book, go to an orchestral concert, work at home, do the house work, are some of the activities which adults prefer to enjoy themselves.

378807.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life. It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts.

Not being able to understand ideas and concepts and then predicting or learning facts means wanting to run not being able to learn how to walk. For example there are two students in the same class. They are good friends there. Student A tries to understand basic things and after all the notion. He wants to be the top in class. But Student B just tries to understand cause and effect. His aim is to get enough marks in class. Do you ever wonder why teachers try to teach notions. I did, the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger. I mean their aims are not just to get the highest marks. When students learn ideas, concepts etc. he/she can develop that subject. He/she really should be the competent of this subject. In addition, a student who wants to be an engineer, he/she has to learn all about the subject if s/he really creates a unique thing or innovation. To sum up, you have to make our way between these Student A and B. Which one do you want to be? Just get enough marks in the exam, and make your GDP 2. 01 and go to an ordinary college or be the top student in class, and make your GDP 3.",0 and go to Harvard University.,0

In the olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking. the invention of the wheel changed the evolution greatly. after the invention of the wheel man introduced many new vehicles for transportation. he initially used bullock carts,tongas which were pulled by animals. In later life he introduced bicycles ,which served him well for travelling later he introduced motor cycles inorder to reach quickly with less effort,inthis process man thought of a luxurious way of travelling and he started to introduce vehicles running onfuel. he designed some of them for transportation of goods ,and some for humans,such as trucks and buses. And he later thought about the luxuries and privacy ,then brought the cars. cars were luxurious means of transportation in the early days. but it is compulsory now. this change has occurred because of globalisation and necessities. in the initial stages there were very fewcars ,people used to see it very intently. but nowadays in the developed countries many people have more than one car. The main problem with cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution. for this reason many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding more taxes  and parking fees. But people are ready to pay for that because they very much desire it. the question is that there will be fewer cars in 20 years than now but ithink it will not happen. people possessing cars will not throw them out.

Young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their youth and things that are available to young people. First, in my opinion, young means full of energy, especially in physical conditions. Most young people have the best or better body conditions than older people. These conditions make people able to do many things like studying, playing sports, drinking alcohol etc. For example, when sportsmen get old nearly 40, they usually retire because their physical conditions are not strong enough to continue that job. Moreover, when people get older, they keep on destroying their brain cells whether they want to or not.

Alternative solutions are found with inventions. So though it may sound strange after looking at the ever increasing sales graphs of the auto companies,I feel there will be fewer cars after twenty years than there are today. Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers. Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call. Retail giants like walmart and food kings like McDonalds are accessible over short distances. These things virtually eliminate the need to go out,drive and shop. With the advent of the internet, it is very much possible to work from home. With means like video conferencing the members of a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe. E-learning has opened new horizons. Classes and even archives are available online. These things help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest, reducing the need to go out everyday. The population is a huge problem faced by many countries as it is linked with limited resources like land. It results in heavy traffic seen on the roads. Most automobiles today run on petrol products which are getting extinct. Also they depend on the political aspects like relations with some oil producing countries. We can have an alternate solution for that like renewable energy like solar power but the effectiveness of it is still a doubt.

People who make ideas for advertisements always try to find creative and impressive ideas. In my view, it can't be avoided for companies to make products seem much better than they really are in their advertisements. There are so many advertisements in the world and companies want people to be interested in their products. Besides, to make interesting advertisements, they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points. First, most advertisements are made to grab people's eyes. For example, we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on TV. However, they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences. But every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently from others, because they need to grab people's eyes. And it will be connected right away with their selling.

In our parents' period, it was really different, everyone helped everybody. Today this period is revolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon. First, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60's or 70's. Young people always pretext they don't have time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old,we, young people, always have the feeling that we are too busy. We have personal work, group projects, sports etc but in our planning, there is no time for anything else. Well, I say that but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we would prefer going 3 weeks on holiday rather than staying one week to help a charitable cause. There should be another reason why young people are careless. Secondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individual and egoist society. Everyone thinks about him or herself. Young people believe less in God than before, that could also be a good reason. There are not a lot of religious events. But religion is an efficient way to get people around a good cause in order to help other communities.","And all of it is just the consequence of the environment of a society or a lack of values, education.",0

Among the divers reasons I support this opinion, there are two reasons. First, through understanding ideas, students may become more logical than before. For example, when I was a high school student, I would attend the experiment in science class in the laboratory. it makes me solve the teacher's prompt which makes me get a complicated theory inscience. In addition , the course in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomena such as global warming , soil erosion, and so on which make me a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, I agree that students must focus on understanding rather than learning facts since they would be logical. secondly, as students under standing ideas, they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which make all around the world thrive more than before. For example, when I was a middle school student, I would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness. Back then ,particularly, my geography teacher had a special characteristic which explained to understanding ideas until a number of students perfectly grasped the contents of geography.

It means more knowledge brings more power. I strongly agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better. There are some reasons why having broad knowledge of academic subjects is better because of application in other fields and various experiences. First of all, by having different kinds of academic subjects, we can apply to other different fields. For example, if a construction company has a plan to build a new modern style building in a city. In this case, the first thing we can think about is that a company must need an architect, who builds buildings. If architecture has broad knowledge of other academic subjects , then it would be better for making buildings. He can use various subjects such as art, math and geology in order to build a building. In addition,modern society needs people who are able to do multitasking jobs. Moreover, having various academic subjects can make people have different experiences.","For instance, I majored in business at school.",0

I do not agree with the claim. According to me, the number of cars will continue to increase though there might be a change in the technology which they use. As the population continues to grow, so do the needs. And the car is emerging as a basic need of the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, true. The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline in prices will continue as technology progresses. This would further encourage their sales in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one. In earlier times, cars were meant only for the main members of the family, the earning heads.

Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same. I believe, traffic is not just a waste of time; in addition, it is a waste of energy. For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour.",It means that everyday I spend 1 hour on theroads.,0

All is studied to make it attractive, brilliant, colourful, nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful. It has occurred many times that the product was truly disappointing compared to the advertisement. Of course, it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as ""fabulous"" as they were supposed to be. I spent some money on various things, from CDs to a DVD player, beauty products for my sister or very diverse things, which happened to be smaller than they were said to be, less efficient or to break very easily. My brother, who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be.

I do not think they are really enjoying their life. On the other hand, there are some old people who really like to go out and hang out with their friends. my host mother is an example of an old person who enjoys her life even more than me. she is in her 60s now and she loves to go out with her friends and go shopping. when she does not have work to do she always makes an appointment with her friends to do something. she never likes to be home all day doing nothing.

Firstly, I am going to vacation to relax and spend my time without any worries. A tour guide will be with me then I will not have to worry about hotel reservations and find good restaurants.

First, traveling alone enables us to feel free to move on the tour site. Some people may think that moving to new places alone is dangerous because we do not know about the places. In my opinion, However, traveling alone can benefit us to have more chances to see sight seeing. For example, If I tour with other people on time, I cannot see museums and churches that I want to visit except determined sites. Then I do not feel satisfied with the tour. In this way, I can say that traveling along gives us more chances to visit than traveling in a group.

1697010.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although older people can enjoy life, I definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people can enjoy eating, travelling, and being healthy. First, young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young. For example, when young people want to eat some great dishes, they can eat all of them. They can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot. However, usually, older people cannot eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot. Not only can young people enjoy eating, but they can also enjoy travelling. If the person who is young wanted to go somewhere, the person could go there soon. The person does not need a lot of preparation for the trip. However, if the person who is old wanted to go on a trip, the person would need a lot of time to prepare for the trip. So, young people are very flexible and aggressive.

Indeed, everybody thinks about themselves so young people have grown up in this atmosphere of ''me and myself''. Life goes fast and we want to pursue and achieve our plans because today everything is planned per advance and there is no time for civic behaviour. In addition, globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identificationproblem: which communities are for which people? Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fights between them. So, there is no unity in this world why would young people change this by helping who and with which means? Modern life makes young people very narcissistic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be useful. Some will help the oldest and disabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them. Others will come into an association to create a better life place for their community.

If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics call I will use the concepts and ideas to get to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts there will be times when they will not help get the solution.

People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living.","I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life.",0

Currently, A lot of people do nt have a lot of time as much as a long time ago. Therefore, time has become very important in our student life. Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example.

693304.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","My opinion is that, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, in twenty years' time. I will explain these with three supporting reasons. First of all, new transport can be created. Our life is rapidly improving by technology development. There will be a car which flies in the sky, or intermediate moving vehicles from one place to another in one second. This new technology makes people not use a car because it will require less energy to operate and it will be more convenient, and faster than today's car. Secondly, People use public transport rather than their own cars. every year, the number of people who use public transport such as buses, trains and subway is increasing. According to the statistics, the reason why they take public transport is it takes less money, less time and is convenient. If they have their own car, it costs a lot of money to fill petrol, parking fees, taxes, car insurance and fixing the car. As well as this, the cost of petrol is rapidly increasing. Also, there are terrible traffic jams every morning. This is a reason why people use public transport rather than their own car. This will make fewer cars than today in the future.

Advertising may make anything better by a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be the fascination towards the product. and looks matter alot. for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you. isn't it? that is where advertising comes into the picture. Its magic of advertising. Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. as we all know, that anything in this world is not perfect. All things have dark sides too. So, with a little help from advertising, we can highlight the positive points of some products and can hide the negative parts. for instance, lets take the example of cold drinks like, cola, pepsi etc. these drinks are so popular among people. but the question is why are they? while we know that these drinks are not good for your health. even then they do a great deal of business all over the world. The credit of this should go to the advertising. advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular.","Nowadays, even some schools are providing training in how to do advertising.",0

Some of them believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I am hesitant to agree with the statement, and the reasons are listed below. Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them. Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather. And I am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being, cars will become more popular. Admittedly, Many people think that the number of cars will be decreasing, because they cause a great deal of pollution, and people nowadays pay special attention to the environment. Nevertheless, I deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finally varnished, with the development of techniques. And we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by the UN, that a car made with the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before. In conclusion, though the cars face the problem that they pollute a great deal today, I think the number will not be fewer, because more and more people can afford them, and such great comfort and convenience they offer, and, the most important.",the advantages of techniques.,0
1082317.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior. Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession.

According to this phrase, I think that people who try to do new things normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who simply does his/her usual job. What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to society. A lot of men can do things well, but only men who do things better than others can reach a higher level in social life. Taking risks is part of being a successful person. Someone who does not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by society.

I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products.",So it will even cause the situation worse than now.,0

Parking it is becoming a real challenge,and the frustration that builds everyday is taking up very big proportions. The statistics showed that in twenty years the population of the world will be at about six billion. Right now we are only four billion. What that means is that the level of pollution of the air will be unlivable for any human kind. The space available per person will decrease and the drivers will have an increase in anger. Unfortunately we are able to see that in Indonesia right now. Their problem is that everybody uses a car. Therefore,living in a confined country,with an increasing population doesn't allow for a sanitary and better life. So,to avoid this problem,we should decrease the number of cars by simply applying a few rules. First of all,we should make a law that forbids people to drive by themselves. What i mean is that cars should be considered for a minimum of four people. If that doesn't happen the owner of the car shouldn't be allowed to drive,penalty a ticketor worse. Then the community should make available more community rides like buses or any other vehicle that holds more people than a car. Doing so, we should be able to decrease the number of cars, the pollution of the air,the gas consumption, which nowadays is reaching incredible prices and we should be able to decrease the frustration and anger of everybody.

By having deep information and significant experiences on an issue, people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job, salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area. The first advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compared to other people. Because, companies today generally look for people with a specific topic. The reason for this is that today's companies are working on a detailed subject. It is clearly seen that there are not so many companies that work in different areas.

1110655.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly disagree with advertising activities making products seem much better than they really are. This is a case of manepulating customers' decisions. Some times this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees. Companies and goods sellers should talk and describe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising them in a proper and honest way are mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials of high quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are. Another way of fair advertising activities, is highlighting the efforts that were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection.

832287.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my country, there is an old saying ; to teach the way of taking fishes instead of giving fishes. It says the importance of learning not only the facts but also the "" way"". But it highlights the importance of the way. Like this old saying, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. First, If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions. For example, when I was a middle school student, at the start of math class, I couldn't understand what the teacher said. But finally understood the way of solving the math problems, I could solve another math question. Although that question was more difficult, I understood the way of solving it so I could do it. If I couldn't understand, I couldn't answer that question. Second, If students understand ideas and concepts, they can imagine more ideas and concepts. I mean, for instance, when I was a high school student, I learned about poetry. Most people don't like poets because of their words.",Those words were difficult to understand except by the teacher.,0

I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities. We know that it could be important even for our own future, but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away. we try to keep every thought, every occasion, every second that is going away. and we are not able to stop and think about so important things. We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world. because change happens. but the problem is: will it be better? we don't know.",but we will think that we were happy when we were young.,0
115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it, I learnt several new rules about sport, so it encourages me to play it. The other example is about risky. I took a PhD in education for two years in my country. I want to change my education place even if it has many risks. These are spending alot of money, passing the toefl exam, and completing a new phd education in theUS.

Ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt. Because it is only an idea. But the fact is different. Facts must be done in real life. I think it is more important to learn facts than ideas. Because facts are real but ideas are not. You can learn so many ideas about something but you can't apply these ideas in real life. It is not important if you don't apply ideas in real life. But if you know facts you can apply them immediately when you hear ideas. But if you know only ideas you cant do anything in real life. For example an electronic engineer can know how television works. But he/she knows only the idea of how it works. I think this is not important. In real life people dont pay attention toideas. People pay attention to facts. Because facts are real and applicable. People want to see something. People dont want to hear only ideas. If they see facts then people pay attention toideas. And say ""Ooo it is a good idea,congratulations"". It is a waste of time learning ideas. If you learn facts you also learn ideas about the background of this fact.

When I think of a successful discovery, the first thing that comes to my mind is the discovery of America. Christopher Columbus tried to find a new way to India. But instead of finding a cheaper and better connection to India, he discovered America by accident. He took the risk of failure, because many people believed, that there could just be one possible seaway. The thesis, that the earth is a plate and not a globe, supported their idea.

Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. One of the reasons for students to clearly understand ideas and concepts is motivation. If students understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the importance of eating healthily. Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily.

1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold.","The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years.",0

However, young people have a larger scope to enjoy their lives than older people and hence i agree with the statement that'Young people enjoy life more than older people do' Age is always associated with ailments. During old age , these health ailments prevent people from indulging in activities they would have loved to do. For example, outings and adventurous trips are not feasible for them. The younger generation can enjoy the excitement of adventure sports , though not regularly , but surely during the vacations. The activities like driving , gyming are not recommended for older people even though they might find enjoyment in them. The older generation starts looking at life differently.

1058201.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is collected around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority will have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak. Also if knowledge was limited to only one subject, scientistsn't wouldn't have success the success which they have today.

First, tricking customers' eyes is a really good way to get more money. First, you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it look the desired to people. For example, I remember a TV show that was unbelievable to win a sports car if anyone answered the question shown on the screen. However, the question was so easy that I was going to call them.

They just live how their mind guides them through without thinking about consequences. Firstly ,I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything material. They live their life without thinking about the consequences. Indeed, everything they wanted to do is possible, so they just have to realise what their hearts tell them to do.

96404.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is very important for students, and also for other people to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learn facts without knowing what they are. There are three main reasons why it is important. They can remember ideas easily and also last longer, able to get interested in subjects, and increase their self confidence. Firstly, by understanding some ideas, it is much easier to memories and it also lasts longer than just learning without any understanding. Especially for students, they have to prepare for a unit test or provincial exam which is after the whole semester. They need to know the facts properly and remember them in the right way. To give an example of this, during students' studies, they will find unconvinced time if they do not understand the facts that they learned. But if they understand everything, they are able to remember longer and have confidence to prepare for the test. Secondly, if a person understands an idea, it is possible to get interested in it. Because it is the only hard time before he/she understands. After they know what it is, then it becomes a very interesting idea which can get the person very interested in it. For example, if a student does not understand how to multiply, a teacher will teach the student. After the person knows how to do it, math can become a very interesting subject. Lastly, self confidence is really important forstudents. By understanding ideas and concepts about some subjects, they enjoy the time to study which makes them know more and more. This makes the students increase their self confidence. For instance, if a student does not know anything about history, but finally he/she understands, the person thinks of himself as a very smart person, so the student can teach or tutor other friends who do not know about history. To finish with, understanding ideas and concepts, especially about subjects the students learn from school takes very important jobs for students.","They are able to remember longer than not knowing and just study, they have chances to get interested in some subjects, and it also increases self confidencestrongly.",0
182182.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement. I have three reasons why I'm support the statement. First, it is natural to make products seem much better than they really are. The advertisement is about the economy. So, making products seem much better is natural. Please imagine. For example, food. If the advertisement for food doesn't look delicious, Most people will not buy it because it seems to taste bad. Then, the economy doesn't work. Nobody buys it, then, the products disappear. The reason why most people buy the product is influenced by the advertisement. At least, in Japan, most people are influenced by advertising. In fact, I'm one of them. Second,advertisement is a competition between many companies. How can they make people buy them or how can they make their products look good. It is true that the product which I bought was bad. However,it shows how the advertisement has a big influence. Finally, you know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. You should remember them. I think making presents seem much better is a bad thing. But, above all, it is the economy.","So, we can't do anything.",0

I dont get any money for this, I do this because I like it and have fun almost always. Of course there are situations where I am nervous and tired of entertaining children, but all bad emotions vanishes if you can make these kids happy.

I think that it is ironic since most people want to live longer. But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger. First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease. On the contrary to teenagers, adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoying life.

1748079.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","This is a very diplomatic statement to say that the use of cars will decrease in the future. As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them. In this fast growing society, cars do play a major significant role, as they do be very helpful for quicker transportation, because time once lost cannot be regained, and for the world twenty years from now, time will play a very prominent role. There are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars, which would become a major resource for growing the usage of cars in the future. By using this type of car, they have many advantages like the faster mode of transportation, which not only improves one's only status but improves the whole economic development of the country. Because to compete with the development of the countries the citizens should be using their time to the fullest. and the other one is a pollution free environment, which is very important now due to global warming coming as a major consequence innature. In addition its really very hard for any citizen to wait for government mass transportation , who is in an emergency, or planning to go for a picnic with his family members or so and would be more suitable to have his own car than rely on any others. The only thought which brings us to the conclusion that in the next twenty years the number of cars will be decreased is the problems of pollution, traffic congestion, or the scarcity of petrolium products, but there are many alternatives which have been taken as substitutes to these problems. and the usage of modern improvisation in this aspect would capture the imagination of the nation for the alternative use.",and these have been proved through analysis of the last 2-3 years in most of the parts of the world.,0

Free thinking can be helpful in our society. these thinking can produce a more advanced future. just to learn the facts and memorize them block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can. for example , i read the book a few days ago after reading the book i agreed with it. the book includes information about French education. the children learn mathematics in school they have to solve the problem but they can't count the number well. when they learned mathematics they were focussed on remembering the formula and they always studied the same questions. sometimes they faced higher problems but they also depended on the formula. so, oneday their homeroom teacher asked them ""which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2? ""children answered ""1/4"" they knew only a bigger number. they couldn't think about the amount and range and degree. so i suggest that they should be learnd with new ways like experiments and express their thinking,even if it's wrong. another one is about art. art includes alot of things. such as drawing and taking a picture and acting and so on. i want to say about the acting actors or actresses who don't know how to act and speak before getting the paper with their role. they have to act depending on themselves.",and have to imagine and understand the situation.,0

In my opinion older people enjoy life more than youngpeople. Firstly, today, people in the world are more and more. As a young man, they will find a lot of challenges, that means older people can not think. I am a young person, I was born in China, there are too many people. I was a student , I left school in july. In my university, there are one million people. Today, we are friends, but when we leave school, we will fight each other. Secondly, young people should have their own house. But it is too expensive to buy for young people, who leave school just now. Parents stayed at home, although the government would give them some money each month, it was not enough. Yong people must give their parents money to help them.

Indeed, if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you will be more successful in your personal life and in your practical career. First of all, just imagine yourself knowing a huge variety of knowledge. That in fact will make your personal life easier. it will also help you to face many problems in your daily life.

735597.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life. Nowadays, schools are almost every where in the world, where people would try to get as much education as possible, so they can be the top person. Almost all modern schools teach many subjects to the students, such as Maths, science and history. However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better. Not only is information going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future. In order to get into a good company or create a good company. People do not need all the subjects to do this.",The only thing is the strength you have over the others.,0
246942.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I do not agree that a group tour with a guide can provide us with the best trip for several reasons. First, if we hire a tour guide, we can not travel according to our decision, which may limit our interest in the trip. Second, concerning cost effectiveness, we should spend much more money on the tour which is followed by a tour guide. Third, I would like to travel with my family and my best friends. On a group tour, we should spend a lot of time with strange people. When I travel, I usually plan my schedule and destination of the trip by myself. I would like to travel freely and comfortably. I think that a tour guide tends to earn money from their tourists. For example, a tour guide may take tourists to expensive souvenir shops which pay the tourguide money for their contract. In an economic point of view, tour trips with guides should be more expensive than self arranged trips because tour fees include their salary. If we plan our trip by ourselves, we can choose a hotel and restaurant. However, we take part in a group tour, our trips are fixed in the selection of accommodation and restaurants. I think that a group tour led by a tour guide should be boring. I have never used a package tour like a group tour because I like to plan a trip.",Researching about travels using the internet and some timetables allows me to have fun.,0
1048805.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I can not agree with the statement which is that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I actually think the statement is the opposite, which is that older people have enjoyed life more than young people have in recent years. In my country, Japan, there are many young people who do not do anything; they are staying at home and they do not go to school, do not go to work, or do not do part-time jobs ; they do not want to do anything, or they do not know what they want to do. Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in. And many older people have worked for a long time in some office or in their home as housewives. So, they want to use the time for themselves this time. They know how to use the time moreover, they have desired if they quit jobs, they want to go hiking or traveling, spend their time doing their hobbies. They try to use the free time as they want, which is that they enjoy their life. There are two big differences between young people and older people. It cannot be said all young people are the same as non-desired people or all olders are the same as desired people. However, it is true the non-desired young people are increasing in our society. Japan is the country where there are most a-long-age people in all over the country. Thus, that is a very good situation, which older people enjoy.",They can help increase Japanese life motivation especially for young people who do not enjoy life.,0

Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups.

By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented java,we can't understand the features ofjava. we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts. facts can also Improve knowledge. By studying the facts like Independence we should know about the great leaders of our country ,and we should know about how they will work hard for Independence. History will tell about this. So learning the facts was Important. By studying the facts the children can learn about the honesty, reliability , and history of the country. Everyone should know about the history of the country. By learning the facts we can prevent wars like the second world war and the first world war. by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods, It was very interesting. last week some of the people found the Dwaraka under the sea, so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were Dwaraka in the past. By understanding the concepts and ideas we can Improve the knowledge of the subject and we can Improve our performance and profound knowledge in the subject. we can't understand concepts like polymorphism and abstraction while learning about the facts.

1058201.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is collected around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority will have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak. Also if knowledge was limited to only one subject, scientistsn't wouldn't have success the success which they have today.","For example, if Nuoten hadn't bothered to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, i don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all.",0

1099127.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The idea that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts neither looks logical nor rational. I would completely disagree with that idea for a lot of reasons. I do think that in order for young people to learn facts of life and science in different specialities in order to be able to have the ideas of their own,otherwise they will just come up with mixed out ideas and concepts. So it is a sort of chronological process. I do not think for example how a student could come up with a certain invention or innovation in a certain machine or subject without clearly taking in all the basic facts of how this machine is working and the basic scientific factors controlling its function or he may end up with catastrophe. Another reason, is that the study of facts broadens the horizon of the student's vision ,then he will be quite capable of finding out the concepts and basic ideas by himself, by studying how every thing in life would work correctly. It is only after passing that stage of basic learning that his ability to investigate and relate new concepts and theories.","Young students tend to be arrogant if they believe that they know concepts and ideas,that would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the facts and be able to use them in the proper context.",0
345389.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When students study, they need to understand what they study, rather than learning the facts of it. Because, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful to understand problems much deeply, much easier to memorise, and much more acceptable for other problems that they have faced. first, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful for students to understand what they study better than facts. When students start to understand the idea and concept of certain questions, they will find what was the cause, and how it works. It's like grapes. All the teeth of guiers are matching perfectly the machine works. Therefore, to understand what they are studying deeply, then they need to understand what the idea of it is. Second, understanding of ideas and concepts will be in students' minds a longer time than learning facts. Because, there are lost of facts in all single questions. If students start to study facts, then they have to memorise all of the facts which is a bigger number than ideas and concepts. Lots of facts can be found in lots of similar type of questions However, those are similar questions, so if the students remember only one idea or concept, then they will be able to solve all of thequestions, instead of remembering all of the factors for each question. Therefore, understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts, so that will remain in students' brains for much longer.","Third, ideas are much more appealing than facts when they have some other problems.",0

Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life.

Not being able to understand ideas and concepts and then predicting or learning facts means wanting to run not being able to learn how to walk. For example there are two students in the same class. They are good friends there. Student A tries to understand basic things and after all the notion. He wants to be the top in class. But Student B just tries to understand cause and effect. His aim is to get enough marks in class. Do you ever wonder why teachers try to teach notions. I did, the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger.

1570522.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I think its true that most young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy their life more than some old people in an age of 70 bi 75. young people have all their power and don't have to think about their health anddeath. old people have not so much patience and some are really frightened about their death, so they live with thoughts all around their death and so they are not so happy as young people. But if someone is old but still has enough power to do sports and if he will be happy too. When a person has a religion and believes in a life after death, it would help him or her a lot not to think always about death. So I think that young and old people could both be unhappy or happy in their lives. when I think about it, I come to the conclusion that you can ` t say that old people don`t enjoy their lives as much as young people do, its different from person to person. young people have more power than old people have but old people have seen more in their lifetimes than young people, learned more and know more. young people have more problems with love, school and self - confidence and old people have more problems with death and solitude alone. Young people and old people enjoy their lives together. young people do more sport or go to the disco and dance, but old people can read and learn and have no work to do They say that they can`t enjoy that. i think you can`t say that young people enjoy their lives more than old people do.",I think if you enjoy your life or not is only on everyonehimself.,0
1499867.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"An old saying ""A jack of all trades and a master of nothing"" suggests that a person should not try to have more of the broad knowledge of each and every subject but should be focussed on a single subject. So many other sayings were developed in the past related to this thing only like ""Little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" but they were the ones which were stated a long time back and are not valid today. Talking about the present scenario where success has become every man's need,a person who is just having knowledge on one subject can climb the stairs of a ladder that could lead him to a successful path. Its not bad to be focussed on but not salubrious in the current era. Focussing on one subject can have many diverse effects. Having knowledge of one subject the job areas to which the person can apply will be restricted. He will be able to apply for some of the jobs only, which could lead to more frustration and more tension as he will not be able to apply for jobs that may lead to fulfilling his major dream.

""Tour guides usually offered you a tight schedule which meant you were in a hurry all the time, and therefore you could not enjoy yourself much on your trip. A tour guide usually planned your schedule tightly from the early morning to midnight. You could seldom enjoy yourself as you were too busy moving from one attraction to the other attraction. I think most people have experienced it before. While you wanted to stay a bit longer at one attraction, the tour guide would tell you to go back to the shuttle bus and you could just stay at that attraction for a maximum of 30 minutes. You were not able to understand deeply about the real life of that country or the attraction because you would not have enough time to explore it by yourself. You needed to be prepared for a long and boring explanation before you could visit the attraction. You also needed to wake up early in the morning for the full schedule for the whole day and you would be able to go back to your hotel at midnight. The schedule offered by the tour guide was not always suitable for your own habits. Maybe you didn't like roller coasters but they would take you to the most famous theme park in that country. And you would be staying in the theme park without playing anything except looking at your groupmates playing happily for the whole afternoon.

Doing what you already know to do will not take you anywhere if it is what most people do. Many of the best inventions in the world were the outcome of risks taken by ordinary people, just like you and me. We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects. A short example to help me prove my point is the following: There is a man that has been doing the same work over and over again, his life doesn't change. He is good at what he does but just like him, many others are good likehim. If this man would try out new things to change some of the things he does in his normal routine and find a way to be more efficient, he could change his life. He is the only person who can actually do this. Taking risks is good to do once in a while. Business men are known to be risk takers. In business, many decisions have to be made. Once a simple decision can make a difference to the final outcome. Some times you might have taken a risk that you didnt want, but it happens to be a success. We should also learn from our mistakes in order to not make them again. Also everyday we make simple decisions with out even realizing it.

The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children. Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze.

1460175.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people think that studying many academic subjects to get broad knowledge is better than concentrating on one specific subject. However, I do not agree with the opinion and think that people getting specialized knowledge will be beneficial to our society for the following reasons. To begin with, our society ,recently, should get human resources to get specialized knowledge in many areas such as technology, economy and policy. Because unprofessional people can lead society - country, company, party etc. - to the miserable status. The negative results of companies operated by unprofessional owners can be a good sample. For example the famous Koreancorporation 'Daewoo' went bankrupt some years ago, because the owner ignored the advice of professional staff.","At the same time, modern society has expanded its area.",0
66530.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people have a lot of power and energy. If they don't use those for enjoying life, I think that is a very wasteful way to live. They should use those at a young age. Now I am young. I am a high school student. I think I enjoy my life more than older people. To go somewhere with my friends, to go shopping with my family, to chat with unknown people on the Internet, to find pictures, to find friends, and more whatever. Some of them are needed to young power. Some older people can do these things. But when I become an older person, I think I can't do these things. Because I will lose power. I might be tired early. I know I will become like my thinking. So I have to enjoy my life now. However, older people enjoy their life by using money. They go on big trips, to get houses, and to eat rich foods etc. This enjoyment is different to young people's enjoyment. They want to relax. They won't use such a weapon. I think our feelings of enjoyment and their feelings are different. They enjoy their life, and we enjoy our life the same as the others. If we are enjoying different feelings, I cannot say which is nice, or bad. All people enjoy their life.",I think that's very nice.,0
125348.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"To have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to learn many things in different fields of study. To specialize in one specific subject is to look at one thing from one point of view. In my opinion, it is better to have both of them as a part of your academic development, and they are both equally important. What truly happens in every person's academic development is that this person goes through different equally important stages. In the first stages of a child's life, this child learns how to speak, and then he or she learns how to write. This is general information that everyone should start with at the beginning of their academic life. Then comes school, whatever, or wherever this person gets their education is all called school; Although, there are some differences that occur at the level of that education. In school, people are taught all the essentials of life, and a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, including different sciences, mathematics, arts, music, and languages. These are the foundations each and every one of us need in our life. As school education comes to an end, different people start to specialize in different subjects of their interests. Later on in life, we are approached by university; by we, i am referring to people who are looking to pursue further education. University is where we are supposed to narrow our choices down, and choose specific fields of study. That is when it is proper for a person to specialize in one specific subject; in other words, major in something they are attracted to. In the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their lives, and that is why they have to choose something they truly love. In conclusion, to have broad knowledge of an academic subject, or to specialize in another are all equally important. You have to get a broad education first, and then narrow it down to what comforts you most.","It is like, watching the rain fall, and then waiting for the rainbow to appear.",0
115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it, I learnt several new rules about sport, so it encourages me to play it. The other example is about risky. I took a PhD in education for two years in my country. I want to change my education place even if it has many risks. These are spending alot of money, passing the toefl exam, and completing a new phd education in theUS. They didn't know how much money I spent before. I also didn't know Whether or not I would pass the toelf an complete new education. I take People who are successful and develop themselves by trying new things. They create new methods to do something, so they help them to try new things. Now, we assume that a student who is preparing for toefl. He develops new studying methods, so he finds a better solution for studying. Then, he can use the methods for the other exams such as gre.",Every person who has alot of successes tries to do new things because of their life style.,0

They prefer to live in safety. That's why they do not want to change their conditions. But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves. There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some people think that they are only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. Through these experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his internship. He worked as a worker in a building. During his internship, he experienced and learnt how he could build a strong building. Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well.

114142.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics call I will use the concepts and ideas to get to generate a solution to the problem.

They are freer than before, they have more rights: politically, the individual aspect is more developed in this generation than in previous generations can we say young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities? I disagree with this statement because I think young people are under the influence of globalisation. I think we cant say young people dont give enough time to helping their communities since young people are working for global problems like individual rights of all people in the world, human rights, environmental problems or food supply like in African countries so the concept of their country disappears and young people are thinking of a global viewpoint. Another reason for my dissatisfaction is that young people are first educated in their countries.",Later they are working in their countries with their colleagues.,0

What one person enjoys doing in life , the other person might think to be boring and uninteresting. However, young people have a larger scope to enjoy their lives than older people and hence i agree with the statement that'Young people enjoy life more than older people do' Age is always associated with ailments. During old age , these health ailments prevent people from indulging in activities they would have loved to do. For example, outings and adventurous trips are not feasible for them. The younger generation can enjoy the excitement of adventure sports , though not regularly , but surely during the vacations.

1244220.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons. Firstly, if a person is focused on a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge, because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field. Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people to know many things from a superficial view; it is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field. I can concide that broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff. But that is not usually the common case because most people work in medium or large companies. Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself.",Usually general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be inserted.,0

Recent activities such as new programs which aim to encourage people to use their creativity in the projects. Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result.

Others, however. Contradicting the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, and I would agree because I think travelling with a tour guide has more advantages. There are numerous reasons why I need a tour guide. I would like to here explain a few of the most important ones. The main reason is that the tour guide has a lot of knowledge. It can be given a concrete example we need some subsitudes but we don't know where we can buy them. In other words,we need a tour guide to help us with how to solve the problem. Another reason why I advocated the attitude of the best way to travel is that in a group led by a tour guide, we can save time by doing whatever we want to do. Take the case of a thing that we want to know which building or something is the most famous on our tour. One very strong argument for the best way to travel is that in a group led by a tour guide, the tour guide can save our life and prevent something dangerous happening. These demonstrate the undeniable fact that we may go somewhere else and we don't know whether the place is unsecure.","Of course, choosing the best way to travel is in a group without a tour guide also has advantages to some extents,like we may go by ourselves and get new experiences in that time.",0

865467.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this statement. I would like to talk about my opinion with 3 reasons. First, It is a problem for us, humans. We already know the earth has a lot of environmental problems. I think CO2 is the most famous cause of destroying the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how convenient a car is. If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can't do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries. I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some people worry about how we charge for electricity. If researchers make more services or think more useful ideas, those will be used by more people. Then, how about the developing countries. The last reason is the problem of developing countries. In some places in the developing country, there is no airport or a train. The people who live in like this area use only a track or a car. If they can not use those, they can't transport some foods or things. I think some areas must develop to improve our own country's situation, so transportation is very important to develop. And this problem is not only this. The developed countries send a lot of used cars which is of course expensive, making CO 2 for the developing countries too cheap.",Those will be more increasing.,0
1113295.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In our century, advertising is everywhere. We have to deal with and to be aware of advertising's tricks. To my mind, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Indeed, the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product. That is why they are ready to say everything which can convince you to buy it. People who do advertising have not the due to say the truth, their goal is only commercial, not educative. So how can we trust advertising? To illustrate this fact, we can take the example of Mc Donalds. If we look at the advertisement for this restaurant, we can learn that the meals are usually very dietetic, they are not bad for the health and the pictures of the meals are really teasing. But according to the experience of Mc Donalds' food in Supersize me, we can see that, this food is not good for the health. To give another example, we can consider make up advertisements.

1470044.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students have a number of ways to learn nowadays. Personally, it is much better when I study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea. I believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than facts is the best way to succeed. Learning facts is very hard to keep because you could forget them over time, Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments, And finally students' skills can be enhanced. It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the battle started, what the conditions were after the battle finished, and so on. It could be in your brain longer than learning facts. Understanding concepts could be valuable when you are studying a different topic. For example, the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict. On the other hand, if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even, maybe you have to study again for your business or your geography class. Students could develop better skills if they learn concepts and ideas. They could argue for example, why the battle happened, or even learn that war conflict is not the best way to thrive. They could even be interested in and pursue a carer in history. I think learning concepts and ideas from a topic, gives you many opportunities for your future life. For all these reasons, I support the statement that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts.","It improves their skills, helps them to other subjects and enhances their skills.",0

I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims. According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense.

There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. First, we always choose the same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to the supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys the same snack. One day, I asked him, "" Why do you choose the same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watch this snack's commercial on television, then I think that this snack tastes good, so I always choose this one. ""I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he is influenced by television commercials , so he always chooses the same snack. Second, we always believe in the content of commercials. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food. My father asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy expensive natural food? ""My sister answered,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food. ""However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there was a lot of value in her natural food, but it was the same as normal food. She was influenced by the advertisement that included her book. Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercials, radio commercials, magazines, books, newspapers, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show the correct information. The meaning of an advertisement is to sell a lot of goods, so when we buy any good, we should research a lot of information, and we should ask for opinions from family or friends.

1758531.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yeh , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, because it will help them to have a grip on the concept. Studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student, the student's knowledge develops only when he thinks about the topic. How did he/she get that thinking? once if they are having some grasp or idea on the topic. The student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity. I am agreeing with the concept because I have had practical experience once up on a time. Two students in my class attended an exam full of practice. I am explaining the practice module of both of the students, one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day without any breakage and also without any idea. And the other person who is also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept. After they arrived after the exam one of the people who prepared the whole night without any breakage told me that the question papper is very hard and I didnt understand the concept of the papper. But the other person told me that the question paper is very easy to answer ,I answered in 1 hour out of 2hours. That much is easy the exam is. he told me like that I could nt get first why they were telling me like that , when asked both of them how they studied I got the answer to my question. On that day itself I understood that instead of memorising the words we will go for understanding which will be very helpful to the person to develop in any way.","FInally I conclude in such a way that people must understand the concept or idea, instead of studying it first we have to study and we have to understand , without that we can't achieve any thing.",0
1134094.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparison to the risk resident people face. However, every human being has to know for himself or herself which goals and objectives he or she wants to achieve and how fast to get there.",In addition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success.,0
481984.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Ok! Today we will talk about being a successful person. Some people think that to be a successful person , you need to try new things and take risks. Another group of people think that do the things they already know and try to do them as best as they can. Wow, these two ways seem that they work. What do you think? Now , I will tell you my opinion, I agree that success is to try new things and take risks. Well, I am not saying that you won't be a successful person if you just do what you already know and do it as well as you can. What i mean is ""improvement comes from trying"". We need to build up our own success we need to try to takerisks. OK, let's say you are in a football team you are the kicker. You work really hard to kick the football everyday and you keep every single step to kick. What you try to do is you never want to make a mistake. You want, once the ball is in front of you, you can kick it in. Ok, finally you are the best kicker. But you forget something.",The way you kick everyday is the old way.,0
236812.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society. From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is because he does not know about the realities. If he had already learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into a puzzle. In addition, students always get more interest in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts. Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt to society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already knew the facts.","Besides, students can also use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas.",0
765235.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. There are many reasons which support the first idea. Firstly, motivation is a very important factor in the academic knowledge process. When a person is interested in one subject he can protect his or her motivation for academic study. Secondly, keeping an order, combining the information about the subject makes a person expert and helps him or her to use and outsource. Thirdly, coordinated and specialized information is always helpful for a person. It also brings happiness and welfare to an individual's life. Another important reason is creating new theories or inventing new things. orders and specialized knowledge can easily produce new ways, theories, inventions etc by the help of its scientific history and experience. On the other hand, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has many disadvantages for an individual like disordered knowledge, unhappiness, endless force for the aim etc. Picking up some things from every subject may make a person feel learned or satisfied but not intellectual. Every cookie and disorderd thing in mind causes stress because a mind never achieves to coordinate them. Intellectual satifying is a influential poison for people who choose the short way to information.",Another thing which is the harmful result of the second idea is losing the way of academic life instead of being creating man for science.,0
644077.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,Many people complain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In my opinion this is true because this is the way companies use to incite people to buy their product, and this is how people can only find out about new products.",0
1200422.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Products that a company makes must look unique and useful in front of the customer through advertisements. Therefore i must agree with this statement: most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Let us take a simple example, chocolate bars. I am sure that you have seen an advertisement for one. Dont you notice the expressions on the faces of the actors who eat that chocolate bar? If i ate that bar i dont think the expression on the face of the actor would come to my face simply from the taste of it. This example is only to clarify the exaggeration in advertisements. If i owned a company i would rather make my products look the best and most useful for the customer therefore other owners would also do the same exact thing. I am not encouraging companies to exceed reality but to use imagination instead of exaguration. since nowadays advertisements take more time than our daily watched programmes, i think the best way to attract consumers is by entertaining advertisements rather than fake ones.",I think that it is the owners' right to show their products in the way they want and also it is the right of the customer to buy the products that suit him.,0
1692161.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments. I believe most of these advertisements make products seem better because they only talk about good things about their products and they also use attractive things, such as people, to fascinate people. Since advertisements only show the benefits of that product, it seems very attractive to people. For example, my mother wanted to have a new vaccum. When she was watching the TV show, there was a commercial about a new vaccine. It said "" this is really powerful and useful! You should buy one! !""or that sort of thing. My mother was fascinated by that and next day, she went to the store and bought one. When she used it, she was really shocked. Although it was really powerful, it made a really loud noise and exhaled a lot of air. She was really mad that the advertisement did not say anything about the noise. Also since advertisements are to attract people, they try to make those nicer, which results in making products seem much better than they really are.","For example, there was a new kind of CD player when I was 12 years old.",0
1751652.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"""Knowing little about many things or knowing more about less things"" is a question that we face many times in our life. The explosion of knowledge in an increasing number of knowledge fields makes this question more provocative. I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer. The life experience and career of a person can support one answer and undermine the other answer. A speciality is a relative concept in this case. Any career needs a certain degree of speciality these days. You can not go to any field without having the necessary knowledge and skills, as well as attitudes, that compromise such a field. I think that the question is related to the level of speciality that one needs. In other words how deep we need to go in the field of speciality.","Another level of the issue is about whether this will isolate us from other fields, i.",0
1928452.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially those who would like to make a success in their life, discuss whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just keep what they already have a knowledge to make a better life. I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life.","For example, the SamSung company which is specialized in the electronic field such as TV, computers and semiconductor products worldwide has been researching new markets and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result, it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people.",0
1049329.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand ideas more than facts. With the development of technology, more and more people pay their attention to learning knowledge. But which is the correct and effective way to learn knowledge? Some people may think that learning the facts is much better than learning from books, but actually they are totally wrong. Since if you want to understand a thing, the only way is to understand the concepts and ideas. First of all, learning ideas is a system and logical study. It is going to help people learn a thing very logically and efficiently. For example, when you face a big problem, the first thing you should do is to find out what is wrong with it and then get to know how to solve it. These processes are all based on the understanding of ideas.","To imagine that you do not even know what the idea is, how can you solve it? Obviously, ideas are more important than faces.",0
1349977.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with the statement. Students have to understand the main ideas and concepts on the one hand, but have to learn the facts aswell. If students understand an idea, they should be able to work the facts out in any case they need them, but only if they know some facts. When a student only learns the facts he will later only know them and might lose the view of the whole topic and thus not be able to answer the question. He might lose himself in details. It is important to learn the facts aswell as the general idea, because you cannot answer a question without having any facts at hand. If a student only learns the general idea and forgets to learn the facts he opposes the problem of not being able to answer a question once again. He might have understood the whole thing, but is not able to present certain facts that are necessary for explaining a specific topic. Therefore an answer won't be possible. When a student has learned aswell the general idea and concepts as the facts he should be able to answer every question on a certain topic, without greater problems concerning his preparation.","he might have other problems, but they are not to be discussed here.",0
1758531.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yeh , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, because it will help them to have a grip on the concept. Studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student, the student's knowledge develops only when he thinks about the topic.",How did he/she get that thinking? once if they are having some grasp or idea on the topic.,0
283847.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with this. It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts. It is a more difficult thing than learning facts. First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts isn't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think most of the kids don't know which of these. Do you know why? Most parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of things. And that makes children interested. Second, the facts and concepts are more specific things. All adults think, they are difficult for children so children don't have to know about that. That is not true. The truth is the adults don't know about the facts and concepts. That's why they say about that. They don't know so the children don't have to know. I think that's kind of stupid. And the adults scared of the kids will learn that something they didn't know. I think it is a very good thing to know about the facts and concepts. I know it's hard, but if you learn that your world will change. Don't you think that's a more interesting thing than just learning from the text? I think yes. So iwant kids to know about the facts and facts. Then they will be interested in lots of things.",If all kids are interested in facts and concepts the world will be a more interesting thing ever.,0
115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend.","After for a while, I was bored playing soccer.",0
1267483.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"""You should go to school, learn a lot of different things. "" That is what parents often said. But I do not completely agree with the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In deed,I support the view that specialization is a good thing. So, people know what they are talking about. In some fields, like men who built houses, specialization is necessary : how could someone as good at painting as a wood table? Furthermore, it implies a longer study if you want to have broad knowledge. Moreover, if someone has broad knowledge, I think it is impossible that he knows accurately all his many academic subjects he has even learned. This is a great problem, there are not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity. You need to be very smart, like Leonard from Vinci. He is a good example. Nevertheless, in contrast to my first explanation, it is important too, to have people who know a little bit about everything. Important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referants between specialists. And because of their knowledge, they will be able to resolve problems and manage a team. That's why they have a great adaptability. To conclude with this statement, i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists. They both complain about themselves.","But like specialized doctors in aesthetic for example, couldn't ze imagine more people who could have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and after that more specialized in one subject ?.",0
1719460.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue. Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances.",There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to.,0

What one person enjoys doing in life , the other person might think to be boring and uninteresting. However, young people have a larger scope to enjoy their lives than older people and hence i agree with the statement that'Young people enjoy life more than older people do' Age is always associated with ailments. During old age , these health ailments prevent people from indulging in activities they would have loved to do. For example, outings and adventurous trips are not feasible for them. The younger generation can enjoy the excitement of adventure sports , though not regularly , but surely during the vacations. The activities like driving , gyming are not recommended for older people even though they might find enjoyment in them. The older generation starts looking at life differently.",They don't enjoy going to the movies and plays which is actually fun.,0
1085283.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts are things that are true no matter what and in pretty much every scenario. Although ideas and concepts can vary. Ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete. Concepts can be altered , modified or even proven to be false. A fact would be, what goes up must come down. That is a proven fact. No matter where you are on earth, whatever is launched up into the air does not matter how high, it will eventually come crashing down back to earth due to the gravitational pull. An idea and concept on the other hand would be the evolution from monkey to man. This is just an idea nothing is for certain about this hypothesis or concept. Many people may believe otherwise, that man's kind originated from Adam and Eve and that they both lived in the garden of Eden.",Although one may be more believable than the other they are just ideas and different concepts made up of different people whom may have influencedothers.,0
197162.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yes, i agree with the statement. Young people are the future of the world,they remain active in their young period but while they get older they losepatience,concentration and the body organs get weak,they may see inactive compared with young people. As young people have many dreams and have many goals to achieve. They work accordingly to achieve their goals and their age is in the stage that they are ready to do anything,young people say and prove 'nothing is impossible'. they can jump,play and enjoy the wholelife to the maximum extent. well about older people they will losetheir patience ,they have to look after the whole family and will face many problems regarding family and now they have no strength to do more work,no strength to dance ,jump and travel.

For example, in 2005 I travelled to Italy with my mother by using a tour company. My mother and I wanted to go to Italy for a long time and so we were looking forward to visiting museums and historical places.","However, there are many museums and famous places in Italy.",0
832287.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my country, there is an old saying ; to teach the way of taking fishes instead of giving fishes. It says the importance of learning not only the facts but also the "" way"". But it highlights the importance of the way. Like this old saying, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. First, If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions. For example, when I was a middle school student, at the start of math class, I couldn't understand what the teacher said. But finally understood the way of solving the math problems, I could solve another math question. Although that question was more difficult, I understood the way of solving it so I could do it. If I couldn't understand, I couldn't answer that question. Second, If students understand ideas and concepts, they can imagine more ideas and concepts. I mean, for instance, when I was a high school student, I learned about poetry. Most people don't like poets because of their words. Those words were difficult to understand except by the teacher. Teacher could understand all of the words.","That is why it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, I couldn't understand because I didn't have any idea.",0

Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more.

Therefore, I think more cars will be sold because more people will get driver's licenses and high technology is innovated. Many people tend to think that cars are very convenient for moving, so they get their driver's licence. For example, almost all my friends have driver's licenses and when we travel, we always travel by car. We like listening to music in a car. In addition, we think cars are convenient because we can go anywhere by car. If we take trains, we often have to walk to our destination. Some friends have their own cars and the rest of them work hard to buy cars. Therefore, cars are needed by many people. Many companies make many cars to show their high technology. I major in mechanical engineering at my university. One day, I went to the plants of Toyota and Nissan to study making cars. The engineers in both Toyota and Nissan make an effort to create new cars.

When viewed in detail the majority ofcountries' means of transport is cars. As per to satisfy the needs of the growing population the usage of cars will definitely increase in the near future which can be a good reason to contradict the statement The second reason is the decline in the cost of. When studied about the statistics from the time of the invention of the car. The cost of cars has declined to a larger extent. This made cars available to the large middle class societies in the world. Since the economic and financial status of the people is increasing, middle class societies are also increasing.

1509352.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People usually think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. But I do not agree with  that. In my opinion older people enjoy life more than youngpeople. Firstly, today, people in the world are more and more. As a young man, they will find a lot of challenges, that means older people can not think. I am a young person, I was born in China, there are too many people. I was a student , I left school in july. In my university, there are one million people. Today, we are friends, but when we leave school, we will fight each other. Secondly, young people should have their own house. But it is too expensive to buy for young people, who leave school just now. Parents stayed at home, although the government would give them some money each month, it was not enough. Yong people must give their parents money to help them. But a young man will have his child also. Thirdly, young people have a lot of friends, some of them are classmates at school, some of them are new friends when they work. They will have some partty, it is a lunge spending. I am a worker now, I will gain 2500 RMB pre-month, which includes all of mine. Give some money to my parents, a part to the house owner, a part to the phone, some to spend on friendship. I have none.

1299460.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts.",Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class.,0

1110655.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly disagree with advertising activities making products seem much better than they really are. This is a case of manepulating customers' decisions. Some times this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees. Companies and goods sellers should talk and describe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising them in a proper and honest way are mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials of high quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are. Another way of fair advertising activities, is highlighting the efforts that were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection.

1730743.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","No,i firmly contradict the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Cars are used for the purpose of travelling from one part to the other and they are considered luxurious and the most important medium of travelling. So ,we can expect a development in technology to provide more and more cars which will have very good mileage and will be comfortable with seats and their pick-ups,instead of a decline in their numbers in the next twenty years. Say for example,there were old fashioned maruti cars (maruti 800,maruti van) and ambassador cars in the 1980s but with the recent development in the technology of cars (like the maruti suzuki swift,scorpio,TATA indica), it has improved the vehicles capability very efficiently. That is accepted by more individuals that fewer and fewer cars will be seen on the roads in the next twenty years. So revolution is in all fields and also in automobile engineering ,so that research will make better cars in future and the purchasers will purchase them and so more cars will be seen. Another important example is that the busyness of the big cities is increasing day by day. So,we can say that there are more and more cars seen on the roads as it was seen twenty years ago and so the predictions are accepted with evidence. From the point of view it is seen that the city gets heavily polluted due to carbon monoxide and smoke which is more and more enforced into the air by vehicles but the increase in the number of vehicles is the obvious thing from this point of view,and the most important factor from thisincrease in the number of cars,purchased by the people and run on the road with more and more in number day by day. So,I support the development of technology,So I, not only support the increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years, but firmly agree with it.","So,the above statement is not at all acceptable from my point of view.",0
524381.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities. However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry for her and regretted focusing on just the quantity of the feasible time. In addition, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never shows one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is an example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyers in Korea. He is renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedication to society. It is evident that he has limited time to do multiple things at the same time. In order to overcome these problems, he has devoted himself to the community in various ways which don't need to take a long time. He provided huge amounts of money for poor people and no one blames him although he doesn't spend enough time. In brief, I strongly support that young people still do their best for the world.",They have their own ways to help others and we never evaluate their trying.,0
1689041.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Nowadays young people are confronting increasing pressure from working and studying, and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday. Although it is true, I still persist that young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is generally accepted that almost all products of new technology are accepted, mastered and being used by young people first, so do the ones to provide convenience and enjoy themselves. Young students, for example, have got used to using cell-phones while their grand parents still use old and big normal telephones.","Although airplanes have been common in China for tens of years, some older people still refuse to travel by airplane, because they think it is dangerous and a waste of money.",0

838581.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, most young people don't know what misery is. I'm talking about countries like France, the USA or Germany, and so on. Countries that are rich. When you have everything you need, you can not imagine that you could help people who would love to have your help. I agree that nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their colleagues. But this is not true only for young people. Nowadays, in our society, everyone thinks about him before someone else. It's called 'selfish'. And i definitely can not agree with this because even if we have the chance to leave in a rough country, poverty exists. Young people and also adults have to pay attention to their community. But if we want young people to help, adults have to show an example. We must have a lot of people who help each other because it is so much easier to live this way. First, when you help someone, you bring him so much happiness that he will feel much better quickly, and you give yourself a good satisfaction by doing it. But the man, or woman you did help will do it for someone else. And this other person for another, and so on. By the way, if you think about this, by helping each other, this is all society who will feel better,and if there are more people doing this, after a while, fewer people will need help. I know it's not possible to solve everyone's problem, but it's a dream that can come true.","There are 6 billion people on Earth, so is it better to have 6 billion people who don't care except themselves, or is it better to have 6 billion people who are crew.",0
216699.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago. The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need. I was kind of addicted to television home shipping a few years ago, the seller in the homeshopping mentioned what kind of people need their product. He said, younger or older ladies and gentlemen.",Instead of saying everybody.,0

Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible.","Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work.",0

Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For the person who wants to know, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point.","Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product.",0
1785403.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In this text i will discuss the question "" Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". First I have to say that everybody will be old one day and this is my first argument. When young people think ""I will be old sometime"" they often think of ""but not yet and I have enough time to enjoy my life! "". Then young people often do something forbidden or something ""freaky"". For example I read about parcour. Parcour means that you run across a city and always run straight on even if there are cars, garages and houses. You just climb up the wall and then jump down and that is what many young people do. For older people enjoying life is often spending time withfamily, going travelling and reading something in which they are interested. For example can everybody remember his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would never have allowed or something like that? And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels? Older people mostly just enjoy their life. But young people are often not allowed to do the things they want to do and often the parents are the reason for that.","So the real question is who can actually enjoy his life? but this would take too long so i will write my opinion on the question ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"" I think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do.",0
263612.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right. Take math for example, during my high school days, I had to answer lots of questions. A math teacher explained the concepts first, and then made us answer questions. If I could understand the concepts, it was not difficult to answer the questions. So when I studied other subjects such as chemistry and physics etc. I applied the same method, that is, understanding the concepst, first. Here is another example. In terms of parenting, especially money related, I think good parents are not the people who can give big money to their children but teach them how to make money. You might think this is a different story, but it is related to the topic, I think.",All parents want their children to be successful and rich.,0

393450.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Whether young or old, many people have expectations of life. They all want to enjoy life, be in a good way for themselves. In my opinion, younger people enjoy life more than older people. There are lots of reasons or facts for young people to enjoy life more. Better physical conditions are good references to make young people enjoy life. Most young young people know that they have a better physical condition than the olders. A young person generally knows that he or she has an undeformed body related to most of the olders and finds himself or herself strong enough to perform a different job. For example they can play football whenever they want but the olds can not. Youngers can also try new and dangerous sports which make them feel excited. Younger people know that their age is an advantage to be in a good manner. Being a young person I know I have a bigger chance to live more than the elderly and that sometimes motivates  me. Before starting a hard job I know I can deal with that job as long as I want. If I face difficulties, I can spare bigger time for my job.

So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society.

115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer.",I want to change something in my life style.,0

Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrast, some think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well. I actually agree with the first idea. these are my following reasons Firstly,success is related toresponsibility.

1888446.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. In order to explain this topic, we can show that this is a controversial point, depending on which condition you look at this situation. First of all, it's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing very quickly, and there are more and more cars on the road. This certainly leads to the increasing of the price of the train and the price of tickets in this last ten years. But, you can tell, that in the industry are trying to change this problem, not by trying to reduce the car industry, but by trying to find a new way not to pollutethe planet, like by biocarburant. Furthermore, It's nearly impossible to avoid people using their car, like for working people, or people living far away. And in addition, today, having a car, is also to be part of the social world, to be autonomous. However, You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear. When you see the fast evolution of all the other ways to be driven. Furthermore, lots of people prefer public transport as a cheaper way to go to work, and governments understand this and are developing this, like in hong kong, where you can do everything without anycar, or in London, where the city doesn't allowany car. Or even in strasbourg where the french government make cheaper tickets in order to encourage people to let their car at home. In addition, we can not plan clearly in which way the world will evolve. If you take as an example a developed country, because it's the one who will be more affected by this matter, you can already tell how they already try to develop other ways to move in and outside of their country. Take as an example, the train development and the decrease in the price in some companies helped by government. In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of cars on the road in twenty years, in my opinion, I can say I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road, this due to the evolution of the population.","But with the news technologies, the bad effects of this on the environment and as a bigger scale on the planet, can be reduced, which is a good point, and as a matter of fact that the petrol resources in the world became really rare, which can be a real turn in the car industry, I hope in a good way.",0

I think CO2 is the most famous cause of destroying the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how convenient a car is. If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can't do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries. I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too.

At that time there were two famous companies called MACANTOSHI & APPLE(well later they united though). He tried to learn computers because it was very interesting. later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself.

Everyone has a community to live in ,but do not give it enough time to help. What is your community like? Your community is representing you. If you do not give your community a time to help you, you do not even help yourself. You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community, your community will develop so you will develop and you will think better to have a very good and connected community. Why do young people not give their community enough time to help. I think that they do not think of this or this thing or even do not come to their mind. For example my cousin works very hard to get a very high salary and to have a very comfortable life and to get his family happy with what he has done but he did not think that he could get his community time to help. maybe if he thinks they will help and this is why young people do not give their communities time they want someone to tell them because they only think of what they have and what they will have and ignore their communities.",Communities are the more important thing or the first thing in young people's lives than other things because you are growing and starting your life with helping from your community and you must try to give time to helping your communities.,0

I support this statement by giving reasons and examples in the following paragraphs. firstly,students should understand ideas and concepts because it makes them understand clearly and accurately. Understanding ideas and concepts of a particular topic makes their work fast and perfectly. For example suppose a student wants to give a seminar on the topic of spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and thoroughly.

473771.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that both of these options are very important for a student. Of course, it depends on what is your field of study. For this reason I would say that I disagree with this statement. For example if you are studyinghistory, it is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of course this is also a very important knowledge that is required ofyou, as a historian , to have. It is really very important, infact a student is studying for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what you are studying but I can't say that this is more important than learning facts, because without knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something. I'm thinking about when I was studying mathematics : for me and also because the teacher was very important that we, as students, understood the ideas and concepts behind an algebraic formulation, but of course you need to know very well also the formulation itself.","An other reason why I disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text books, you can't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you don't remember the facts: I'm thinking at some friends of me that they study something and after a few hours you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink, except'm the main ideas.",0

To sell a product, it has to have good promotion, advertisements sell the product because while showing the promotion of the product, the y are showing the best product ever, when sometimes it's just a big lie and sometimes it's the truth. The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in.","It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market.",0
997307.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"When I was a little boy, I always thought about "" Why does Uncle Can look sad? "". It was the times that I tried to create new thoughts in my mind and tried to find out why we happened to be alive. Uncle Can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind. I tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic -like I said, I was a little boy then- , which i solved lots of times. However it did not matter how many times I had solved his problems. It just made him create more. Then I understood that it is not just the ""things in his mind"", but there is something more which is socially structured by human beings and our culture. As time goes by, we grow up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society, which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people. When we are talking about society, we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structured situations. In this example that I will give, one may see things more clearly. When I was at elementary school, I just had to pass my courses, then I attended high school, now I had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university. Now I am studying at Bogazici University which is really famous in Turkey. However my missions continue to increase and advance while I am succeeding and going on. This may seem like a story of one. However that is not the truth. The truth is as a human being who grew up, he/she will have more responsibilities which makes us more stressed than yesterday. Why do you think old people love to look at old pictures? It is obvious that he/she wants to be like in the old days, the old days when he/she did not have any responsibilities. It may seem like only constructed society is to be blamed. However that constructor is us. Human beings create society and society creates human beings. We cannot really separate them.","Human beings are well known as progresive and ambitious and that is why we are always trying to better and more powerful, that makes us stressed and unable to enjoy life day by day.",0

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good.","Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world.",0

1611251.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is more important for a student to understand concepts and ideas than to learn facts by hearing. This is for some simple reasons. It might be better for a student to learn facts, dates and results because that is what the teacher asks for. But in real life, this means life after school, the time you need to work for your money to survive, it is better to understand things. A person not able to understand what she or he is doing is not able to develop an idea to find mistakes and eliminate them. A person who is able to do this would be much more successful in her/his job, just because of being able to make the way of working more effective. In school this kind of understanding and finding solutions to problems should be taught. Another reason why a theme should be understood is because of fun. Fun motivates us to go on, to do more. For some people it might be perfect to learn by heart, but most of them get bored.","The more effective way is to support the wishes of people to understand (who do not know the most frequently asked question of a child:""Why?

1088494.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertising has always been an interesting discussion topic for people. some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders. on the other hand, there are also some people who think that advertising really has alot to do. and I think, I would be counted in the second group. Advertising may make anything better by a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be the fascination towards the product. and looks matter alot. for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you. isn't it? that is where advertising comes into the picture. Its magic of advertising. Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. as we all know, that anything in this world is not perfect. All things have dark sides too. So, with a little help from advertising, we can highlight the positive points of some products and can hide the negative parts. for instance, lets take the example of cold drinks like, cola, pepsi etc. these drinks are so popular among people. but the question is why are they? while we know that these drinks are not good for your health. even then they do a great deal of business all over the world. The credit of this should go to the advertising. advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular. Nowadays, even some schools are providing training in how to do advertising. these schools consider advertising as an art.",and we all know what art is for.,0
1547480.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with this statement because I think that sometimes most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The advertisement is made generally to achieve the customer attention because in this way there is more possibility that the customer will buy the product. There are some people that study for a lot of years to learn the rules of marketing and to learn the right ways to achieve their customers. Today, on television, we can see a lot of beautiful advertisements. We are often interested and enjoied by them, but when we buy these products in a supermarket, we are often not so happy with our purchase. I think that often the advertisements that I see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention.","For example next week I saw the advertisement forBarilla, a famous firm that produces some types of pasta, and I thought that this was a little film.",0
644077.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Many people complain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion this is true because this is the way companies use to incite people to buy their product, and this is how people can only find out about new products. First of all, when a company makes an advertisement for its product, it wants to make sure that the product looks perfect on the eyes of the consumer. For example, if the company makes different types of products,it will make the advertisement of the perfect one. Companies can't show their weakness for their own products because there will be no one who will buy them. Second, advertising is the only way that people will know about a new product. For example, when the company wants to send a new product onto the market ,it uses advertising. Apparently the company wants to incite people to buy its product that is why it will make it unbelievable in the advertisement in order to make people think that this product is so good. From this you can understand that most of the time the presentation of many products in advertisements is really different from how they really are.",The companies are so clever when they make these advertisements because they want to incite people.,0

In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help.

150180.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There is a big difference between the concept of having extra information about one academic topic in terms of having enough information and knowledge about more than one academic subject. According to me I prefer to have extra information about one topic instead of having knowledge about more than one topic. For some reasons such as ; being happy or earning more money. First of all; Having extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist in this area. it is such an important feature of making your job good. If you improve yourself really extraordinarily in a specific subject, it also brings you success and power. For instance; you are a doctor and you are really successful in your job. Everyone can know you because of your ability to achieve goals, as a result you will be a person who is unique in your area. Also this success could bring you happiness and money at the same time. You will be happy because you are doing your job well and people are admiring you for your high ability in this subject. For example you are the doctor who will find a solution to the cancer. Because you are just focused on this topic and there is nothing to prevent your success. At the same time speciality will bring youmoney. They are all related things. For instance again; if you are a doctor and you are doing your job and everyone knows you, it means that you will have lots of patients and you will gain much more money.",on the other hand; you are a doctor but at the same time you want to be an engineer or historian.,0
1172673.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""Young people are strong and dynamic"" These words are proved by great scholars and philosophers of our country. I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands. Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs. they feel experimenting with them is an enjoyment. But those r not really enjoyable things in fact which apoil the carrier of the youngster. those kinds of enjoyment are restricted and enjoyment should be done so that he has a good time and good memories which he can share with his young generation. Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more ability to enjoy themselves. Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment.

Today the situation is not good for the big presence of cars and science and gadgets must do something to solve this problem and to limit the damage that these cars' presence does to the environment. Twenty years ago there were fewer cars: this is a sign of our economic and technological improvement but this improvement has caused us a lot of problems that were unthought years ago. The biggest problem is the pollution of the air that we breathe because of cars' gases. This problem has brought water pollution too and provoked the birth of a lot of new illnesses that didn't exist years ago. So I hope that in future the number of cars will decrease to have less pollution and to have a good environment. Another solution could be found in some improvement in science to eliminate the pollution caused by cars. Another negative aspect of the high number of cars is that, especially in the cities, every day, there are a lot of cars that crowd it and cause problems for the traffic. So a decrease in the number of cars should give more peace to cities and should be easier for people going from one part to another of a city. A solution in this case must be found by governments that should decrease the cars into cities improving public transport. If the network of public transport is well organised, I think that people would be stimulated to use it and to leave cars at home and so wouldn't be so important having two or three cars per family.","So, in conclusion I think that with a small improvement in science and of gauge 's control will be fewer cars in use than there are now, and I hope that this will happen so we can live in health and in peace as life was twenty years ago.",0
1959261.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits. I have more positive experiences of travelling with a group than travelling alone. So i like to travel with groups led by a tour guide. Travel with a group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensive. Usually for group travel , one will take care of the ticketbooking, hotel reservation etc. The group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay. So i don't need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress. Last year,I visited India with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free. My group leader organized travel and reservations and my tour guide took me to all the important places. The guide will take the group and show everything that the group needs to see in that area. In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for the next day's events. This is so time saving.

697946.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Here are my reasons. First, the time of young people is not always enough. As a result of wealth, almost every student can study in schools, so they all have an opportunity to make friends with peers in schools. Hence, in their leisure time, they always have dates with their friends. In addition, the competition among young people is great, All students have to not only go to school but also go to cram schools to prepare for exams. Therefore, it is almost possible for them to have time to help other people. Second, all people, not only young people, all become colder and colder. For instance, I have seen a young man just sit on his seat near a standing pregnant woman without helping her. If we don't help a person who is just surrounding us, how can we help our communities possibly? In addition, our education always teaches us to study hard to get a famous college and compete with others. Therefore, we are not friendly with others because everyone is possible to be our enemy. So, we become never kind to others from our hearts. Third, we are always unfamiliar with our neighbours. Because everyone is busy searching for his wealthy life, he has to work hard to get high salaries or study hard to prepare to find a good job. We never have time to drink a cup of coffee with our neighbors. In addition, we all live in flats, so it is very hard for us to meet the people in the community.","To sum up, above s.",0

Maybe learning facts is important for students. But I think if they understand ideas and concepts, they will get facts, too. I think understanding ideas and concepts is easier to understand, instead of just learning facts. When I study biology, and history in English, my tutor always gives me examples, and ideas. And it is always helpful to me, and I will never forget about it. For foreign language students, the ideas and examples are helpful. Because they could not understand English well as Americans do, they could not just learn facts from books. So, the ideas or concepts are very important to them to learn facts. To understand ideas and concepts is more fun to do. If students get ideas, concepts, and examples from the picture, they can understand more clearly. To draw pictures or diagrams, students will have fun in the class. It is like a laboratory in the biology class. The laboratory exercise is so much fun, and students can get their main ideas of what they are studying. I think the statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. ""It is true.","If teachers and students can learn lessons together, and if the lessons are fun, students would like to go to school and they would like to learn in the school.",0

However some peoplen'tdon't. They hold the opinion that successful people would try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages. From my personal perspective, i would prefer the second opinion. first of all, doing what they already know how to do well is safer to get success, however, it may also make you lose something that may even more important. Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you only do what you already know at your times, you may fall behind the times. So its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages. the most valuable benefit of my opinion is that trying new things and taking risks may lead you to get more experience in the changing world, you may never lose any information. And that is what the first opinion would never achieve. What's more the advantages of my opinion are bigger than its disadvantages. So many people would think there are too many risks when trying new things and it may lead you to lose more. However, the more risks you get, the bigger seed you receive and that is the difference between successful people and normal people. But successful people are not those taking risks blindly, they think several times about whether they should do it or not until it is possible for them to do it.","After understanding, the reasoning above, it is quite safe now to say,.",0

Then, it seems that this tendency contradicts the idea of an "" enlightened "" human being, an ideology that has led our conception of education for ages now. So is the general culture required to live in our modern world or has become optional, not to mention archaic? Nowadays, globalisation that is to say,for a part of it, the spreading of the consumers' society model all over the world, makes specializationcompulsory. Indeed, the development of the new technologies of information and communication creates new jobs which need a specific formation (for example the hotlines and other services on the web). Moreover modern societies have created a need for efficiency at any cost, and only a specialisation can make it possible. However, a general culture remains essential for our proper liberty. Indeed a society which has led to a total specialisation has taken the first step towards the creation of a totalitarian regime. In this society citizens risk becoming machinas as the book 1984 written by george orwell shows.

It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days.

Of course; young people enjoy life more than older people for several reasons. First; I can say that young people have more free time than old people. Therefore ; this means that they have more time to spend on their hobbies and favorite sports. They have a chance to do whatever they want whenever they want to, such as leisure activities. For example; young people dont have to take care of children , clean the home and cook for dinner. However; older people have to spend some time on all of these things. Second; having a joyful time in life is more related to age. Young people have more energy than older people. They are more energetic and physically active as compared to older people. This enables young people to get more enjoyment from life. They can go to mountains for climbing , go for skiing and go for diving. However; older people may not do all these activities since they may not be able to find enough energy to do them. Therefore; this makes them not get much joy from life. Finally ; it is more related to the psychology of people. Since young people have much more curiosity than older people ; they have an eagerness to discover new things. Young people try to get as much info as they can get from their environment. Therefore; they have much more tendency to enjoy life most. In contrast; older people would not be in a mood to look for something new. Since they get a lot of experience from life, they may never find enough interest to already discovered issues.",All the above mentioned reasons indicate that life is something like for young people.,0
1237942.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people, while others think that older people enjoy life more than younger people. I think that young people enjoy life more than older people because they have a lot of time to do whatever they want and also they are not married. I think that young people can enjoy life more than older people because young people have a lot of time to do everything. Also I think that because young people enjoy life doing the things that they like, such as, skating, snowboarding and surfing. Also I think that young people enjoy life because they always do the things that old peoplen't don't want to do. Moreover, young people have a lot of energy to do everything, one thing that old people don't have because they felt tired of that. However, I think that one kind of old people can enjoy life more than younger people, that is the old people that have a lot of money and are a little bit crazy. I think that kind of old people can enjoy life more or more like younger people because they have a lot of money to do everything that they want, so they don't care about spending money. But for all the others that don't have a lot of money, I think that young people enjoy life more because they are not married, so that means that they don't have any responsibility because they are alone.","I think that young people enjoy life more than older people because they have a lot of time, a lot of energy and also they can do whatever they want because they are not married, so that's means that young people are free to do everything in their lives.",0
236714.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"My teacher always gives us facts and information. It's difficult to learn and understand. Once, i asked him about his way of teaching and i gave him my opinion about explaining the ideas to understand them. He thanked me and changed his teaching methods. I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts. My reasons are listed below. First of all, understanding ideas helps students to expand their knowledge. If the student gets only the facts without understanding, he will forget this fact fast with any useful. A human has a brain to think and understand facts not just to learn them. Moreover, we must give the student a chance to reach the creative level. Using the brain and understanding ideas, the student is eager to create something new.","If he understood how TV was invented, he would think about inventing something new.",0

1315961.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do not agree with this statement because younger and older people have different ways to enjoy life. Life is not about age whether it is a young person or an older person, but instead about the symbolism of joy is a way of enlightening and bringing happiness. Younger people might think or have the idea that they are the only ones to enjoy life, but at what cost. Older people have the treasure of wisdom among knowledge, with a conviction of lots of experience, they have the mature and most important quality, patience. I have seen older people enjoying life more then younger people, but also, comes to a cost of good health. I have seen many older people that enjoy life as if they have the hearth of a twenty year old person. To me, life enjoyment is a long term learning experience that brings individuals to understand the meaning of enjoyment of life.","When one is young, one can think that they have the energy to impose them selves on the world that they are indestructible and this might bring to a short end of life.",0
1258000.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Well i think it ` s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first question is, what are old people, and what are young people? It mainly depends on the person. Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and elderly people are about 60 years old. In this case, young people have other interests than elderly people have. For example, young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music, whereas elderly people are enjoying a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the background. But i have to mention, that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music. For example the generation who grows up with Rolling Stones or AC DC still go to their concerts. The only difference is, that young people are normally in better shape than elderly people are. The older you are the more problems you are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can do more sports.",Elderly people have to care more about themselves.,0
1123424.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work. are shown. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you would rather pay attention to the person or musician announcing the item than the announced item itself. Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportsmen or sportwomen are used in the ads. To sum up, I do not believe what is shown in the ads. since they make the products more attractive than they really are.",Ads.,0

1408795.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The world changes very fast. People change with the world and they have to adapt to society in the best way. Young people nowadays have different tasks to do from the people who were young in the past. Today life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different to those 20 years ago. A young person has to go to college or university, maybe he has to work if he wants to pay for his studies or other activities. The free time is not a lot, so when a student is free, he usually goes out with his friends and to think about enjoying activities like going to a disco or listening to music. Someone might think that it is selfish but I am sure that a young person must have a leisuretime. However the time can be spent for the communities. It's quite true that a lot of young people don't like helping their communities.",The young people nowadays are not all lazy.,0
1569573.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination. of course every idea can be based onfacts. but sometimes it's wrong because students have to try to think of things someyears ago. many schools force students to study with formulas and memorize only facts. they didn't allow students to speak their opinions freely. but these days, many systems have changed in school. they encourage students' creative activity. when childhood is important to students they don't know much about society and the future and around many things. Free thinking can be helpful in our society. these thinking can produce a more advanced future. just to learn the facts and memorize them block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can. for example , i read the book a few days ago after reading the book i agreed with it. the book includes information about French education. the children learn mathematics in school they have to solve the problem but they can't count the number well. when they learned mathematics they were focussed on remembering the formula and they always studied the same questions. sometimes they faced higher problems but they also depended on the formula. so, oneday their homeroom teacher asked them ""which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2? ""children answered ""1/4"" they knew only a bigger number. they couldn't think about the amount and range and degree. so i suggest that they should be learnd with new ways like experiments and express their thinking,even if it's wrong. another one is about art. art includes alot of things.",such as drawing and taking a picture and acting and so on.,0
788567.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"TAKING RISKS Most people are afraid to take risks in their lives. They prefer to live in safety. That's why they do not want to change their conditions. But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves. There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some people think that they are only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. Through these experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his internship. He worked as a worker in a building. During his internship, he experienced and learnt how he could build a strong building. Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well. Good productions bring success. For these people should know how to do and improve it.","In this way, they do not need to take risks or experience new things, because they can maintain this from books.",0
18690.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting. A specialist is the man who soeciallyizes in more than one subject.",The famous English detectives in the novels are good at detective and music.,0
1054917.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject. Before applying students should take the following aspects into consideration. Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you have received the job you can still and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for. Secondly, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extent there is some truth in it, but, undoubtedly, experience shows that no matter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same. Nevertheless, doing a generalistical degree is in my opinion, better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time. In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only bespecified. And the time you have spent remains the same.","To summarize, students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they have obtained a degree in a specific subject.",0
836337.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In general I think that both understanding conceps and learning facts are the two faces of the same medal. I will try to explain here below all the connections between concepts and facts especially in science terms. All the big scientific discoveries depend on the observation of facts, but on the other hand it is important to know all the theories related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of the facts we are observing. To give an order to this matter I think that first (in a temporary order, not for its importance) students need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts, so in the first part of students' formation it is necessary for them to learn as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the matter and after they can understand and remember much more easily all facts connected with their studies. for example if you are studying the atomic structure, of course you need to know everything about chemistry and related theories.","This example feats quite well to this essay, especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission.",0
532892.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","It is generally believed that after twenty years, there will be fewer cars than today. Although many people think that cars are getting more decreased, in my opinion, cars will be much more increased in twenty years. Above all, nowadays people want to live more conveniently. people would like to save time and money. so they may want to own their own cars. For example,if they have their cars, they will save time and they can go everywhere they want. Cars will become the most important things in people's lives. Then the demand for buying a car will be increasing. For example, nowadays one house has more than one car. Because they want to move individually, so they just get one's car. In this sense, people need cars imperatively to live more conveniently in an individualized society. In addition, recently our technologies have developed continuously. All over the world , they try to create new and innovative things. then we cannot stop their needs for making good and new things such as robots, machines and cars. some scientists try to spread out the car which makes no pollution or uses natural resources.","If we have those cars, we do not worry about the pollution which can have bad effects oncars.",0
136109.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth. It's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products. But sometimes,the products really disappoint clients. For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it. But only after some days,I found the shoes hadn't got a good texture and were destroyed by walking. Then from these advertisements,I take a lesson:Don't believe adversisements! When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive,it means in other aspects,maybe they are controversial. When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not. Watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of the world. And some advertisements are too artistic or dramatic, which attract people very much. Like microsoft's advertisements for pentium 4. They tell us a new generation of computers,Though high- technology such as computers,mobile phones, mp 3s are improving very quickly. But they are the fashion. And for me,I think high-technology and make-up things are toys. They are changeable like the toys I played with during my childhood. And they can be discussion topics. It makes us more interesting. Though their prices are not reasonable. Afterwards,though the advertisements always give us products not as good as they claim. But as daily information,we can't get away from them.","In a global world today,we also get benefits from advertisements.",0

1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily.","Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it.",0

Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do.

1513527.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time.",They think it is more useful than in communities.,0

As more and more cars are rapidly produced today, the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportation throughout a nation. The space allocated for the vehicles will soon not be enough. Population growth directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road. Highways of hundreds of metres tall will anyway be fully congested with drivers.

Nowadays, governments are doing their best to limit the number of cars, scientists are trying their best to invent new kinds of traffic tools and the public have begun to know the importance of protecting the environment. Therefore I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years. First, governments should ask for higher taxes for buying cars, and this will make fewer people have the eagerness to have a car. Providing more public transport tools is necessary for governments as well. In addition, convenient traffic lines and fine road conditions are also important elements. Imagine that one can get his goal place quickly and conveniently by a kind of public traffic tool, who else would like to have his own car with a high price of oil and high tax? Scientists have something to do as well, however, they are trying hard now. In the next 20 years, scientists are supposed to invent more kinds of traffic tools.

378701.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yes i agree with the statement, it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts of a particular thing. Because it is more important for any one to have a clear idea about that particular thing to work on it. I would explain with an example,when i am doing my first semester of my undergraduate studies i usually do my assignments with out understanding them and with out any clear idea about the topic given. i used to submit my assignments in this way only. when my examination is nearing,i dont have any idea about the topics because i didn't work on them clearly.

This can be supported by various factors that are usually common in day-today life. The first factor that is also an important factor would be health. Many people who are old may face many health related problems that an average adult may not face. So, because adults are stronger than older people health wise, they are more likely to enjoy life. Younger people can participate in various activities that older people may not do. For example, adults can enjoy travelling to various places and like to do various activities like: skiing, hiking a mountain, surfing in the ocean etc, which older people can probably not do.

There should be an energy when young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the environment they live in. It is sad that people can't see young people attending the activities of their communities. The reasons that cause this situation are competition, education and value. First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate in any activities. There is more stress on their shoulders, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and perform well in school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes. They have to sacrifice their playing time to achieve their goal. They try to get into a public university because the tuition is higher than before. There are many people who may not afford it. What a stress on them and it makes young people ca' t help their communities. Second, there is something wrong with education. Young people didn't get the right messages from education.

For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues.","For instance, you own a shop.",0

1048805.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I can not agree with the statement which is that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I actually think the statement is the opposite, which is that older people have enjoyed life more than young people have in recent years. In my country, Japan, there are many young people who do not do anything; they are staying at home and they do not go to school, do not go to work, or do not do part-time jobs ; they do not want to do anything, or they do not know what they want to do. Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in. And many older people have worked for a long time in some office or in their home as housewives. So, they want to use the time for themselves this time.","They know how to use the time moreover, they have desired if they quit jobs, they want to go hiking or traveling, spend their time doing their hobbies.",0
1192415.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, for two reasons.

I joined an interview process and new hired people training at my company.","In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position.",0
1728651.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I love my car and can`t give up using it and I don ` t agree with the statement that says there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. I have three major reasons to say that. One of them is that newer types of car are being produced and the second is that transportation by car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that have to be made for people to transport The first reason for not agreeing with the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of car are being produced. These types include cars which work with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things. There are also plans to create cars which are flying near to the surface and this will provide a place for some more cars. The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars is very huge. There are other ways of transportation for example planes. They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople. Nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country advances. Cars are effective for transportation for many people The third reason for not agreeing with this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes. They should be very expensive changes, that are needed to compensate for the need for transportation of the increasing population of the world. Installing a new system is required and for this system many new research should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again. To conclude, as i stated in the reasons above there will be more cars than now in twenty years.",One of them is newer car types and the second one is the efficiency of cars and the expense of the changes.,0
1123014.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because,when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself. When a student has understood a certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself. By understanding it the student will be able to answer any type of question on that topic.

161171.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"People can choose between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject. Some people prefer studying broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learning the academic subject of one specific subject provides narrow knowledge for people. However, I strongly prefer studying the academic subject of one specific academic subject because it strengthens people's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledge in one specific subject. First of all, I prefer specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learning environments. Learning many academic subjects needs a lot of time. Moreover, if some academic subjects are not interesting to people, then the environment discourages people's studying ability For example, according to a study by one of the most famous professors Dr. Kim, Republic of Korea, 68. 9% of people like learning one exciting academic subject because it makes people's good studying circumstances. In this sense, I would rather specialize in one specific subject because it strengthens people's exciting studying circumstances. In addition, I would rather study the academic subject of one specific subject because my future occupation needs professional knowledge.","Our special occupation in the future is generally only one such as teacher, nurse and doctor.",0
127102.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"While we are studying it is good to know what I should learn. Should I keep working on a subject that I already master or should I develop a wildspread culture ? On the one hand, I could specialize in order to become one of the best at what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another subject, while on the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill. A lot of scientific development wouldn't have happened if scientists just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improved the way he viewed physics, he wouldn't have been able to develop his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics. Usually great intellectuals have a broad knowledge that gives them a new way of seeing their specific subject. So in many ways both assertions are complementary. Personally I am a very curious person. For me all knowledge is good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity. Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I can only understand. For this reason I believe that it is ""better"" to have broad knowledge. It is more social. However our social environment and our society enhance experts.","If you want to be hired by a company, whatever you are doing, you need to be good at it.",0

328055.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are. Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it. The thing for people to decide whether to buy or not is usually outside looking.",So people will complain about the products when they buy them.,0

However, it is difficult to spare time for a trip. In this situation, I would prepare the trip before going to travel. That's why I do not need a tour guide for sightseeing.

266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?.",He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life.,0
1012427.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this statement. No matter whether successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing. Successful people try new things and taking risks are the best thing that they need to do. For example, an animal professor who discovers medicine for humans.","If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have, so this is not called discovery and they are no longer needed.",0
999780.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Many people are trying to succeed in their career. Some of them fail, but others can achieve the goal. those people who became successful, used to work very hard but were very well skilled. When a person succeeds, then they are more likely to challenge themselves. Because they feel more satisfaction, they feel like they need to try themselves in a higher position and in a risky situation. When somebody has already succeeded in their normal life, they become proud of themselves. They feel happy and tend to have more self-confidence. That motivates the person to try something new and more successful things. They also could do everything that they would like to do if they have succeeded the most in their life. Then, that person, because he/she believes that everything will be fine, starts preparing to do new things. Even when something goes wrong, they believe that it could be solved quickly with their own experience and knowledge.",Those backgrounds before being successful people is another strength to keep them trying new things.,0
232900.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"there are a lot of responsibilities on the young people's shoulders. they are trying to discover themselves, discover their abilities, their place in the community eventually drawing their own path. I believe eventhough i spend most of my timestudying, i give time to helping my community. is it enough? I think this statement is both true and not true for different reasons. it is true in a way that we don't do our best. we can spend a lot more time making our city a better place. we can take part actively in activities. Also, we can spend more time with the elderly. we can do this by carefully planning our spare time. but usually we choose to relax and be with our friends when we have time. one of the reasons for this is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before. almost everything in our lives can be done with professionals. because of this people less interfere in each other's lives. on the other hand its true that we are doing whatwe can. even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the community. I do not have time but when I see my neighbours I ask them If they need anything. I live in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters. I ask them if they need anything when I am going to the market or for example. If something is going on in front of my eyes i do not close my eyes, i interfere and help. If I am not aware of what can i do about it? I think this sentence is both true and not true from different views. It is true that young people might be a little bit isolated from the community and because of this they are not helping much. but young  people, especially students are busy with studying and developing themselves and should not be worried about not giving enough time.",it is a communitarian responsibility to create the occasions for sharing and helping.,0
475475.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago.","To improve its condition, I attend this activity.",0

1011356.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do.",To be young is beautiful.,0

In this case the question is very limited, and regards only the complete or uncomplete people's knowledge background for their ownsuccess. In my opinion is impossible that people can achieve success only with knowledge , but in necessary a mix of the various elements that make it possible this; is more possible than one personn't that hasn't particular the ,, economics skills, one success than one very person skills without any skills in the economic world. But it is also true that knowledge consists in a principal help for the aim of success.","For the first successful people must tend to the risks, because without the risk can't have what you want; the risks are proportionated to the result that can be had if the new things that finish in a good result.",0

1994570.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes. Most people usually plan to travel across the country or overseas in their own life. They enjoy talking about diverse experiences where each person traveled. From my experience, I agree with the travel in a group led by a tour guide for some economical and exciting reasons. Firstly, I like to travel in groups led by a tour guide because I can save more money and time. A tour guide is professional enough to give us more information suited to the places that we want to travel to. In addition, a tour guide needs to compete with other agencies, and it tries to give more benefits to its clients. A tour guide also has a lot of experienced information about what I want to travel, so it is kind to consult her to give information. The more important reason for agreeing is that we enjoy much more than traveling with several people for themselves. We can have a chance to socialise with a lot of new people. If we travel around unfamiliar places alone, it is difficult to first talk about unfamiliar people. So it can be alone.","However, traveling in groups first is easy to talk about each other.",0
1624635.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I disagree with what the statement says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I have three different points of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually. First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan anything because the tour guide knows everything about what to do or where to go. It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group.","When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended.",0
1192415.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, for two reasons. Here are my reasons. First, if one person doesn't want to give enough time to help other people that means he is selfish. I joined an interview process and new hired people training at my company. In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help.","Once I worked for a local campaign , but I always helped people and did some volunteer work for a patient group.",0
1110281.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, people however their age, are selfish because of the values conveyed by modern society and capitalistvalues. Indeed, everybody thinks about themselves so young people have grown up in this atmosphere of ''me and myself''. Life goes fast and we want to pursue and achieve our plans because today everything is planned per advance and there is no time for civic behaviour. In addition, globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identificationproblem: which communities are for which people? Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fights between them. So, there is no unity in this world why would young people change this by helping who and with which means? Modern life makes young people very narcissistic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be useful. Some will help the oldest and disabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them. Others will come into an association to create a better life place for their community. Indeed some associations and organisations have social aims in which young people want to be involved. In my case, I really want to represent the Black in France because there is a lack of representation even in the media, fashion, intellectual and scientist work. So I went to the Boucle d' Ebenene association which promotes African and Caribean entrepreneurs even though I have my studies and different things to manage before to help them. To conclude, I agree with the fact that there is a lack of motivation among young people to involve themselves in social and civic activities to help their communities.","In fact, they seem to be over booked by stuff like school, work, friends, early childhood.",0

1042567.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"These days, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. yes i agree with this. because the main point is they have no interest in helping others. some young people are giving enough time to help their communities. because they are interested in that. but these days young people are interested in going to the cinema whereas to help others. they are spending more time and more money on the enjoyable entertainment. but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends have enough time to help my communities. we spend time doing that when we are free. So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society. The main idea is that we help the community,by seeing our younger friends or any one,they may try to help the community. so that this will be increased by seeing one another. Finally, it supports the community. the help for the community is the main idea of me. because now adays no one is preffering to help others. because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a little bit of selfishness. so that they cant help the community. the young people now a days prefer to enjoy themselves rather than to help the community. if young people help the community the community will become good. the helping nature of the people should grow from childhood only. because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also. if it does not grow it is impossible to help at a young age. the young people these days are very joyous people. so that they cant help the other people. young people nowadays do not help enough for the communities. because the work pressure on them is very high,and some young students have no time to help the communities because of their studies. these are the main reasons why young people are helping or not helping in the communities. Some young people may help by words not by money. i think the words are very helpful for the development of the community. so young people should help their communities when they have time. if every younger person does this the community will become good. and it is useful for future community development. In my opinion, young people are not helping their communities,if they decide to help their communities the community becomesgood.",and by seeing them the otheryounger may try to help others.,0

1530737.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow. One, from my personal experience, traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by yourself. Because the travel company which the guide is affiliated with always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights. In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took.","Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes.",0
543170.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price.","To conclude, because of inaccurate estimations and damaging by the price of products, we seem to buy products which are actually not as good as they expected.",0

In Italy he was a well known mozzarella producer, and once he established himself in Canada he began the same activity, with the same method, day after day, and now he is one of the richest men in the country, exporting his famous mozzarella throughout North America. Maybe nowadays in such a competitive market this kind of experience has become rare, because of globalization involving all the 5 continents that causes the rise of new competitors everywhere and because of the growth of multinational companies with uncountable capital. What is interesting is that in this statement' is that in our own life, fossilizing ourselves is a practice to avoy.","A new idea, a different vision of life, the market, and so on, can cause a sudden success in our work place, family, group of friends or even in our school, and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position in this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study, to find a job, to be competitive in a single word.",0
1457945.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Personally i completely agree with this statement. Not only do I think this statement is true, but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act. I'm sure that one of the most important guidelines to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful, first of all you have to spend a lot of it! All successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evolving their companies and buying or creating new ones. I also think that one of the most important things for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power! It really doesn't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached. keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives. I can pick up a very well known example of a person who has been really successful: Silvio Berlusconi. The intention is not to discuss his political ideas, but to examine the goals a person has reached. A man who has always lived following this principle. At the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developing new companies. Some of these are always in the field of media, but some are not, like the italian football team AC Milan which he bought 20 years ago. Another example can be seen in the american Bill Gates. Can you imagine if he had stopped creating and inventing computer software after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway.",Probably we would be less evoluted now.,0

As time is changing may be the automobile company will have new options for the buyers. I partially agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. because india is still a developing country. those who have developed successfully might have options. india has to raise its economy. there are people still staying on the foot path. according to me yes may be we wont be able to see small cars like santro,zen etc during that time The indian economy would definitely have raised people instead of using small cars would prefer to use big cars like benz or posh. nowa days we see an increasing rate of petrol and diesel use. people find it difficult to travel by autorishaws and cabs mainly because of heavy traffic and very important things the attitude of the driver makes it easy for them to have the habit of sayingno. but if one has his own conveyance he/she may travel easily. but yes as i said earlier, India will be developed in the near future. where there are possibilities of having one's own customized plane or other facility.","Nowadays, the price of airline tickets has gone down.",0
1830076.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I guess a lot of people had the same problem: You are reading an article about an impressive building (like the Pyramids) and you do not understand how it was built and how hot it was able to resist all the time. In case you understand the idea or concept of the building, you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings. In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind. In this essay I want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas. Firstly, you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea. In case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim. Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea. Secondly, you are able to improve the concept. If you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable. Just think of the Eiffel Tower which had for the first time an iron staircase.","People transferred this knowledge to other buildings and increased the size step by step! Lastly, by understanding the concept it is easier to keep in mind the facts.",0
758953.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"No, i disagree, that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject Specialization is highly preferred according to me because knowledge is like anocean. What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean,so it is impossible to pursue in many acedamics. The better way is to take a single subject. We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field.","He gets the skills of innovation , works hard ,and tries to concentrate on his subject.",0

I believe that I can state this position through presenting the career of some of my friends. Observing their works and characteristics, most of them are challengers, who always like to try different things from others and like to invent something new that no one has ever thought of. If they believe that one project that has been planned very well based on their planned strategy through their experiences and collaborations co-works, they are not afraid of taking risks of loosing their fonds. I have a friend that has been working for the health sector which specializes in HIV/AIDS for many years in the world. I would like to say that she is a sufficiently successful person, considerate in her profession and her economic status that can live on her own.","Still continuing working for the HIV/AIDS issue in the international organization, but she has currently started to organize one project with her friends, which is very new here in Panama.",0

810079.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yes , i do agree with the given statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. This can be explained with various examples. To begin with , the elderly people didnot enjoy many privileges. Society was not that developed. They had no clubs , the advanced techniques to communicate. If they existed , they were in the minimum numbers. Whereas , the generation of today , gets to enjoy life to a much better extent. They have clubs , pubs and various other hangouts to keep themselves alive all the time. Young people are free from various fears and responsibilities that come with age. Older people are much more prone to a lot of physical problems / diseases. Whereas , young people do not face these physical problems more often. This also gives them that youthful and 'always-up-for-party' attitude. This can also add up to prove that the statement is right saying young people enjoy life more than older people do. Moreover , the advancement in technology nowadays has made communication and interaction much easier than in the earlier times. This acts as a medium of interaction between two strangers and can often be a starter for a dating , later shaping it into a relationship. This can certainly add up to enjoyment. The older people in earlier times didnot enjoy such ease of communication. Another point which can be a reason for the given statement can be the generation gap. It can be quite difficult for older people to communicate or understand the problems faced by young people at times.",The older generation is still stuck with the old orthodox view point.,0
1147528.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Have you met a person who is knowledgeable? You might say in your heart. How creative and smart he is! But have you tried to be knowledgable like him? It is definitely not a sophisticated task if you know the benefits from being knowledgable. Indeed, if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you will be more successful in your personal life and in your practical career. First of all, just imagine yourself knowing a huge variety of knowledge. That in fact will make your personal life easier. it will also help you to face many problems in your daily life. As we all know, you may face many challenges in your life and without being broad knowledgeable you can not control all matters. In retrospect, I still remember my uncle who was very knowledgable. I was a big fan of his. I used to ask him. ""my uncle, what makes you successful in your life. ""He answered, "" learn and learn until that last moment of your life. That will make your future brighter. ""And I used his advice and from that time and started reading and reading. Now, I can see the huge difference in my mind and in my life.

528240.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ideas and concepts is one of the most important reasons for the education of young people. I strongly agree with this statement so that all the facts have an origin in an idea. In the first place, the importance of understanding our history and facts does not only depend on our knowledge of the facts, but also on the comprehension of why all of the things are and were happening in our world. World War II was the most cruel war that humankind has ever suffered as a result of millions of victims in both parts. Beyond these atrocities there were awful ideas about how to rule the world. Furthermore, I can see the reasons for bringing a country to the war as the United States did to that war.

1758784.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"First of all I want to say, what the question deals with. I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part.",You should know everything about this part.,0
1063116.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. First,only students have to learn facts,then they will understand ideas and concepts. Students have learnt facts by themselves that they would have a deep expression of what they have done. if we just let the students understand ideas and concepts,they might not really learn facts. To let the students understand ideas and concepts is a requirement,but to let the students learn facts is more important. Second,how does students understand ideas and concepts better than learn facts? For instance, we read a novel story,we know what it talks about,but sometimes we might mistakenly know what we have learnt about. On the other hand,if you have learnt facts. then it is easier for you to understand ideas and concepts more clearly. For students' studies,the main point is to learn facts no matter what kind of subjects. it is proved that it is always true. So, if you want to learn fast? learn facts! it will help you a lot. Last,as we know,learning facts is more difficult for students to understand ideas and concepts.","For most students, they always did the ideas and conveyed fist,then went on to research facts,at the end of it, they would spend lots of their time on it,and it did not deserve it.",0
1952060.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand the ideas and concepts. There are two reasons why I believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. First, if students don't know about the facts perfectly and only understand about its circumstances and ideas, they will not know what the truth is. This would make students confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood the concepts of. They could do well according to what they have understood about, but if it is wrong what they have understood, they will fail at the moment. The second reason why i believe learning facts is more important is the change of concepts and ideas about what they learned. The concepts and ideas about an objective could change as time goes on. In other words, even though they learned the right concepts and ideas when they were students, the concepts of an object can keep changing depending on the social environment, so what they know will not come true anymore. Third, understanding only concepts and ideas is less effective for making creative for the student.","If they understood the object's ideas already, they would believe that there is only the ideas for the object.",0
253215.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"During life there are different periods and ages which each of them improve wider differences. The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children. Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study. They are not afraid of troublesome things they feel that they can manage the whole world. They have not always been accepted in society for being problematic and for driving crazy at their parents. They are noisy people. In the end for adults used to be totallydifferent. They get enjoyment by other ways. Spend time with the family, go on a quiet vacation, read a good book, go to an orchestral concert, work at home, do the house work, are some of the activities which adults prefer to enjoy themselves. While the young people dance in a noisy disco they have a coffee with some old friends. I think that each individual enjoys it in the best way for him. It is no matter what we do for getting. The time is short. We must spend it being happy and making people happy. it is fun to do it.",The creation of good is the ca.,0
1598284.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts? By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information. Huge topics and their contents can be covered in a minimum of time. But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned it. If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they really know it and will not forget it as quickly as they would if they just learnt it without understanding. So both sides have their positive and negative arguments. The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand. Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not really understand or would you be better off with some information you can handle and understand? Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just too huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it. So one should not concentrate on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) and one should not just learn facts. You would not know what to do with them.","It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs that you have not learned, you are helpless.",0

I consider that successful people share this definition, in the sense, that people that do nt try new things, experiments, or adventures will suspend or shorten out their knowledge, converting them into not successful people and standard people. If you have that spirit of investigating, like in trying new ways of finding certain knowledge, you could consider yourself as a successful person. Another important thing, is that if you are scared of trying new experiments or new methods, that at first could seem rare or odd, you could never have the belief that you are going to succeed in life.","If you study history, you could find some examples of scientists like Gramman Bell, Franklin and Mark Twain, who took many risks in their investigation and tried hundreds of times their experiment, here they never settled up.",0

We live our lives to our fullest when we are young, leaving behind the worries and the intricacies of old age. So i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energetic, with young minds fresh from college, with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out. ""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better than younger people. But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world. The older people have minds that are worn out, by age , by time. Whereas a younger mind has a lot of ideas to offer. These are fresh brains, that have come right from college, filled with all sorts of new tools and the vigour to put those tools to action. And also there is no burden of a family to support. A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife, his children, his home. , this list can go endless.","Above all the dating of girls , gives you such  a divine feeling that can hardly be expressed by words.",0

In my opinion the answer to this question in a world that is changing all day is ""yes"", for the next reasons. First, this is a learning world. I mean, a lot of knowledge and information is produced everyday, so people who want to succeed have to be available to learn new things every day. Some researchers have found that people must change their major aor career once in their life. Second, in business there are a lot of stories where people that don't take a risk and take a chance, lose a lot of money.

969165.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The issue at hand is whether or not young people give enough time to helping their communities. This is an important topic because it relates to community development. In my opinion young people help their communities in many ways which certainly consumes their time. A main reason for this view is that young people often come out to help their communities in times of disaster. For example if an earthquake hits a particular area then youn ones come out in that area to collect the money from all over the world. They advertise it in the paper, on the internet, on TV and everywhere else possible.","Not only that, young people earn their salary to help their community.",0
697946.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Here are my reasons. First, the time of young people is not always enough. As a result of wealth, almost every student can study in schools, so they all have an opportunity to make friends with peers in schools. Hence, in their leisure time, they always have dates with their friends. In addition, the competition among young people is great, All students have to not only go to school but also go to cram schools to prepare for exams.","Therefore, it is almost possible for them to have time to help other people.",0

1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that.","Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold.",0

In the old days, education was one of the important needs people might consider. That is because of the great enthusiasm young people might have towards accomplishing their responsibilities. For example, the percentage of failure in senior-high school was 30% in the Middle East between 1989-2000. However, between 2001-2006 the probability of failure has been highly increased to 70%. This statistic tells us that young people nowadays do not have the potential to accomplish their responsibilities, in order to respond to it in several generations after them.

I agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in so many ways. I want to give some of the examples why i agree with this statement. The first reason that i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people is because young people have a lot more energy than older people. For enjoying life it is not necessary to havemoney , energy also requires a lot. For example travelling to different countries gives us so much enjoyment. For travelling to different countries money will not besufficient , a lot of energy is also required. But in older people they have less energy and they cannot travel such long journeys. In this way young people have more advantages over older people. Another reason that i agree with young people enjoying life more than older people is that younger people can get a lot of entertainment in so many ways which older people cannot enjoy. For example going to discos and watching late night movies and playing games. But older people are not interested in watching late night movies,going to discos and playing games.

161841.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics. Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. One of the reasons for students to clearly understand ideas and concepts is motivation. If students understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the importance of eating healthily. Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me an example of how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system. At that time I was able to learn how the heart works.",Finally understanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity.,0

So it depends on the childhood, the luck to go to school and more generally of your life. For a student it is a good and a current question to know if he must choose early a speciality or keep during a long time many different lectures, What is the better choice ? It is not certain that the best choice exists. Nevertheless to my mind the recent evolution permits me to think that broad knowledge is preferred. The first example which accredits the thesis of broad knowledge is better is a farmer lost in a desert area with his cows he must primary know how to take care ofthem. It is easy to believe that he does not need to have broad knowledge in another speciality, but it is a restricted view. In fact if he wants his business to stay prosperous he needs to know how to read and write, it permits buying and sailing some cows or otheranimals.

I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Successful people are open minded ,and they experience new things to improve their skills. First of all, successful people have wide horizons, and They have no limits. They try all types of new things so these new things make people achieve success in their life. For instance, Bill Gates is a successful person. He had broad horizons, and created microsoft. He had an idea to create an app in order to improve people's lives. His work in technology made people gain some extra time in their work. Secondly, people who like to experiment with new things achieve success in life. Successful people should have new ideas, and these new ideas lead people to experiment.",Experimenting with a new thing lets other things come out.,0
436072.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. In my opinion, if you understand the concept, you always have time to learn facts or dates. In children's education, for example, it's important to give them instruments to understand nature and society. I think it's not so important to fill them with dates and facts. Moreover, if a child understands a concept, he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life. If he learns a fact without understanding it, he will forget it in a month. For example, i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old, just because my teacher explained the meaning of them. I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explanation of them. If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it, the children have no sense and don't pay attention to it. The same is true in adult education. In the university of medicine, for example, it is much more important to understand how to visit a patient, than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body.",You always have time to take a book and learn it.,0
669229.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,According to me people only become successful when they try new things and take more risks. If a person continues to do the same thing that he is well known for then there are fewer chances that he can earn more profits than he is earning now. People like Bill gates or Ambani took risks and came to the position where they are now. I will take the example of my friend's father who used to sell toys on cycle. He used to get up early in the morning and come back late at night. One day he was offered a chance or you could say it was a risk. The risk was to invest some amount of money in a business. If the business works then he will become rich but if it does not then he will lose what ever money he has and become very poor. He took this risk and worked very hard for the business to earn profits. He started with a small amount of profits then he invested that profit again in the business and kept expanding his business. Today he is one of the richest people in our society. So now we atleast know one thing that without risk there are very few chances of becoming successful. My father is also very rich and has his own business but when i grow up i do not want to continue my father's business because i want to have a platform.,Im getting help from him which i do not want.,0
505064.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First,it is very dangerous if one travels alone. When we travel to a new place,we do not know a lot about it. We will have plenty of problems. For example ,we may get lost in the new place;we may not find the right place to have meals and sleep after the whole tiring day. The first day of our trip will be full of finding ,boring and tired. Also,because if we travelled in a group,we could make a lot of new friends. I like to be with other people. It will not make me feel frightened and alone. When one of us is in trouble during the trip,the others will help him,we stay together like a big family. Sometimes after an interesting trip,someone could find his true love. Finally, our travel will become more interesting if we travel in a group led by a tour guide. The tour guide knows a lot of facts about the place which we are travelling to. He will tell us the history of the great interest when we see it. On the last National Day, I had a short holiday in HangZhou, I traveled alone without a tour guide. I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had been marked on it. But I failed ,I almost could not find any of them. I have got lost on the street at last. Fortunately,the police were very friendly, and  they helped me to return to my hotel.",I think the best wu.,0

309113.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","First of all, let me ask you this question. Would you like more cars or not? Aren't you aware of the severe air pollution problem? Don't you get embarrassed when passing at a speed of 10km/h in crowded crowded area? In twenty years, fewer cars will be in use than now. Actually, i used to dream of these kinds of cases when I was involved in environmental friendly social services. Our goals were to advertise the air pollution of cars and encouraging people to use public transport. By that time, I sometimes had that feeling one day, cars should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly. Likewise, the place i'm living now Singapore is a very country which has succeeded in reducing the number of cars. The high taxes included in the purchase disgust the buyers' taste for getting a new car. Not only the tax included in the buying process but taxes such as ERP, those which are paid when cars are passing the city area, are having great success in making people use fewer cars. This morning, i read in the internet newspaper about a very special item; the Flying Car M-400. This car has been put on Ebay as an 'on sale' item and the price predicted was about 4000 millions US $. It also included that this kind of car will perhaps be more popular in about 20 years, and in the time 20 years pass, I think scientists and engineers will be able to find a new kind of sources as a replacement for fuel. Well, it's true that people have already started to use gas using cars or even cars with engines using oxygens. No one knows what will happen in 20 years.","But considering the current ways people think about pollution and the fact that science is still developing, i prefer voting my part to the one agreeing with the statement.",0
1988555.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with that statement. In the world, many successful people exist such as Bill Gates, Lee Gun-Hee who is Samsung's CEO. So then if they didn't try new things, can we live like this convenient life now? Of course not. The other example is a soccer player who is Ronaldo. If Ronaldo did not try new skills, could he become a world star and get the love of fans? These questions are based on my opinion that will be explained. Do you know the proverb that ""No pain, No gain""? It is the best sentence for me in my whole life. If Successful people don't want to take risks, it is freedom for them. But they can not get more fame or what they want. For example, Bill Gates became the richest person in the world. Because he makes Windows 95. So did he stop development? No, he is developing now such as Windows XP, Vista. The other example is BMW and Mercedes BENZ. They are the best automobile company in the world. If they sell their cars, those cars become the trend and symbol of wealth. But they don't stop development. They will make hybrid cars for the environment.",Nobody knows that hybrid cars will succeed.,0
1126329.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree, because the advertisement exaggerates the efficiency or quality of the product sounds like a salesman in the shop. The marketing in many brands is aggressive because it is because, they want to compete with others and then show how better the brand is than the others. An example of that is the Walt Disney Company Over the year we saw many commercial announcements ontelevision, theinternet, in movies and mailing letters, they bombarded us with these promotions over and over again but in some ways they sellit a ""dream may come true"" but it is not true when you decide to start a vacation at Walt Disney.

1134094.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status.","Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly.",0
735597.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life. Nowadays, schools are almost every where in the world, where people would try to get as much education as possible, so they can be the top person. Almost all modern schools teach many subjects to the students, such as Maths, science and history. However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better. Not only is information going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future. In order to get into a good company or create a good company. People do not need all the subjects to do this. The only thing is the strength you have over the others. For example, a good program writer's nesscery skill is to write programs. He/she does not need to know Zoology well to do so, so why should he/she bother studying it if society only needs one strong strength per person. Strong strength is what a good company is searching for. Furthermore, specializing in a subject for a student can also benefit society and the world. Inventions make the lives better for people, such as the internet search engine and medicine prolong lives. People should specialize in one subject in order to make a good invention to help the people.","Thus, specialized in one area does not only help individuals, but also helps society and other people.",0

Obviously, today we enjoy our lives more than the older generation, because we face a different time.

A young man always has a great interest in new things. They like to enjoy different life and are eager to get more amazing experiences.

Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail.","One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"".",0
1923351.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my view, success depends on the area where he is working t. So, i believe ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is true in some cases and it is not better in some other cases. Firstly, taking a sports man in to consideration he should adopt some new methods to improve his skills in his game rather than trying for some other games. so here the sports man is suggested to carry his carrier on the same field without going to other fields and taking risks. On the other hand ,let us see how success comes from new things. For example,white brothers invented aeroplanes as they were new to the world they were praised by the world. And later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplanes are not so much praised as the white brothers. This is because the basis and the idea is given by the white British and the others have just made some modifications. Those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extent that the white brothers got. the people who follow the procedure given by others may not get success as much as the people who give the basic idea. we should note that going for new things gives success but it may or may not be changing the field of interest.",In the software field they need to change their domain frequently to give their best outputs.,0

Therefore learning the concept and theory behind it is very important. Concepts will automatically show the facts in the future. For instance, if I want to learn a new language then I will first learn alphabets. I will learn them to pronounce and even to write. Pronouncing and writing a letter will introduce me to the facts of the language. How hard is it to learn? and how easy is it? Implementing the ideas practically will show you the facts and results. First we will learn what color will be produced when mixing it with the other color. For instance, we will learn in book yellow plus blue turns green. Now, in order to learn the facts of this idea we will do it practically and we will find it true. This is why it is important to have an idea before implementing it.

1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate.

1630850.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years from now, surely. Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem. Many countries are suffering from traffic jams. The government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jams. And one other problem as serious as the above is the environmental thing. Cars cause pollution in many ways, most seriously, the engine gas of cars makes the sky foggy and dirty. It causes contagious eye diseases, and respiratory problems. In addition, it promotes global warming which is making mankind very afraid. The carbon dioxide in the engine gas makes the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth. And then the water level rises and covers the available land of us. Maybe we will lose our whole earth to live on. If cars don't decrease, there will be a crisis of the entire human race. Moreover, the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now, and in about 40 years, there will be no oil to depend on. From the present point of view, we can't live without oil and gas. They are used to making fabrics, circulating plants and factories, and more and more.","If we use all of them driving acar, the thing will happen a lot sooner.",0
754426.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject. In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree. Anyway now I am a military officer and preparing to enter into post graduate school for public policy majors. I could say this route is paved way. If I had been diligent in learning many academic things when I was in high school, I could have found the right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself nowadays. Lastly, specializing early may make one be partial. As balanced nutrition is very important for toddlers, balanced learning for young people. If one goes into a specific thing too early, of course she knows very much about her subject but not about other things.","It can make her concentrate more on the specific, neglect more on all the rest.",0

Recent activities such as new programs which aim to encourage people to use their creativity in the projects. Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result. As in our immune system, our body will respond to the invading pathogens more powerfully in subsequent exposures than the first one.

One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law. One of my friends, Tanaka, is the best student studying economics and has a lot of knowledge of the bank system.

By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented java,we can't understand the features ofjava. we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts. facts can also Improve knowledge. By studying the facts like Independence we should know about the great leaders of our country ,and we should know about how they will work hard for Independence. History will tell about this. So learning the facts was Important. By studying the facts the children can learn about the honesty, reliability , and history of the country. Everyone should know about the history of the country. By learning the facts we can prevent wars like the second world war and the first world war. by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods, It was very interesting. last week some of the people found the Dwaraka under the sea, so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were Dwaraka in the past. By understanding the concepts and ideas we can Improve the knowledge of the subject and we can Improve our performance and profound knowledge in the subject. we can't understand concepts like polymorphism and abstraction while learning about the facts. All the students can understand by understanding the concepts and ideas of the subject. Concepts were very Important and Ideas were also Important.

For example, if you do not know the concept of ""evaporation"" how are you going to know the ""process of raining"" or maybe understand some chemical process that involves the concept of ""evaporation"".","Secondly, I agree that students must know every concept of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challenges without knowing the facts.",0
997336.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ideas and concepts came from the facts. I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims.","According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense.",0

653273.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Personally,I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. It is for the following reasons. First,young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people to survive. Second,young people are more self-centred than they used to be. In addition,young people do n ` t be educated to care about their communities. First,young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people to survive. Today,with the economy growing,people have to earn more money to meet their material desires. In order to make a good living,they spend lots of time learning skills. In contrast, in the past,young people had an easy life,they would have more time to care about other people. Second,young people are more self-centred than they used to be. Today,young people are spoiled. Their parents always provide them with a good life. They can easily get anything they want,so they don ` t appreciate the people who take care of them. Therefore,they are becoming more selfish.","For example,one of my friends was born and grew up in a wealthy family.",0
615689.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for several reasons. First of all, successful people are able to learn and realize various things in their life and then they get a lot of information and knowledge through trying new things. For example, a person trying new things and taking risks can prospect and see the different fields with his or her experience. On the contrary, a person not trying new things and taking risks can not prospect and see different fields and also he or she may be embarrassed or surprised by these circumstances because of no experience. In fact, only a few people having experience of new things and risk can be possible to know the skill,like ""how to do this dangerous position"" ,""how to manage some risk"" as ""the statistics of the management ability in the dangerous environment.

492113.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, the education systems are generally based on teaching ideas and concepts. The ideas of famous people and some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime. I think this system will not work in the near future. Because of technological advances, students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world. Thus, they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts. They will deal with the issues which they really exist. They will give more importance to the occurrences. I think it would be better when the students learn the facts, after that they can find the fundamental idea behind this fact and the students can both learn two issues by analyzing the facts. If this system is formed, the students begin to learn the issues by experiencing the living facts. The drawbavk of teaching the ideas and concepts is creating an abstract education for the students. The student may never encounter these ideas or concepts in their lifetime. However the facts are real and nobody can ignore and run away from these facts. All the students will be adults in near future and will face these facts. If they meet the facts in their school years, this experience enables them to cope with woes easily. Another essential benefit of teaching facts is improving the attention of the students. The examples of the real world will arouse their attention and I think they will want to participate in the debates about the occurrences. This system increases the efficiency of education, the other system is so boring in respect of this one.",Because the students only memorize the ideas and concepts.,0
821824.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"well, in my opinion it is important for students to learn the facts, rather than understanding the ideas and concepts. because in my view the facts of any situation or the subject itself are more important. the facts form the real basics of that particular situation or topic. and facts are more understanding and believable than having some kind of an idea or knowing the concept of the topic. for example if the student is working on a project related to the subject he is studying ,then it is always better for him to understand and learn the facts of that particular subject than just getting an idea about it. by learning the facts he could always produce more information or real work.

Firstly i want to say that older people can do any thing like young people like if they want to go to a party they can go. if they want to do dance at a party they can do. i had seen an old person at someone's party. these old age people dance like young people. he was so active. secondly , if young people thought that they were more active than old people. so they are wrong.",An old person can do anything like a marathon etc.,0

It is good for people's minds, solving many problems simultaneously. First of all, knowing many things is helpful to someone's life. From learning many academic subjects, we can broaden our knowledge and common sense. Also, we can meet many people who study other fields, and speak to each other.

1840823.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts where it could bring out the natural talents in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room. Understanding the ideas and concepts makes the childern think more scientifically and discover more new things about a particular concept it inculcates a habit in children to analyse things in a more broad way and arrive at the results on their own. Understanding things rather than learning things from facts from the class room helps the child to remember the things for longer and in inculcate new ideas in arriving at new ideas which help them in a long way to go. Also, learning concepts and ideas rather than learning facts which were written or told by some one helps to develop a desire for inviduality in the child and to evaluate the issues in a rather broad way standing different from others. For example one of my friends with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed an idea which he implemented in one of his projects and his project was selected to be demonstrated at NASA in the United states. and he was also rewarded by the president of my country as the best out standing research student in his age group.",Learning concepts and ideas would also children in their education where he could he could he could be interested in fields like research and things that really do matter a lot and even have lots of influence on his/her professional career.,0

As far as I am concerned, young people have more methods of enjoying life than old people. In the following paragraphs, I will reason and provide examples to support my opinion. Young people are full of energy, which means that besides their studies and work, they have much more energy to have fun. Young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and havefun. At night, the dancing bars are full of young people. They dance, talk to each other and drink together. During the holidays, young people drive to the mountains or the sea shore to hunt , canoe or hike. Because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work, they cannot spend as much time as young people on holiday travel. They normally stay at home and watch the TV or chat with their old friends. Young people have more new methods to enjoy life because their brains run faster than old people.","Because there is a lot of pressure from the job, young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged.",0

Studying facts has its advantages for students. For example, students can study a lot of things within a short time. Studying formulas is the best example. If we study how to solve problems by certain formulas, we could solve many problems especially Maths. However, I strongly agree with the statement. There are more advantages to studying concepts for students. The best example, which illustrate my point of view is studying science. When I was a child, my parents encouraged me to have curiousities. They made me think about why the rainbow is colourful and why the shapes of the moon are different, and so on. Then I tried to figure out the structure and elements of them by myself. Sometimes I went to the library to research and asked professional people.

345389.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When students study, they need to understand what they study, rather than learning the facts of it. Because, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful to understand problems much deeply, much easier to memorise, and much more acceptable for other problems that they have faced. first, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful for students to understand what they study better than facts. When students start to understand the idea and concept of certain questions, they will find what was the cause, and how it works. It's like grapes. All the teeth of guiers are matching perfectly the machine works. Therefore, to understand what they are studying deeply, then they need to understand what the idea of it is. Second, understanding of ideas and concepts will be in students' minds a longer time than learning facts. Because, there are lost of facts in all single questions. If students start to study facts, then they have to memorise all of the facts which is a bigger number than ideas and concepts. Lots of facts can be found in lots of similar type of questions However, those are similar questions, so if the students remember only one idea or concept, then they will be able to solve all of thequestions, instead of remembering all of the factors for each question. Therefore, understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts, so that will remain in students' brains for much longer. Third, ideas are much more appealing than facts when they have some other problems. When they understand the idea, they will follow on that idea and stick to lots of thinking and reach a much further idea and study more widely. However, the facts are too certain, narrow. Also it cannot be changed, like a stone.","None of the branches can stick on a stone, so students will know how to get a bird with the stone, but will not know how to play 'catch ball' with the stone.",0

439202.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"This is a controversial issue to define the important factor for students. Someone's priority knowledge of ideas and concepts that students gain is the most important factor in education However, others may say that experiences from facts are an important factor for students. These priorities would depend on everyone's previous life experience. In my case, I grew up in a school that gave me a mixed educational method,and that the method was equally balanced. Since I recognise mixed educational policy, both factors are key to obtaining better concepts, and at least I can say both factors were needed and just one of those would not bring a significant result. When I was an elementary school student, I learned the concept of insects. That was the first time that someone told me a concept. I was engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insects. This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant amount of knowledge even though I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insects. This experience made me realise the importance of understanding ideas brings me more knowledge. In contrast with this experience, I learned concept from fact that I faced an earthquake when I was 10 years old. At that time, I did not know what an earthquake was. First trembling came, and everybody went down stairs or desks to protect theirlife. Although I never knew such actions had to be done, I learned immediately and so did I. These actions kept me from potential damage by the earthquake. After the earthquake passed, my teacher gave us a concept. In this case, having to learn facts gave me a concrete concept and ideas of what an earthquake is.",I say both factors are equally influenced and valued for better education and each is more or less valuable for better education.,0

I support the statement because of the following considerations which i have taken into consideration. The first consideration is that man wants to enjoy comforts and is one of my major considerations. It is because the bikes cannot support the driver in all cases, that is in the rainy season. and the driver wants him which could help him to take him in any atmoshperic condition. this is the first time a person wants to have a car. And the second reason is that it would be safer than bikes because he can keep the temperature of his car according to his will and his comfort while the person riding a bike cannot. And the other reason I would support my statement is the cost of the car. The cost of cars has decreased now a days because of the growth in technology. Now a days, car makers are improving their technology so that the car will of least expenditure, so that there will be more people to buy their car.","If we compare the number of cars present 20 years ago and the cars present now we can see that the number of cars hasincreased , a wide variety of cars are now present on the market and also the features the car should have has also improved a lot.",0

1531692.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I prefer having a broad knowledge of different academic subjects that are specialized in one specific subject. Specializing in a specific field is not a weird decision, we can see in our daily lives that there are a lot of people that in the last year of degree decide to continue studying in a specific field of knowledge. However, from my own point of view and experience I prefer having a broad knowledge of different subjects , because this is translated into a person who is able to face different topics in a discussion or debate. First of all, I would like to explain my choice by arguing that in the future I would like to work in a business in which to do dynamic work. I mean, consultants, for instance, change the projects on which they are working every week, so they have to deal with different subjects, such as telecommunications, energy resources, the economy. That is what I like! ! ! However, as I said before, many people decide to specialize in a field. This is the case of professors at university. For example, in the faculty of Chemistry we can find different departments: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, thermodinamics. Professors have to specialize in a subject because they are dealing with the same aspects every day, and they need to know as much as possible about a certain field. The best of all would be to have a large knowledge of lots of subjects, but this is not possible today for human beings, because our brains can not retain so much information.","Even though, I have heard of people that have studied like 5 or 6 degrees.",0

In the present era most young people have become self centred and they are not in a mood to know about the problems of the world. they are always seeking their own comforts. for example consider that if robbers have entered the neighbour's house of a man and he comes to know that, first he is taking care of the valuables in his house rather than helping his neighbour. nowadays, young people are lacking in moral and ethical values. they have become worse than the birds. i. e. if a crow dies or is wounded then a large number of crows gather at that place and shout,but when it comes to people if a person is met with an accident on a road most of them pass as if they dont see that incident. They did not even call an ambulance. instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness. According to me this system has to change,each human should help others. One person has to help atleast three people in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person has to ask those three individually to help three others. now nine people have been benefited and these nine have to help three others each individually. Like this if the chain follows society will change and all human beings can live happily.",The conclusion is that man is a social animal.,0

Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job.

Today young people, with the conscience of this reality, think about the most effective ways to use their time. Money as the root of all evil pushes today ` s young people to research for the ways of self-masturbation but not the communities`. The most important fact that can not be denied is that humanity is in the middle of a technological transition. Among this transition, every new gadget attracts their attention. A new mp3 player, a new CPU with four chipsets or a new software that allows using the same desktop; they are stuck in the dream of what is going to come next. Because of this kind of innovation, they begin to think in micro instead of macro and they become isolated from their community. This isolation causes to become antisocial and ends by becoming self- centred. When they need help with their own problems, they just have to browse on some online forums and get the answer they need. However, this generalization would not be all accurate. There also exist some situations when young people help their communities such as teaching English language and computer utilization to homeless children, organizing visits to old people, cleaning the streets of the hood they live in, preparing theatrical sketches and concerts with the goal of a more computergathering. All in all, I do completely agree with the statement because young people nowadays are totally busy because of the obligation of self-improvement.

And transportation has also improved a lot compared to what it was years ago. Now, airplanes, underways, and ships are widely used in transportation. But if one says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. I strongly disagree with the view. First of all, cars are really convenient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short. It can drive from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday. No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above. For this reason, more and more people will buy cars on their own. Secondly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is an example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow. Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there was no transportation to there in the past. So with the demands of the families, there will be more cars on the roads in the future. More and more families would like to have cars at that time.

I argue that young people ought to pay more attention to the communities and be willing to spend time helping the communities. Therefore, I fully agree that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping their communities. Here are some reasons why. First of all, due to the flourishing media activities, the grand and big cities are undoubtedly fascinated by young people.

Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate.

And it is really boring to have the same routine your whole life, life is meaningless without trying new things as they can improve your life and make it better in many ways.","We could have stayed on mailing our friends from other countries around the world by using the mail, but it takes days for the receiver to get it, but a new technology was invented to mail your friends and keep in touch with them all the time, and this new technology is called the internet, which made the whole world like a small place where you can reach your friend and mail them all the time and they can also get the mail at the same time, the same day.",0
715539.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I personally agree with this statement. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy, it is true. But let me tell you this; Albert Einstein has a quote: ""Knowledge is power. ""which is completely true. Think of Biology without Chemistry; Chemistry without Physics; Physics without Geometry: Geometry without Maths and so on. A chemist cannot explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without Physics, can he? Or a Physics master cannot measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lights it, can he? Another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago. Take Pascal as an example. He has a lot of proven theories in Maths  and Physics. Isn't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored in and made himself known in? The answers to these questions I pointed out are simple and true: The laws of nature, the languages spoken, people and all the others that we know of are in only one place: here on earth. No one can prove that the facts about it aren't linked to one another. The links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end, you will end up finding yourself at the other. So, learning Physics, learning Chemistry, learning Literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about. You will find yourself on the other hand if you study hard and learn a lot. The only question is where to start the adventure.",But do not stick to the beginning because you will have a lot missing if you don't finish it until the end.,0
959233.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Does entertainment and taking pleasure in life depend on the people's age or not ? I believe that it is basically the character of the individual that the response lies on. It is true that with age, people have been loosing their physical activities, capacities especially in terms of participating in sporting activities. But enjoying life is not only limited by doing sport or showing the strength of your body. As we grow up' our intellectual capacity also improves. How about reading, playing bridge, doing hobbies like medicine? It all depends on the character, and also for minor factors his or her background (education ), the environment he or she lives in (his friendship) and financial means. If the person is positive about the world, life itself, I definitely believe that he or she will find the way to take pleasure in life according to his or her social-economic environment. This approach is always true when we are facing difficulties.","Is it an acceptable approach to leave everything aside and wait for death ? We, human beings are thinking creatures.",0
1279134.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"People learned a lot of kinds of knowledge in their schools. Education is a necessary point for all people to have a good life. There are many controversial topics about school and teaching methods. The statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts "" is also a big topic in education. I have studied since I was a child, and I have expenses of many kinds of teaching methods. From my experience, I agree with this idea I think that teachers can not teach everything, education gives us the ability to think. First, Teachers can not teach everything. In school, there are time limitations. It is impossible for students to learn everything in that school. For example, nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years. Do they know everything about nursing? I do not think so. Knowledge that students receive in the nursing college is just basic knowledge. In addition, knowledge is changed as research is done. In hospitals, nurses need to study nursing in depth in the critical area; nursing methods are changing everyday. Therefore, I think that teachers can not teach every fact in the school; students need to understand ideas and concepts. Lately, education gives us the ability to think: how to deal with a situation, how to solve that problem. If students only understood facts, they could not solve a different situation. However, If students know the concepts or ideas, they could use those concepts to fit the situations. In nursing, nurses care for a lot of kinds of patients: different age, gender, disease, race and culture. If nurses knew the concept of nursing care, they would change their nursing care to fit patients' conditions. If nurses did not understand the idea, they could not provide good nursing care, and patients would not have a good outcome. I think that facts show people one situation. Yet, ideas and concepts give us a lot of possibilities.","In education, teachers are not able to teach everything.",0

In fact, they can make products look much better than they really are. Therefore, they can make them look different sizes and more beautiful. First, tricking customers' eyes is a really good way to get more money. First, you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it look the desired to people. For example, I remember a TV show that was unbelievable to win a sports car if anyone answered the question shown on the screen. However, the question was so easy that I was going to call them. I saw alot of people calling them; in fact, the TV show got alot of money from the people calling it. A person won the sports car, finally, and he was so happy. However, the funny thing is that the car was a really small car. Actually, it was a kid's car toy. Therefore, they showed the car, and everyone thought that it was a real car with a real engine, but that tricked everybody even me. I think that this is a smart way of marketing products. Second, advertisements make the products look more nice and beautiful. In fact, they use professional and careful workers who can handle the product without making any mistakes that let the people notice any disadvantages of it. For instance, i saw a knife advertisement. The knife seemed so sharp. that was just because of the careful workers. however, when i tried the knife in my home i broke it.","In brief, advertisements make changes to the product size and make it more useful.",0

From the very beginning of life and also today way of doing this thing is advertising. Although the advertisement is a crucial thing, most of them make products seem much better than they are. First of all, the function of the advertisement is also to advertise the product i. d. it must give reasons to the consumers in order for them to buy that product. While they are doing this they are trying to pass their rivals, so they do unpleasant things to achieve their goals. So, the advertisements would give us some information about the product that is incorrect. However, what is next? Next time that consumer will not buy that item and that product has a bad image on the consumer. The consequences are not very clear in every situation i. d. that product would be a one-time buyable item in which the server of that product's aim is to sell it just once. But, this is also not a reasonable manner. Again, because of the reputation issues. In conclusion insist that an advertisement should not exaggeratethe product.

264742.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices. I have even come across a few parents who give their children the liberty to choose their career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects.","In conclusion, I would like to express disagreement with a person who possesses broad knowledge of many academic subjects.",0

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who like sports.

But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity.

1481375.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects. Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects, I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it. First, when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic, he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth. These issues are often complex, and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable. As a result, it is possible to take a position on debated issues. For instance, I have studied psychology for many years and in my country, different types of psychology are debated now. Having this deep knowledge in this particular field, I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion. Also I can stand in a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue. In addition, I think that if I know a subject very well, it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects. As everything is related, it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways. And I believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permits us to approach very complex issues better. For example, early this year, the government of my country wanted to introduce a law involving changes in the social system. Since I had experience in this field, it was easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker's point of view, but I also enjoyed getting very interested in other points of views as legal or economic points of view.",I was all the more interested by the subject that I feel very involved in.,0

Older people never had this great opportunity, nor the money for such a comfortable life. Second is the creation of a wide range of spare time activities. There are so many new possibilities for what one can do in leisure time, which did not exist in the time when the older people were young, and what they now cannot do any longer because of health problems. The variety goes from sports, culture, travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country. From this I want to move to the next point: foreign studies. Younger people don't even have the great opportunity to study, but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice. This is an important extraordinary experience, which has a great impact on later life. Living in a country for a period of time is something else than being on vacation.

People start to learn from when they are born. We have to learn language, ways of living, and many subjects in the school. I think the bigger knowledge is the better. It is good for people's minds, solving many problems simultaneously. First of all, knowing many things is helpful to someone's life. From learning many academic subjects, we can broaden our knowledge and common sense. Also, we can meet many people who study other fields, and speak to each other. Not only can we develop our social skills, but our thoughts are getting bigger. We can see other sides of society too. For example, there are many students who have a double major in my school. They can meet many students who have another major, and they know many professors. I think it is very helpful for students' futures. Furthermore, knowing many subjects, we can apply one thing to another. I think most subjects are related, and they have an influence on each other. If we know one subject accurately, it will help to understand other subjects. Hence, broad knowledge of many subjects is good for understanding many things. From my personal experience, when I was in high school, I solved many mathematics questions. From this process, I could also develop problem solving skills in society. I can use mathematical knowledge to solve real problems. To sum up, knowing many things has several advantages. It is good for a person's mind, also living in modern society.

The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us.

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world. As one man, if you have agood advertisement about your product, you will have agood idea around the world. Beacuse T.",V can show your advertisements to be good.,0
1988555.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with that statement. In the world, many successful people exist such as Bill Gates, Lee Gun-Hee who is Samsung's CEO. So then if they didn't try new things, can we live like this convenient life now? Of course not. The other example is a soccer player who is Ronaldo. If Ronaldo did not try new skills, could he become a world star and get the love of fans? These questions are based on my opinion that will be explained. Do you know the proverb that ""No pain, No gain""? It is the best sentence for me in my whole life. If Successful people don't want to take risks, it is freedom for them. But they can not get more fame or what they want. For example, Bill Gates became the richest person in the world. Because he makes Windows 95. So did he stop development? No, he is developing now such as Windows XP, Vista. The other example is BMW and Mercedes BENZ. They are the best automobile company in the world. If they sell their cars, those cars become the trend and symbol of wealth. But they don't stop development. They will make hybrid cars for the environment. Nobody knows that hybrid cars will succeed.","Although BMW and Mercedes BENZ may have taken risks, they did.",0
1728651.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I love my car and can`t give up using it and I don ` t agree with the statement that says there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. I have three major reasons to say that. One of them is that newer types of car are being produced and the second is that transportation by car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that have to be made for people to transport The first reason for not agreeing with the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of car are being produced. These types include cars which work with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things. There are also plans to create cars which are flying near to the surface and this will provide a place for some more cars. The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars is very huge. There are other ways of transportation for example planes.",They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople.,0

483612.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

There are many places in which young people enjoy themselves and older people can not.","For example, a game center is the place where we can play many games.",0
980298.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","A few years ago, the car was a really expansive thing to own by one person. It is because of payment of all the employees as well as their economic problems. In a few years, the materials which are used in cars were quite expensive and to make them they did not have machines to build these cars and they were making the cars by human beings' hand. In a few years, our world has got so many machines and their' improvements, cars are one of them as well. This helped to people to build up many mechanical things such as cars, buildings, computers or even children's activities. This also affected our relationships and the way we met new people that we never imagined, it did affect the children's world as well. Since those computer games or GameBoy came out, they have stopped going around their houses, stopped running and hanging out with their friends outside of their houses, instead of these things stopping, they started to play inside their houses and stayed in their rooms, did not come out from there and they became much weaker because of these computer games. However, because of those technological improvements, people have started to get cars for each person much easier than before. The cost of cars is getting lower and lower, and car companies try to make and sell them as cheaply as possible with lots of benefits.","So, I disagree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today but, ""the problems with it"" is we might finish all the oil we have now and we can not use cars in thefuture.",0
174491.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The notion of an advertisement is a modern phenomenon. Widespread trade and over production paved the way to a firmer competition in the selling business, and promoting a product became mandatory. The convention of the necessity of promotion among producers influenced the consumers as well. This leads to the production of effective advertisements that make the product look better. The media has a very strong influence on people's decisions. This power is so immense, one can even claim that people in the media are in the business of manufacturing will. Televisions are everywhere in the modern world. The effort to run away from televisions, radios or the internet is futile. Being exposed to the advertisements everywhere, changes the way we think. This happens at least in the subconscious level.",One can never forget a fancy advertisement.,0
957211.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"As always , people have been enjoying their life in their own way and value. I think this is true kept constantly for a long time and for good from now. Additionally, I believe that life is always a joyful thing wherever it is over time. First, If anything this is a delightful era unlike the period our parents got through the difficult time in the past. There are many activities and resources that old people can enjoy around us in this contemporary era. For example, we , recently can meet some movies focused on old people and it is a most remarkable change in our culture considering the fact that the movies usually belong to younger people. And we can also know that there are many active communities built by the old and for the old. These facilities , absolutely help them to enjoy their life. Secondly, I am compelled to emphasize the improvement and the development of the medical area. This big improvement achieved over time makes it possible that humans can live longer enjoying their lives when they become older. Personally, My father is 95 years old and my mother is also over ninety. Even though they are quite old. they go out to play golf and swim regularly. To tell the truth, I don't even need to show my parents' case. Probably , other people can also find old people who still enjoy active sports around them. I believe that all of these are possible due to the regular check up in the hospital and the assistant of cutting edged medical science.","Thirdly, Is it really true that young people enjoy life more ? Of course , I admit they are usually healthier and have a lot of energy which is obviously advantageous for enjoying life.",0
1659151.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"First, we have to identify what a successful person is. In a general way, it is somebody who realizes something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way. Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful? Is it necessary to show all those virtues to be successful? Is it the only condition to be successful? On the one hand, successful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful. So, it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful. On the other hand, somebody may have a lot of virtues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized. It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like BASE jumping, but without being outstanding and recognized, this person is not yet successful, only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful. The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those virtues. First, a successful person can show only one of those virtues and be successful. Somebody creating a new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks. And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member, and then becoming famous and successful. Finally without any of those virtues , somebody can handle everything from another and get indirectly successful. We have seen that success is not related to the virtues enounced in the statement.","Then, I would say that anybody can be successful However, it is not linked to any willpower of the person but it is due to other factors dependent on theenvironment.",0
1037117.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is true that students, today, are really more inclined to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts. Though it is not what is supposed to be can we blame the students? The education system in many countries, itself, requires it to be like that. And today world has nothing to do with the `facts` indeed. in many countries education systems are so restrictive and so close to development and research that students find themselves in an environment which is totally close to the facts. when using textbooks is the only option the students have and when they are expected to be successful in a kind of competition at the end of which the winner takes it all how can we expect the students to possibly try to reach for the facts? the system forges the students to be tend to get the ideas and concepts. In addition to that we live in a world which has nothing to do with the facts. for there is not a unique objective `fact`. the facts are made not occur any longer. all the facts are mere deceptions.",the worst of all noone is really interested in the facts.,0
1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate. I reason when people hear about a product they should research on the internet or something like that. It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already. Maybe they can get more than money. I think most of the advertisement lies because my mother always says this one, ""if your merchants are good you do not have to call somebody to come around you and take my product.","If you are good already all the people who take your product you do not have to sell yourself as much as possible"".",0
1011356.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be young is beautiful.","If you were a child, you could do what you like without problems.",0
1042567.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"These days, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. yes i agree with this. because the main point is they have no interest in helping others. some young people are giving enough time to help their communities. because they are interested in that. but these days young people are interested in going to the cinema whereas to help others. they are spending more time and more money on the enjoyable entertainment. but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends have enough time to help my communities. we spend time doing that when we are free. So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society. The main idea is that we help the community,by seeing our younger friends or any one,they may try to help the community. so that this will be increased by seeing one another. Finally, it supports the community. the help for the community is the main idea of me. because now adays no one is preffering to help others. because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a little bit of selfishness. so that they cant help the community. the young people now a days prefer to enjoy themselves rather than to help the community. if young people help the community the community will become good. the helping nature of the people should grow from childhood only. because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also. if it does not grow it is impossible to help at a young age. the young people these days are very joyous people. so that they cant help the other people. young people nowadays do not help enough for the communities. because the work pressure on them is very high,and some young students have no time to help the communities because of their studies. these are the main reasons why young people are helping or not helping in the communities.",Some young people may help by words not by money.,0
1332963.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with the statement. In many years, since cars were created and got on sale, people have used them and had them in their lives as their legs to go where they want to go. And cars also contribute to carrying stuff faster and easier, not just people. Today, cars are needed by the world and people's lives as I wrote. But you know what cars need to move. That is gas. People have also used a lot of gas along with cars since they started to drive cars. But it led to oil that creates gas to be used up from the underground of the earth faster.","If people didn't touch it, it wouldn't happen.",0
88199.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays most young people care a lot about their own problems. They do not worry, if they can help an old lady to cross the street. Focusing on their own aims is very important. In addition they only live, because they want to enjoy their lives. They do not look for people, who need help. I think, that young people should be asked or even forced, if they do not want to help other people. On the whole most young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Working in a hospital for a low price can help to remind people, especially young people, that they will become older. For sure, they are forced to see a lot of diseases, for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness. This experience can help to persuade younger people to spend more time helping their communities, especially their own one. Young people can change their minds, because they see, that it makes older people very happy, that there is somebody, who visits them. Secondly parents have got less time, because they have to cook for their children , do the whole housework and they also have to earn the money. Even because of this fact, most of the younger students do not help their own parents. That is really scary.","Once they become parents, then they look back and see their bad behavior.",0

625750.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I neither agree, nor disagree with that statement. I think actually both are important. Let me give a personal story that helped me to draw a conclusion to this question. The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of facts -knowledge and who in fact do not read the newspapers"". Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact do not exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view. For example the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was often called a big actor, a pretender. A lot of people were convinced, that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programmes from his party or important political decisions. And in fact, I often thought similarly- until I met him one day. It was a rainy sunday and some friends of mine and I were walking through the bars of Berlin.",Then Mr Schroeder suddenly stood at our table and asked If we knew where the toilet was.,0

751687.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are. Thirdly, for many factories and supermarkets or sales, maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements. Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheating advertisements can perfect products. There are not products but music, beautiful scenery in them, Of course, not all advertisements are deceitful. many advertisements are good as well as their products.","However, just a few of them.",0

For example, children will enjoy playing computer games.","but, when they become a little older they will enjoy other things like playing football.",0
1300821.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with this statement. I think that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important for several experiences. Also, it is useful in several situations. First of all, I think that people who have knowledge about anything are respected by other people. If the teacher knows not only English but also science, when he or she is asked by his or her students, he or she can answer smoothly. And, they can answer their question. In my case, my English teacher has knowledge of anything. For example, he knows about the art, the history of the living, and the lives of other countries' tribes. When I talked with him about these subjects, I was surprised and thought that I could learn various things from him as my teacher.","I can ask the question that I can't answer , and everytime, he responds tomy question.",0
1110655.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly disagree with advertising activities making products seem much better than they really are. This is a case of manepulating customers' decisions. Some times this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees. Companies and goods sellers should talk and describe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising them in a proper and honest way are mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials of high quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are. Another way of fair advertising activities, is highlighting the efforts that were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection. Marketing trends in some cultures by attracting consumers by utilizing cultural concepts (e. g. cultural and traditional saying as a logo). Another example of fair advertising is studying the trends and behaviour of consumers (e. g. packing children's toys in bright colored boxes), and we shall not consider this a method of manipulation whereas no false information was mentioned about this product.","By observing international markets, manufacturers and goods sellers all over the world are now trying to give glorious and attractive names to their products which isn't a sort of decision making procedure.",0

141650.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it depends on the age of the student. For young students, like secondary and high school it will be more important to know about ideas and concepts. Students at this age are still at the beginning stage or we can say learning state. They will learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future. They may even learn from what is happening in history. By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results. This will be a worthwhile experience for students For example, they are two kinds of cost in production, fixed and variable cost. Fix cost should not be changed at any sum of productions. But when we increase or quantity any certain level, the fixed cost will change. Thus, ideas or concepts and facts support each other. Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts. Because some of the facts may come from ideas or concepts.",The plane that can fly is a fact.,0
307077.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the idea that it is more significant for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. First of all, many of the students would prefer the easier and quicker way of understanding. Understanding ideas and concepts is easier for a student to manage the information. If a student learns a new thing, she or he would first ask the ideas and concepts of the thing to realize the conditions of the new information. This way always seems more practical to the students. I also would prefer this way, since understanding the main idea by explaining both ideas and concepts would make me understand more easily.",Facts are a longer and harder way for most students.,0

626910.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,I do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do. First of all i think that young people have something that is frequently not possessed by elderly people ; that is good health.

It also means the possibility to practise new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air.,"For example, it is also necessary to live with dignity.",0
1717762.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In the world, there are so many cars that people can use them for transportation. It is necessary because of illness. When one of the family members becomes ill, she needs a car. That's why an ambulance may not come immediately. However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home. They also don't go out for this reason. Moreover, telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jams. As long as people work these jobs. There aren't any traffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason. In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads. Besides telecommuting and air pollution, cars are expensive because of technology. When we look at the past, cars are more developed than in the past. Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future. Moreover, For instance, I work in a job, but my earnings are not enough to buy a car. Hence, I can not afford to buy the most developed cars.

In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that.

But, I disagree with this kind of opinion. From a long time ago, people have complained about being younger than them. However, nowadays younger people volunteer in many fields for their community and they study very hard. First of all, we can find many young students to volunteer in many places. Of course, some schools need some volunteer work for their credit. Even though, there are many students doing it just for helping their community. For example, we can see many young people volunteering in the orphanage or hospital or school. They can be very helpful in this kind of place. Because,in the hospital or orphanage, there are many people who desire help. But the supply is very lacking compared to the demand. The young people compensate for the gap. How appreciable a thing it is. Furthermore, many young people study hard and work for their future and their community Actually healthy minded young people can be very important resources for their community. They take responsibility for the future of their society and the results, it can be the most helpful thing for society. For example, if young people neglect their duty in society, it can be a very miserable thing for the community.",Because they are our future by themselves.,0

As per to satisfy the needs of the growing population the usage of cars will definitely increase in the near future which can be a good reason to contradict the statement The second reason is the decline in the cost of.

If you do this process you will understand how much fun it is to get a result with joy. Learning facts is not a good idea. It is like you face the question but you will get the answer right away. It is not fun just getting the answer and not the process. That is why learning the basic process to understand the way to answer is great.

People often claim that young people enjoy life more than old people however I am inclined to believe that,old people can enjoy just the same level or more/I have many reasons to believeso. To start with according to me young people have a good time which is true they do not have many responsibilities ,they can do many sports,ride their bikes and the like but they are also in terms of their education. I think that this is a very hard time in someone's life they have to obey therule,to be disciplined which can be gloomy and sad. In this term of their life they do not have the opportunity to choose what they want. They are in control of their parents or their teachers. According to me,adults have the ability to choose what they want to do which is the most significant issue according to me.",Fredom is something which we enjoy in life naturally and instinctually.,0
1147528.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Have you met a person who is knowledgeable? You might say in your heart. How creative and smart he is! But have you tried to be knowledgable like him? It is definitely not a sophisticated task if you know the benefits from being knowledgable. Indeed, if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you will be more successful in your personal life and in your practical career. First of all, just imagine yourself knowing a huge variety of knowledge. That in fact will make your personal life easier. it will also help you to face many problems in your daily life. As we all know, you may face many challenges in your life and without being broad knowledgeable you can not control all matters. In retrospect, I still remember my uncle who was very knowledgable. I was a big fan of his. I used to ask him. ""my uncle, what makes you successful in your life. ""He answered, "" learn and learn until that last moment of your life.",That will make your future brighter.,0

1166105.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"So different are personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions. As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better. Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions. This example can tell you right. The light came out soon after the invention of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or relation.","As a result, successful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one.",0

929457.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to try to reach good lifestyle standards therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things. Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrast, some think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well. I actually agree with the first idea. these are my following reasons Firstly,success is related toresponsibility. When successful people try new things and take risks they trust their responsible characteristics. For example i know a professor who is so successful at his job. Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to them. In addition to this he never leaves his jobs because ofluck. He usually plans his works and lives for them.","Actually this feature brings success to him In addition to this,success is reletead withexperience.",0
1513527.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies. Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as the Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of the computer all day and play games. They believe computers bring more fun into their life. Some young people just like to go shopping. As a result, they all lack interest in taking part in communites, In conclusion, I think there are many reasons that lead to this result.","it is a negative phenomenon, so I suggest society, their parents and teachers should pay more attention to resolving this problem.",0
164634.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Do you try to learn facts without understanding the ideas and concepts. Nobody can get the facts without understanding the ideas and the concepts I believe that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of details and mistakes. Details are important for the students to understand anything that is not clear. Concepts and ideas should be understood by the students to know how it works. For example, If you understand your major by using the concepts and ideas of the major, you will understand how machines work because you understand the ideas of the machine.",You will have more details about the machine.,0
1028980.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The scholar system gives us a global sight of the main subjects in Sciences, Literature, Music, Sport and other to allow us to find our way. When we are young it is very useful to try a lot of subjects but when you grow up things change. Now I am not anymore interested in playing music or doing mathematics exercises so I am naturally going to specialize in what I like. Thus I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject.","First of all, I really want to know more about a subject which really interests me, namely the Economists.",0
657932.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In order to be a successful person many people have accomplished it by trying new ideas and taking risks. Doing what you already know to do will not take you anywhere if it is what most people do. Many of the best inventions in the world were the outcome of risks taken by ordinary people, just like you and me. We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects. A short example to help me prove my point is the following: There is a man that has been doing the same work over and over again, his life doesn't change. He is good at what he does but just like him, many others are good likehim. If this man would try out new things to change some of the things he does in his normal routine and find a way to be more efficient, he could change his life. He is the only person who can actually do this.",Taking risks is good to do once in a while.,0
266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life.","So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good.",0

1150000.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the author's statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"". It is said that "" God will help them those who help themselves "" , it is implied that they take the risk and try out new things which may lead to great success. For example if Edison had not tried for a new thin he would not have invented the electric bulb. If Newton had eaten the apple, he would not have known the law of gravity. Always it is better to take calculated risks when ever required which helps us to flourish in life. When risk is taken the reward is sure some day. It is suggested that you try a new thing ,experiment which leads to development and growth in the field you are interested in. Aim for stars atleast you can seeeach moon. A good example for successful people is Gandhi, the father of the nation of india ,he tried a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took as much risk as he could , Finally he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land. Thats why the risk is always rewarded which is for a good cause for the maximum benefitof mankind. Most scientists are innovative thinkers they like to do things differently with a calculated risk and end up in getting great scientific inventions.","People will be successful if they try out differently and take risks, if people take active participation in welfare for the country there will be a great development in the country and this will give confidence to people and the economic status of the country will improve.",0
1698141.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Twenty Years Later? It is considered that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This statement may become true or false, because it is a guess but why did people believe in that guess or not. First of all I strongly believed in that statement. As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to travel by bus, subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because of improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have the chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway. That is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling. On the other hand people's choices will change while travelling along the cities; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropolis city to a tourist city in Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car. Because for making another guess; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all. Time is a valuable thing now; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay for a plane ticket for not being late for life. In all these respects above; transportation will see great changes in the aspect of people'slives.",These changes will be rooted from the improvements in transportation vehicles and economic conditions for instance in the fuel oil people face.,0

323858.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything.","Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble.",0

It totally depends on people to people. Firstly i want to say that older people can do any thing like young people like if they want to go to a party they can go. if they want to do dance at a party they can do. i had seen an old person at someone's party. these old age people dance like young people.,he was so active.,0

688768.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes I do agree with this statement. In my opinion, when a person invents something new which is not available on the market. He tries to include everything that he could do. This is a good thing. But when the time comes for advertising this product. The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he can get profits as fast as he can. Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones. When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give. Like to give a mobile phone headset, a car charger, a mobile phone carry case, some applications, games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones. When a customer looks at this kind of advertisement he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw in the advertisement. Then the shop keeper shows him, he does not like the item. Why ? Because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones. But they find that they are not original. This causes a lot of problems when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else. I would like to share an example that I experienced a year or two ago. There is a trademark that is really popular among ladies. It sells readymade clothes for women. And his logo is also very popular. A shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost half the price of the material the original shop is selling and he advertised it in various magazines and newspapers.",People started buying from him not only keeping in mind that it's the same kind of material.,0

But others think that travelling with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfortable. And i'm one of them. First of all, if you have a tour guide and a group of companions, you will not feel very free. Travelling with a tour guide, the plan will be formerly ordered, something you want to see another thing or want to go to another place will not be allowed. You can't change the plan. But for me, the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like, but i can't change, because of the whole ground. That makes me feel very upset.

I believe that I can state this position through presenting the career of some of my friends. Observing their works and characteristics, most of them are challengers, who always like to try different things from others and like to invent something new that no one has ever thought of. If they believe that one project that has been planned very well based on their planned strategy through their experiences and collaborations co-works, they are not afraid of taking risks of loosing their fonds. I have a friend that has been working for the health sector which specializes in HIV/AIDS for many years in the world. I would like to say that she is a sufficiently successful person, considerate in her profession and her economic status that can live on her own. Still continuing working for the HIV/AIDS issue in the international organization, but she has currently started to organize one project with her friends, which is very new here in Panama. The project is combined with animal therapy and small notion of HIV. My friend has never had a pet. Never.","At least she is interested in animals, especially dogs.",0
398389.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Maybe learning facts is important for students. But I think if they understand ideas and concepts, they will get facts, too. I think understanding ideas and concepts is easier to understand, instead of just learning facts. When I study biology, and history in English, my tutor always gives me examples, and ideas. And it is always helpful to me, and I will never forget about it. For foreign language students, the ideas and examples are helpful. Because they could not understand English well as Americans do, they could not just learn facts from books. So, the ideas or concepts are very important to them to learn facts. To understand ideas and concepts is more fun to do. If students get ideas, concepts, and examples from the picture, they can understand more clearly. To draw pictures or diagrams, students will have fun in the class. It is like a laboratory in the biology class. The laboratory exercise is so much fun, and students can get their main ideas of what they are studying. I think the statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.","""It is true.",0

There should be an energy when young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the environment they live in. It is sad that people can't see young people attending the activities of their communities. The reasons that cause this situation are competition, education and value. First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate in any activities. There is more stress on their shoulders, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and perform well in school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes.

1361043.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is a fact. Adversetising is the engine of many companies all around the world, companies that could not sell a unit of their products if they could not have access to advertising agencies. For example, everyone is aware of the dangers of drinking soda but because the companies that produce soda invest millions of dollars inadvertising, they keep selling millions of units all around the world. Another clear example that supports the statement is tobacco companies; companies like the worldwide company Phillips-Morris whose business is to sell as many cigarettes as they can, even though they are aware of the consequences of smokingas their customers do, they keep increasing their profits year after year because they great invest inadvertising, this is what permits them to show their product as something that is neither bad nor good, just as something that exists.","Usually many products fail because of their marketing policies, some companies with really good products have declared bankruptcy after putting out their products without good marketing support or many companies with regular products have been successful because of it; one example of this, is that millions of clothes companies exist around the world but not all of them are known in different countries and they do not sell as the known ones do; many brands are sold in the world, brands like Tommy Hilfigher, Diesel, Perry Ellis among many, but it is not their quality or any other specific characteristics that these brands have that permit them to succeed over the companies that have no marketing policy.",0

We have the ones that are ""laisy"", that prefer to stay with their own knowledge and continue life as a constant person. But on the other hand we have the ""active"" person, the ones that are comfortable with having new experiences. I think people have to be positive in life and while we are exposed to new experiences we need to integrate and to deal with them taking risks and caring about ourfuture. One of the reasons I agree with the risky people, is because I am like that. I am the person that never gives up during my new experience, maybe I use my experience from the past to help myself guide and find a solution. These kinds of people have a lot to bring to the world because they are constantly creating new things and new ways of seeing things. Another reason for my agreement with the first statement, is because I imagine the future in the hands of people in front of life this way and it produces me something disgusting. I am not able to share with these kinds of people because life is a game and you have to play with it and be positive with any obstacle that could infer you during your life and take it as a risk that you could manage having a mental health.","Finally, I will always be happy to meet risky people and to know that there are more people that take life as a risk than those who are afraid to confront life, this is why I am sure that sooner or later these kinds of people are going to need help, because life is based on the future and there is no future with our new experiences.",0

Oil prices are a principal problem for western countries which haven't their own oil supplies. For example in europe, it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes, insurance and enormous fuel costs. Also the cost of space in major cities makes the price rise. One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe, e. g. the government in Vienna is making cycling routes in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its inhabitants.

Understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life, once students understand concepts and ideas facts will come to them and, students will know what they are talking about later on. First of all, understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will naturally come to them. for example, in business, if the students boss tells them to go do this this and this the student will immediately understand the idea and once he has understood the idea he will naturally understand the concept in order to do something. Second, once the student understands the idea and concept behind something the facts will automatically come to him. for instance, once the student understands an idea he understands a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand facts because because all facts have an idea and a concept behind them. moreover, it would be hard for the student just to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life has concepts and ideas even facts.

They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product.

1075450.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There has been an argument about which is better; having broad understanding in many topics or specialized knowledge in one specific subject. When it comes to academic subjects, I think that specialization is essential for the following reasons. Almost all areas of knowledge require professional specialists to handle and develop them because they are very complicated nowadays. It is true that our society needs generalists who have a wide range of knowledge, but generalists' knowledge is based on the specialists' works in each area. It is specialists who make a new discovery and produce knowledge, having the ability to perform sound research on each specific subject. That's why I insist that specialists' role is primary.","Moreover, having broad knowledge is an easy job for everyone because sharing information is easier than ever before.",0

But being specialized in only one subject means that the person knows his job perfectly, so he can have more chances to be hired for a specific kind of job. In my opinion, I think that having a broad knowledge is better than specializing in only one subject. We were spoken with my american civilisation teacher about that.","Is it better to do his master's and to continue his doctorate on the same topic or should we change to show our skills?

1846107.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement. To me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies, so the entire population depends on advertisements which show ""incredible products"" which can resolve many different problems, such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain, or how to repair a part of the furniture; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program. In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and wastes a lot ofmoney. For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one).

101001.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"For some reasons we think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. At first sight we can state this because it is clear that it is easier to be young, in good health with future perspectives than to be old, to suffer and to count the years before dying. Besides, parents often say to children that they are lucky. I can't deny that being old is not a very funny thing at all for the body, for the health but on the other hand it implies that you have lived a lot of differentthings, you have found your way, you have children and maybe little children. in a few words at this age, people have done more difficult things and they can use their time for pleasure, for resting, for what they want. On the other hand, being young is not such an easy thing and it is often a difficult part of life, throughout the teenage period. indeed teenage years are the time of self construction,the time to discover love, problems, to take the first decisions. And that is not an easy thing because teenagers don't have a lot of experience yet neither self confidence.

In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure.

First of all, cars are really convenient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short. It can drive from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday. No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above.

Sometimes, someone asks why he/ or she can get everything that he/or she wants and I can't. In my opinion, the answer is very simple. It is necessary work and I work very hard to achieve my goals. People who are successful have three essential characteristics that frustrated people do not. The first is to take risks all the time, second they are confident in themselves and the last they are positive. First, people who are successful say yes to almost everything to do!. For example, I was working on a project in the pathology laboratory, but a colleague from my field invited me to work on a different project. I worked with him without thinking about the inconveniences of the result. when I accepted, I meant to study harder and for long hours to compensate for my deficiencies in something new.

"" That is what parents often said. But I do not completely agree with the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In deed,I support the view that specialization is a good thing. So, people know what they are talking about. In some fields, like men who built houses, specialization is necessary : how could someone as good at painting as a wood table? Furthermore, it implies a longer study if you want to have broad knowledge. Moreover, if someone has broad knowledge, I think it is impossible that he knows accurately all his many academic subjects he has even learned. This is a great problem, there are not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity. You need to be very smart, like Leonard from Vinci. He is a good example.

237139.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I agree with the statement because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts. The first factor is age at this age as a student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are the first step for a student. At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts. Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts. Any student who is getting older can learn from his past about the facts. For example consider a 10th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world.,So it is better for him to concentrate on his studies then to know about the facts.,0

For a successful person there is always a challenge, a risk that has to be taken in order to continue his or her legacy, interesting or not that is the way they keep it up in order to gain, win and have success, and feel they are aboveeveryone. We have to remember that these people have already won and that perhaps, they think, that they have nothing to lose by trying new things, and by taking new risks, that is why they continue being on top of the world by their positive attitude and their challenging ideas. We also have to remember that eventhough they are successful they can also make mistakes and lose everything they have accomplished throughout their lives.","but it is in their attitude, especially a positive attitude that makes them recover eventhough going against all odds and eventhough they do not recover from one, two events they will take this new challenge again,and risk.",0
350859.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I think it is really important nowadays to have many academic subjects. Indeed, a person who has different skills can easily understand different points of view in a company. This understanding is really necessary for people who are managers. He has to manage people, suppliers, to understand consumers, to take decisions for his company. For example he has to take financial decisions which are really important in a company if he does not take into account all the advantages or drawbacks of his decisions. The survey of the company could be in danger. Moreover, we can take the example of an individual entrepreneur as a director of a restaurant. If the director does not have knowledge of cooking, the cook can do everything he wants. This kind of advantage can be dangerous for the director because he does not really understand all about his own restaurant. I think that sometimes it is really necessary to have knowledge in different types of subjects even if we are specialized in one or a few specific subjects.","Furthermore, it can be really interesting for somebody to have different academic subjects not only for working but for his own.",0

I disagree with the above statement because, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems to be alright when in childhood, but this seems to be complex and cumbersome as we grow older and older. Firstly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly. For example, consider a high school student. If he needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school, apart from his personal interest which he shows in a particular subject, the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome. Secondly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, the frequency at which we do get updates about these subjects greatly matters.

1299460.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like. Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound.","At this time, if the teacher uses a fact which is like putting the method into an experiment.",0

I agree with this statement for many reasons. I could say that in the world of business the most important characteristic is honesty, so if a company makes an advertisement that makes a product seem much better than it really is this company will probably lose a lot of customers. I think that this consequence that I ` ve explained is a risk for all companies. After stating that losing a lot of clients is a risk for a company, in other words I can say that if this company doesn`t change the advertisement it will surely lose all the customers and failin the end. I think that nowadays a company must make large efforts to survive and the most important effort is to improve the honesty of the advertisement to make the products seem like they really are. For example, I recently got a new car that seems like a wonderful car in the advertisement. Initially this car doesn`t make noise and doesn ` t cause problems for me but after a month it begins to stop more often and it begins to have a lot of problems. Furthermore I have to spend more money to adjust to this car than the money that I spend to buy it.

That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being makes it easy to succeed in their common life. First, usually successful people attract more successful people. For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends. That is, this meeting provides them with the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and these kinds of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove themselves and normally, they are going to win, the people tell us that they are lucky people. It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance.

1581339.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks. The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal, he wants to have something new and more difficult to do. Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succeeded in something, he will always want more. Alpinists, for example, don't usually stop climbing after they manage to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other mountain , harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conqueror, didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finally defeated. And I think because he was successful for the first time, he couldn't get rid of his willpower. An other reason would be the fact that successful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships.

If I can not communicate in English and not my mother tongue, I worry about it. I may not be able to listen to a guide and not to see the direction. Then I may get lost. In my case, I traveled in London alone. I have a map and book which has the details about that city. I walked around the city while I looked at the book. But I got lost.

15340.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students can learn about many things in school. When students learn new things, It is very important for students to know what they are learning from classes. And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts. I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from text books. To understand the basic idea is not simply but, in my opinion, it can expand the student's abilities of thinking and creation. Understanding new ideas and concepts can take a long time and sometimes it could take a few decades for students. It can be a problem learning new things. That's why some instructors and students take shortcuts to learn new things. For example, when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio, so called 'Golden ratio' which is believed to be the perfect proportion for every object. It is a very difficult theory to understand for freshmen and it could take more than 2years, but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory. Even though it is difficult to understand the ideas, students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it. It can be easy to create new things with the basic concepts. For instance, a musician who understands the principles of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and rhythms using the basic music element. Consequently, I recommend understanding the main ideas when students learn new things.","Even though it is a hard and difficult way to learn about new things, after understanding the notion from the basics.",0

1840823.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts where it could bring out the natural talents in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room. Understanding the ideas and concepts makes the childern think more scientifically and discover more new things about a particular concept it inculcates a habit in children to analyse things in a more broad way and arrive at the results on their own. Understanding things rather than learning things from facts from the class room helps the child to remember the things for longer and in inculcate new ideas in arriving at new ideas which help them in a long way to go. Also, learning concepts and ideas rather than learning facts which were written or told by some one helps to develop a desire for inviduality in the child and to evaluate the issues in a rather broad way standing different from others. For example one of my friends with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed an idea which he implemented in one of his projects and his project was selected to be demonstrated at NASA in the United states. and he was also rewarded by the president of my country as the best out standing research student in his age group. Learning concepts and ideas would also children in their education where he could he could he could be interested in fields like research and things that really do matter a lot and even have lots of influence on his/her professional career. concepts and ideas and are not only confined to four walls of a room where these could be obtained from many places in nature in books in people and even in him self.",Finally i would conclude knowledge of ideas and concepts is a large ocean where there is no age barrier one doesn't have to understand the concept and implement his ideas inpractice.,0
354293.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""youth is blunder ,manhood is struggle , oldage is a regent"" This quotation really sets out the view towards the essay. I think older people can enjoy their life more then the young ones. For me age doesnt matter much when it comes to the enjoyment of life. Each thing that a young man can do , an old man can do too. The following essay will clear out my point of view Firstly,the experience the old person has ,for me the experience is the mother of wisdom ,so if your more wise more easily you can overcome the hindrance in your life. Old people are more aware of the outcome of life ,the phases of their life which they have been through. yes i do agree that young people do have more agility and fitness than old peopledo ,but if an old person keeps healthy by various exercise then he can also be like the current youth Secondly,the way you consider the enjoyment. If the young person thinks the enjoyment in life is going to pubs,disco,then the way could not the oldperson go towards this place. what fundamentally differs between young and old people is their age limit and age affecting their ability ,but I do not think age can be related toenjoyment. An old person does enjoy their life in their own way a way which would never lead to no dilemmas occurring in their life.","Each step of the old person's life would be a well calculated ,well organized one Lastly,""old is better than gold"" and really for me the gold is an enjoyment in the sense that the money value of the gold,for me money is the main source of enjoyment and old is better than gold than way not the oldperson can enjoy more life thenyoung youths do.",0
1329241.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family. I would like to give an example of my father who is a manager in a company, When i was a toddler he taught me to take first firm few steps in the path of my life and gave me good quality education by enrolling me in a good public school where i could set fort my academicjourney, so he has the responsibility to give me a good career in the path of my life by giving much attention to me he rather by enjoying himself he gave me platform to secure me future to path of success. Also, if we look at the cut throat competition between the world there is not enough time for elderly people to enjoy life Although this same holds for younger people, they could be able to manage time for their enjoyment. It is also important for younger people to enjoy it because of the study burden because i believe that a healthy body can dwell in a healthy mind so for the future success they must be stress free. Enjoyment for younger people i believe that it is a dose for their tired nerves and if taken this dose will soothe their tired nerves and rejuvenate them for the upcomming responsibilities. This will allow him greater success throughout life as the elderly have crossed such a limit they have no more spare time to do such enjoyment.",They have attended the proper opportunity of enjoyment at their time of development.,0
504053.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is important or learning the facts.

475475.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago. To improve its condition, I attend this activity. In conclusion, Japanese young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities.",Afterthought activities improve not only Japanese society but also the knowledge of young Japanese people.,0
477986.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts. Therefore the amount of money is a very important aspect of human life. Everybody has different points of views about how they must earn the money. Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger. Burger King advertisements are the most popular examples for the curious consumers to find out about their consumer rights. Last but not least, being the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the price of your product. For instance Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market. So they are able to change the price of their products, Ipod, freely. How did they become the main producer? With advertisements actually.","They presumed their product would survive for 2 years, but after ten months it was almost broken down.",0

I agree with this statement for many reasons. I could say that in the world of business the most important characteristic is honesty, so if a company makes an advertisement that makes a product seem much better than it really is this company will probably lose a lot of customers. I think that this consequence that I ` ve explained is a risk for all companies.","After stating that losing a lot of clients is a risk for a company, in other words I can say that if this company doesn`t change the advertisement it will surely lose all the customers and failin the end.",0

1692161.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments. I believe most of these advertisements make products seem better because they only talk about good things about their products and they also use attractive things, such as people, to fascinate people. Since advertisements only show the benefits of that product, it seems very attractive to people. For example, my mother wanted to have a new vaccum.","When she was watching the TV show, there was a commercial about a new vaccine.",0
1273655.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When I was a lazy student, I always tried to make out why my teacher insisted on teaching these ideas and concepts. Now I have grown up and got the main idea step by step. Concepts and ideas must be learned clearly to predict the facts. First of all I totally agree with this situation. Not being able to understand ideas and concepts and then predicting or learning facts means wanting to run not being able to learn how to walk. For example there are two students in the same class. They are good friends there. Student A tries to understand basic things and after all the notion. He wants to be the top in class. But Student B just tries to understand cause and effect. His aim is to get enough marks in class. Do you ever wonder why teachers try to teach notions. I did, the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger. I mean their aims are not just to get the highest marks. When students learn ideas, concepts etc. he/she can develop that subject. He/she really should be the competent of this subject. In addition, a student who wants to be an engineer, he/she has to learn all about the subject if s/he really creates a unique thing or innovation.","To sum up, you have to make our way between these Student A and B.",0
528240.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ideas and concepts is one of the most important reasons for the education of young people. I strongly agree with this statement so that all the facts have an origin in an idea. In the first place, the importance of understanding our history and facts does not only depend on our knowledge of the facts, but also on the comprehension of why all of the things are and were happening in our world. World War II was the most cruel war that humankind has ever suffered as a result of millions of victims in both parts. Beyond these atrocities there were awful ideas about how to rule the world. Furthermore, I can see the reasons for bringing a country to the war as the United States did to that war. The US could see people having their natural rights which are inherited from human beings such as freedom or religion. These are ideas. Second, we use ideas and concepts not only to find out facts, but also to learn about our future problems and facts.",Maths is a science where you have to understand theories and concepts to solve the problem.,0
494614.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagreed with the viewpoint expressed in the text. It is controversial whether the number of cars will decrease in future. The two types of viewpoints will be suggested as follows. On the one hand, some people believe that cars will be reduced in near future. The cost of maintaining a private car is increasing due to the high price of oil and public transportation services are revised these days. It would be much more comfortable to use public transportation rather than a private car. Furthermore, the new means of transportation is developing now. For example, there is the craft considered to be the means of transportation for the next generation. It provides a much more comfortable environment to ride in because it doesn't touch a surface underneath the body. If it becomes cheaper and smaller as common people can afford it, cars will be replaced by bicycles. On the other hand, other people think that it is impossible that cars will decrease within such a short period. Cars have been the most popular machine for transportation in recent days. The world's population rises at an increadible speed and the most populated countries, such as China or India, start to develop industrially. More cities have become modernized, more cars are produced to supply increasing demands. The future means of transportation still have to be improved a lot. Moreover, if a new innovative mode of transportation appears, it would take a lot of time to replace cars.",Many governmental and social systems are related to cars.,0
266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices.","Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products.",0
1703643.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with this statement that ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects"". As per my view looking at present day science , it is better to have a lot of knowledge of many subjects. As science is in a phase of revolution and today's necessities that people should have an interdisciplinary person. Another point is that using a multidimensional approach to solve any problem. Firstly, now a days it's time for revolution and renovation. Since, time is changing and we are in the 21st century, so we have rebuilt many concepts because today science has achieved so much and technology is also in very good condition. We also have to find out some answers to many questions which are not solved yet. Therefore, we have to gain knowledge of many subjects to improve our ideas. Secondly, we should try to get enrolled in various new and interdisciplinary subjects.",Here I want to say that at present time we should try to get acceptance in various new subjects and it's much better to take an Interdisciplinary subject.,0
492113.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, the education systems are generally based on teaching ideas and concepts. The ideas of famous people and some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime. I think this system will not work in the near future. Because of technological advances, students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world. Thus, they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts.",They will deal with the issues which they really exist.,0
136505.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ignorance is far more important than knowing the facts. understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher. humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the facts from the early stone age we understand concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubbing two stones together thus understanding the process of combustionby using stones. we cant simply rely on the subject by knowing but for understanding it. for example every one knows about the law of conservation of energy,a person who understands applied in the form of electricity or mechanical engine. A student who got good marks in an examination ca not become a good engineer or doctor or infact, be good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good. Thus, application is important for a student who comes with an understanding of the subject. A practical understanding of the subject is preferred rather than simply knowing it ,this is the reason why nowadays education orl study is based on formal work rather than simply class room teaching. each and every course of today whether you take a science or art or technology project and the field work isintroduced. The concept of understanding does not give us success in profession but also helps us get better in our subjects which we do not want to get for our lifetime.",this doesnt happen simply by knowing.,0
1395384.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I completely disagree with this statement. Ideas and concepts can be learned easily but the most important thing is to practise them and it's more difficult than learning. In school we learn and sometimes memorize a lot of things. From the age of 7 to almost 21 we just try to listen to our lessons, readbooks,do our homework. During all this learning period students are just passive factors,they just listen. When they involve actively this period,""learning"" reaches the real target of it. If students only learn ideas and concepts and they can't find a chance to apply them to the real world or practise, these ideas only take place in the brain for a while and then they will be forgotten. I learned a lot of theories,ideas but I don't remember anything about them now and I can't use this information in any area of my life. It's more functional for children to learn facts rather than ideas. This makes their life easy in the future and the learning process more efficient in this way. Today our education system's based on these ideas which are mentioned above. Teachers only try to give a framework for ideas and concepts with this method students try to just memorize and they don't have the ability to research,because their task is only to learn limited sources of information. They don't understand the real taste of learning so the learning process is getting unsuccessful.",Education also shapes the identity and character of a person.,0
1138119.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","yeah i totally agree with this statement because what is allowing the car to turn on is the gas and the gas is getting more and more expensive because of the decrease in the worldwide gas resources due to overexploitation. everybody knows thinking about how we are going to substitute gas,some solutions are there but they are too expensive butwhen we find an appropriate and non polluting fuel it will come out with new automotives it will be a revolution. nowadays cars emit too much carbon into the atmosphere and it s very bad for our planet,cars pollute too much and we can t keep on pollutinglike nothing will happen,people will realise how bad cars are for the atmosphere and everybody will prefer to have a bike or a non - pollutingautomotive vehicle. technology allows us to build these kinds of cars but the reason why the car builders aren't generalizing this kind of car is because now the governments and people don't really see how fast carbon damage our planet but if we keep on polluting with our cars like they have no consequences in something like 10 years the effects will be more violent and will happen more frequently and that will make everybody want to stop polluting before it s too late.",cars are being banned everywhere in the world.,0
1724026.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I absolutely agree with the statement, that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for several reasons: First, our everyday actions are not based on facts we learned by heart but on ideas we understood. An easy example is the action of crossing the street, I look to the right and to the left to ensure that there is no car on the street, because I understand that it is dangerous to walk through a street with driving cars on it since they would drive over me. If I had only learned it by heart I would have crossed a street by driving cars on it and so I wouldn't be here doing the Toefl. Second, you can only solve a problem if you understand the problem. You will never come to an appropriate solution to a problem just by learning some facts. An example here is a mathematical task: Although you might have learned all the relevant facts for a test you will face problems when the tasks derived from the standard tasks you have practiced in your math lessons.","Third, the recency factor of ideas you understood once is much higher than the recency factor of learned facts.",0

1907556.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. That is true. That is the way they sell their products, because people always want to buy better products. And the advertisements know it, so they make the products look better to sell them. First, the advertisements have to sell their products, so they try to explain about their products. Then they do not want to tell disadvantages about their products, they just want to tell advantages of them. In the process, they sometimes have to cover the disadvantages. So they tell other people about their products being overly good. And other people believe what they say, and think about what they heard. People will think that the product is really good because they did not hear about its disadvantages. A good looking is tasting good. As for products, it is really important how they look. If they look good, then they seem to work better or taste better than how they are. So when people make the products, they make them look better to cover customer's eyes. And other people would believe that the products are better than they really are because they are looking good, believing looking good is better than looking bad. These days, people care so much about the products' appearance. For example, there are many different types of vending machines. They look all different. And there is the best working one which sucks things really well and there is the best looking one which looks strong and fancy, then the best seller would probably be the looking fancy and strong one rather than the really working good one.",Most products seem much better than they really are because that's how they have been made.,0
1744381.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yong people enjoy life more than older people do. I agree with this statement. Nowadays young people enjoy themselves well compared to in the old days. Because at this present time they have so many entertaining equipments and these all are not available in the olden days. And the world is developing rapidly. At a time, young people also worked hard to achieve their goals and to realise their ambitions. They are doing hardwork and enjoy it at a time. They separate their time for working and for enjoying themselves. Now these days so many young people are working for many great companies and corporate companies,then they all work weekly for five days for company and the remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family. So young people also do hardwork but they make some schedule and follow that. Now so many young people are working for some company or worked for some institute,But these companies and institutes are built by old people. So old people work in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run those institutes and companies. From the above two sentences i can say that old people work harder than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels. And these days also have some young managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists,But they all get that companies and that industry from their parents and they run those companies verywell. Suppose Anil Abani is a great industrialist and great managing director for Reliance companies. But he gets them from his father and he also works hard and develops their companies and develops their shares in the present market. So finally i am supporting that young people enjoy their life more than older people and they also work hard and get good positions in their lives.",And for hardworking older people one of the best examples is Bill Gates.,0
1012427.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this statement. No matter whether successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing. Successful people try new things and taking risks are the best thing that they need to do. For example, an animal professor who discovers medicine for humans. If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have, so this is not called discovery and they are no longer needed. Of course they need to find new medicines and it involves risks because they test animals. Another example is students who are successful in studying. Why are they successful? The reason is they already try new things such as reading a lot of different books and communicating with teachers. The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required. If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful students? They will stay the same without studying new things. They cannot only study what they know well. Otherwise, they cannot be open-minded. For me, I have a personal story about this topic. I am trying new things and also taking risks. I came to America for study. I am trying to study new cultures and languages. I am not successful yet, but I am trying to be successful. Also this is a risk for me because my parents cannot afford me to study at university in America. The tuition is too high.

I think most people have experienced it before. While you wanted to stay a bit longer at one attraction, the tour guide would tell you to go back to the shuttle bus and you could just stay at that attraction for a maximum of 30 minutes. You were not able to understand deeply about the real life of that country or the attraction because you would not have enough time to explore it by yourself. You needed to be prepared for a long and boring explanation before you could visit the attraction.

266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man.","One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?.",0

476573.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"60% of people who work do not have time for entertainment because of their work. They can not do anything about this. So I think young people will enjoy life more because they have a lot of free time, they are healthier and they and they usually do not have children. The young people have a lot of free time, and their life will not be affected if they waste it. When I was in high school I usually did not study that much, and I always drove cars with my friends. I only study before those tests, and I usually get good grades.","When we look at the health of a young man, it will be much better than an old one.",0
865467.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this statement. I would like to talk about my opinion with 3 reasons. First, It is a problem for us, humans. We already know the earth has a lot of environmental problems. I think CO2 is the most famous cause of destroying the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how convenient a car is. If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can't do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries. I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too.

I think in twenty years there will be lots more cars in use than there are today. In this essay I will give some reasons and good examples why i think like that. the first reason is that most people would like to have a car. because cars are the most comfortable and most exciting preference for people to go somewhere quickly. In fact this reason is really a considerable one, which is why people can not change their opinion. for example I have a car and when I want to go somewhere my first option is to take my car. instead of taking buses or walking. and I am really sure most drivers think just like me. because it is the most comfortable one , even though it is not the cheapest one. the second reason is that people do not consider the traffic problem and this problem should be solved by the government. they think that the government should make big wide roads and design perfect traffic regulations. people just use their cars and don't think one of the reasons for the traffic jam is their cars. And also the government can not take radical decisions about traffic because everyone has a right to use his or her own car everywhere he or she wants.",because of this there are not fewer cars in use or we can say that there are lots of cars in use now and it will be the same in the future in conclusion because most people would like to have a car and do not think about the solution to traffic jams there wo not be fewer.,0
112005.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter.","In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"".",0
28471.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I would say that I do not agree either disagree with both of the statements.

An idea could be difficult to explain, but with a fact, an example, the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to memorize.","As an example, I can speak about the french revolution.",0
807318.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Long has been written about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do, as well as how old people enjoy life more than young people do. Nevertheless, I consider that enjoying life has more to do with people's attitude toward life than with them being young or old. Therefore, I will try to describe some ideas in order to support the view that enjoying life has much more to do with an attitude than with age. For example, many people might think that enjoying life may be related to age. Therefore, if you are a young person you could enjoy life more than if you are an old person. Old people might think that young people have much more energy, or more activities in a day and therefore they enjoy life much more than them.",The only thing they don't stop thinking about is that usually young people don't have as much spare time as old people could have.,0
1263328.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I am now 20 years old. Older people would say I am very young to understand society as an adult. Younger people would say I am old enough to go out of the family and experience the world. In the year 2006, many things happened to me. I went to the United States of America for the first time, and have been a student at a college. I had to experience everything in a foreign language, English. Imagine, It still might have been hard if I was a student in my country, but i had to do it in a foreign country. It gave me new experiences in my life. I had to make my decisions on my own. My family and my friends were too far from me to give advice. It was a hard year for me. So younger people enjoy their life more than older people do. Young people might feel the world and think in their own ways but they still stay in a particular place like a house, school or by their friends.","They would also not know exactly what is happening in the world, What they do everyday is play , hang out with their friends and do their duty as children in their family.",0

519398.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects,while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject. As for me, I would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only. Though there are a variety of subjects at a university for you to follow with. But a single man's energy and time are so limited that you can't afford wasting too much time on subjects that have nothing to do with your future career. Imagine a freshman majoring in Physics with a Selection Of English Literature in hand all day around, will he succeed in his field someday? Hardly. Furthermore, we call these ""academic subjects"" because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school. They are far more complex and complicated. You can't expect to manage it within a semester or two. It needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level in a certain field. Some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because of an affection on the spur of the moment, as soon as he realizes that he won't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever, he will just simply drop halfway. Finally, having a determination to specialize in a single subject is a crucial step on your way to self-realization. Anybody who wants to be successful and legendary in his field must have perseverance and expertise.",Michael Jordan may be a good example.,0
1042567.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"These days, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. yes i agree with this. because the main point is they have no interest in helping others. some young people are giving enough time to help their communities. because they are interested in that. but these days young people are interested in going to the cinema whereas to help others. they are spending more time and more money on the enjoyable entertainment. but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends have enough time to help my communities. we spend time doing that when we are free. So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society. The main idea is that we help the community,by seeing our younger friends or any one,they may try to help the community. so that this will be increased by seeing one another. Finally, it supports the community. the help for the community is the main idea of me. because now adays no one is preffering to help others. because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a little bit of selfishness. so that they cant help the community. the young people now a days prefer to enjoy themselves rather than to help the community. if young people help the community the community will become good. the helping nature of the people should grow from childhood only. because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also. if it does not grow it is impossible to help at a young age. the young people these days are very joyous people.",so that they cant help the other people.,0
1558621.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations. I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products. So it will even cause the situation worse than now.",From those kinds of accounts I expressed my opinion.,0
1237588.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people try to do new things and not only what they are already good at doing. In my opinion this is a main aspect of a successful person Indeed, successful people have the ability to understand what they can try to do even if they know that they already haven't the preparation to do it. Someone can't become a real successful person if he doesn't try to risk. He has to have the ability to understand that he can try to do something even if he does know how to do it. In modern society it is more difficult to raise over other people than some years ago, so people, who want success, have to go over their own limits to try if they are really able to do some thing. It is like when someone bets, he doesn't know if he will win, but he knows that if he will win he will be happy and successful.",Nowadays there isn't so much space for weak people in the high levels of society.,0
197162.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yes, i agree with the statement. Young people are the future of the world,they remain active in their young period but while they get older they losepatience,concentration and the body organs get weak,they may see inactive compared with young people. As young people have many dreams and have many goals to achieve. They work accordingly to achieve their goals and their age is in the stage that they are ready to do anything,young people say and prove 'nothing is impossible'. they can jump,play and enjoy the wholelife to the maximum extent. well about older people they will losetheir patience ,they have to look after the whole family and will face many problems regarding family and now they have no strength to do more work,no strength to dance ,jump and travel. For example ,lets take my young cousin,when his family went on holiday including his grandfather who is 70 years old,my cousin explored the whole city and visited many religious places,which made him happy or he may enjoythat. while his grandfather who is also interested in seeing those places, was due to his physical weakness and due to the temperature variance he didn't resist at that place. And many places are in hilly areas which are to be travelled by walk,as his grandfather had no strength and he didn't enjoy the trip.

Success and what are the essential ingredients which make a situation or a person successful? In simple terms, success is achieving goals with maximising efficiency. To set a goal for himself and envision the future is what successful men do differently. In life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of those decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally. How much a person is ready to take risks will determine how committed he is to his goals. Coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endeavour.",I want to give an example of Mr.,0

How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings.",so it was flying in the air.,0
378807.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life. It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"".","A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts.",0
381881.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,Yes i agree with the concept of discussing that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

524381.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities. However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry for her and regretted focusing on just the quantity of the feasible time. In addition, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never shows one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is an example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyers in Korea. He is renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedication to society.",It is evident that he has limited time to do multiple things at the same time.,0
1530737.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow. One, from my personal experience, traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by yourself. Because the travel company which the guide is affiliated with always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights. In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took. Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes. According to the 8 years of personal travel experience, most travel accidents occur in a group traveler. Because when we travel in a group by a tour guide, people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide. And that causes accidents such as robbery. One of my roommates once traveled to Spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated.",And he paid attention.,0

Maybe learning facts is important for students. But I think if they understand ideas and concepts, they will get facts, too. I think understanding ideas and concepts is easier to understand, instead of just learning facts. When I study biology, and history in English, my tutor always gives me examples, and ideas. And it is always helpful to me, and I will never forget about it. For foreign language students, the ideas and examples are helpful. Because they could not understand English well as Americans do, they could not just learn facts from books. So, the ideas or concepts are very important to them to learn facts.",To understand ideas and concepts is more fun to do.,0

252559.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Any other expression would not be more important than this topic. Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same. I believe, traffic is not just a waste of time; in addition, it is a waste of energy.","For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour.",0
43322.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In Japan, where I live, many people may think that there will be more cars in use in the future. However, I support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years for the following reasons. First, the price of energy will become higher than today. For example, many people prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy. Many car makers are making their efforts to produce cars which need not so much energy, though, such cars are high cost. In addition, there is difficulty in developing new laws that cost energy. As the above explanation demonstrates, in the future, people will use fewer cars than there are today. Second, environmental problems change people's way of thinking about traffic methods. For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city environmental problems are so serious. Originally Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had not so much a train network. However, the South Korean government improved the capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people. The government will continue such efforts to make Seoul's air clean. Trains seem to replace the car-centric traffic system.","As the above example demonstrates, there will be fewer cars today.",0

However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here.",I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car.,0

1071263.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this opinion. I think, in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. I have some reason to think about that. First, some companies are now inventing new cars, like hybrid cars, electric cars something like that. Actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes. We are also interested in cars that are good for the environment. The car industry will change their way of selling the car to customers. Of course, I think of the customer for the environment of the earth will change in this few years. Second, I think that physical translation is not convenient in countryside. For me, I live in the country side, I can not ride on the bus or train when I want. It is different between the big cities like Tokyo and small cities. So people who live in the country side, they use their own car now. I also use my own car. The number of cars in countryside has increased more than before.

1206804.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The department I am currently studying has a policy to encourage all the students to specialize in finance or marketing. The logic behind it is that you can not make smart choices if you have less and broad knowledge in a specific topic. I totally agree with the idea that focusing is better. Because I believe that you can not talk or make comments about every topic in the world and specializing encourages you to learn more and makes you love the topic more. Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details. Therefore the ability to make a comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible. For instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film can only tell one or two sentences. However a person who watched the film and read many things from the magazines about the film can make comments or discuss the film. Thus, people having less about a topic have not the right to discuss this issue and can not be able to make smart comments. Secondly knowing a lot of things about an issue encourages learning the topic more and makes love the topic. Because beauty hides in the details.",When I start to learn about a topic it always seems to me very boring and hard to understand.,0

1907556.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. That is true. That is the way they sell their products, because people always want to buy better products. And the advertisements know it, so they make the products look better to sell them. First, the advertisements have to sell their products, so they try to explain about their products. Then they do not want to tell disadvantages about their products, they just want to tell advantages of them. In the process, they sometimes have to cover the disadvantages. So they tell other people about their products being overly good. And other people believe what they say, and think about what they heard. People will think that the product is really good because they did not hear about its disadvantages. A good looking is tasting good. As for products, it is really important how they look. If they look good, then they seem to work better or taste better than how they are. So when people make the products, they make them look better to cover customer's eyes.","And other people would believe that the products are better than they really are because they are looking good, believing looking good is better than looking bad.",0
1232166.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I have always believed that it is more important for students to understand concepts than it is for them to learn facts. First of all, when one understands something he or she probably remembers this idea for a long time. Instead when one just learns a fact, he or she soon forgetsit. Next, when one understands an idea, it is possible to reuse this idea in similar contexts that sometimes have to be faced during one's life. As Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than Knowledge"", and I think that an undertanding effort stimulates imagination, as well as the ability to infer. Moreover, whenever one understands a new difficult concept, he or she feels a kind of satisfaction and becomes a little more confident. I think that it is important to find out new breakthroughs and the world has always improved thanks to new ideas and discoveries. However, learning facts is important too.",For instance I think that studying history is helpful to avoid errors and mistakes.,0
1547480.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,I agree with this statement because I think that sometimes most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

Although there are many variables and uncertainties that may affect the number of cars, I agree with the statement. First, air pollution is getting more and more serious. In the last century, human beings have made too many cars. In some big cities, the exhaust of cars is the main cause of breath illness. The government also notices that, and it tries to prevent the problem getting worse. One way is to reduce the number of cars. Besides, driving in the rush hour in the city drives all drivers crazy, and it is almost impossible to find a parking space in the down town. The traffic problem in the city also attracts people to go to work by taking public transportation, and gives up their desire to own their cars. The number and quality of public transportation are growing in most countries, and I think it can replace the role of car in the twenty years. Finally, the oil price now has risen about three times as much as three years ago.","The problem will be depleted someday, and people's concern about the problem is reflected in the price now.",0

I think I enjoy my life more than older people. To go somewhere with my friends, to go shopping with my family, to chat with unknown people on the Internet, to find pictures, to find friends, and more whatever. Some of them are needed to young power. Some older people can do these things. But when I become an older person, I think I can't do these things. Because I will lose power. I might be tired early. I know I will become like my thinking. So I have to enjoy my life now. However, older people enjoy their life by using money. They go on big trips, to get houses, and to eat rich foods etc. This enjoyment is different to young people's enjoyment. They want to relax. They won't use such a weapon. I think our feelings of enjoyment and their feelings are different. They enjoy their life, and we enjoy our life the same as the others. If we are enjoying different feelings, I cannot say which is nice, or bad. All people enjoy their life. I think that's very nice. Anyway, I hope to enjoy my older life in the future.

On the contrary, the development of cars will be surprising and momentous. Twenty years can be a long time or a short time, but the development of the quality of cars, including speed, security would be tremendously huge.

1774785.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly disagree that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts. Currently, A lot of people do nt have a lot of time as much as a long time ago. Therefore, time has become very important in our student life. Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example. I saw the information through a diagram of smart people,When some journalist asked a question about how they studied? Most people who made good score people said ""I used to spend a lot of time thinking hard. In my conculsion, Through our life, time becomes the most important thing in our social life.",But currently students have a hard choice between learning more specific information or just knowing the surface information.,0

If a student learns a new thing, she or he would first ask the ideas and concepts of the thing to realize the conditions of the new information. This way always seems more practical to the students. I also would prefer this way, since understanding the main idea by explaining both ideas and concepts would make me understand more easily. Facts are a longer and harder way for most students. Since learning a fact contains many details in itself, it would be more complex for a student. Learning facts also takes a longer period than it does with understanding ideas and concepts.",This is mainly because of its complexity.,0

It is necessary because of illness. When one of the family members becomes ill, she needs a car. That's why an ambulance may not come immediately. However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home. They also don't go out for this reason. Moreover, telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jams. As long as people work these jobs.

In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads. Besides telecommuting and air pollution, cars are expensive because of technology. When we look at the past, cars are more developed than in the past. Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future. Moreover, For instance, I work in a job, but my earnings are not enough to buy a car. Hence, I can not afford to buy the most developed cars. In conclusion, In the future, I think that people don't want to purchase automobiles for these reasons. Therefore, people should prevent these problems.",I consider no cars and no problems for the future.,0
477986.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts. Therefore the amount of money is a very important aspect of human life. Everybody has different points of views about how they must earn the money. Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger.

1156629.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people say that having a variety of knowledge is better, believing that specializing in one specific subject is more desirable. I think that a lot of inventions which enabled our human lives to be more comfortable didn't emerge without specific knowledge offered by some of the brightest scholars. Besides, we can get bigger responsibility and money from specific knowledge. Here is the more detailed illustration below. First, a lot of ingenious scholars who had a great amount of specific knowledge have invented prodigious inventions which make our lives useful. To put it another way, only such people who have deep knowledge can contribute new findings which lead human society to advance. For example, I think people who have broad but shallow knowledge are not capable of inventing the airplane or spacecraft that enabled us to be transported very quickly. This typically shows that specific knowledge or research into one subject is so important for human society's advancement. My second point is that we would benefit from the specific knowledge more than broad and shallow knowledge. In other words, we can get more responsibility and contribute to our society. In some jobs, there is a role that only such a person who has the specific idea, skill or knowledge can play. In those jobs, as only such a person can do, they are to be given bigger responsibility. Moreover, in such a job, we tend to make more money because the number of people who can deal with the task is so small. When people can feel that they have a good responsibility, they contribute to society. and make more money, they are definitely satisfied. This idea clearly teaches me how specific knowledge is important also for an individual person. However, some might say that broad knowledge is also an important factor in living in society.","Of course, when we travel to another country or watch some arts, we had better have a wide idea of it because we will be more impressed.",0

110274.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Whether to be a person who is equipped with plenty of knowledge from all kinds of academic subjects or just to be a professor in one field is not a straightforward issue. Everyone keeps their own opinion on it. While it comes to me, I would say that being a professor is more beneficial. First of all, people should save their energy from obtaining knowledge from all categories of fields, which does good for our advanced education. Energy, just like time for humans, is limited. With this limited energy, one can do what he or she likes to do. But, once distributed too widely, it can't be a professor in a certain field. For example, we know that teachers in the elementary school can teach almost all the courses that are provided. However, if the child grows up and enters college, no one can be responsible for all the classes. What he or she needs is a professor who knows a lot about a particular subject, not a teacher with a lot of knowledge from different subjects.","In addition, people with a great number of knowledge in some special field help solve the social problems.",0

First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate in any activities. There is more stress on their shoulders, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and perform well in school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes.

In my country, specializing in one specific subject is more spread out for the university,and my opinion is parallel with this idea. In terms of universities or in companies,this statement which i agree with is more useful. As an instance of this situation is that in lectures according to a student, taking the course from a person who is specialized in that course is so much more educated than taking it from a person who is not really interested in that course that much. In addition in this way the quality of education is certainly rising. It is also undeniable that in order to graduate from universities you have to be successful all over the lectures that you took.

Someone's priority knowledge of ideas and concepts that students gain is the most important factor in education However, others may say that experiences from facts are an important factor for students. These priorities would depend on everyone's previous life experience. In my case, I grew up in a school that gave me a mixed educational method,and that the method was equally balanced. Since I recognise mixed educational policy, both factors are key to obtaining better concepts, and at least I can say both factors were needed and just one of those would not bring a significant result. When I was an elementary school student, I learned the concept of insects. That was the first time that someone told me a concept. I was engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insects. This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant amount of knowledge even though I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insects. This experience made me realise the importance of understanding ideas brings me more knowledge.

You will have more details about the machine. Students should understand ideas and concepts to learn the facts with more details. Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts.

When people watch television, read newspapers or walk in the street, they see a lot of advertisements. Even though people don't concentrate on that, they already have influenced. The first problem is the company cheats the customers. When the company makes a commercial for selling a product, they usually try to show their products as the best and they tell them only good points. Because they made people believe that products didn't have any defects and customers but it. However, there are also many bad points. It is one of the cheating. The other one is overconsumption. The commercial stimulates people to want to get those products and actually they don't need them, but they buy them. Sometimes buying is caused by developing the economy, but typically it has to disappear. The third reason is cost. If they make an advertisement, they need money and when they make an advertisement that looks better, they have to pay more. It is going to be caused by the increase.

1579748.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Indeed , advertising is one of the best ways to reach people. But some advertisements seem the most time much better than they really are. In my opinion, i agree with this statement for these two reasons:the use of very good commercials and also the use of celebrities in the commercial. First of all , many advertisements have really good commercials which can convince people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of those commercials which want to sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as they get this product they might looklike this person. For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight. Secondly, there is a huge use of celebrities in the advertisements that gives a false image of what a product really is. For instance , the last campaign of Proactiv Solution which is supposed to help to relieve acne. Personally, i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress.

105893.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this statement, actually the most rich people in the world and the biggest managers are people who have taken risks in their lives to become what they are today. Often people are afraid to do things that go out of the ordinary because that may not work and they can find themselves with no jobs any more, no money,they can become a person who is out of society and rejected.","Sometimes i think it is better to listen to our heart and to believe in our self and in our capacities and in our imagination and ability to create because we can be able to succeed even if there are risks to take, Who knows we may be able to do so many extraordinary things if only we were more courageous! On the other hand i think that a person who is always doing the same things at work all his life is not happy,it is such boring to repeat the same things more and more, why can`t we just blow all these annoying works away and realiseour dreams? We most not forgive that we have just one life on this earth so we must take the example of bill gates who is very famous.",0

In my opinion, we can use the internet to do many things, It is more convenient to travel around, and in the city, you can use buses or subway to go to anyplace you want. First of all, we can use the internet to do many things. For instance, people in the feature will work at home and use the internet to do their job. Students don't go to school anymore, because they use the internet to complete the group discussion, or find something about the assignment from a teacher who teaches them through the internet. In addition, it is more convenient to travel around by train or airplane. The train or airplane will be improved. For example, the price of the train and airplane will be very low, Does anyone want to drive by himself or herself or herself? taking the train or airplane is more efficient than driving your own car. Finally, in the city, you can use a bus or subway to go to anyplace you want. If you own a car, you will pay huge taxes on the car, and drive it out a few times. It was a waste of money. the money should be used in other better ways. Furthermore, in japan, they usually go to the train station by bicycle, it is very convenient less polluting , and good for your health.

A generalist is a person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects. A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge of one subject. I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject. A person with broad knowledge in many subjects, a generalist, can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject.

I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part. You should know everything about this part. I want to give an example. If you want to specialize in marketing,you have to know everything about it. You can only be hired in this part of a firm. And if you are not needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked. But if you have knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm. A third advantage of broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things. you can learn new things in all parts of academic life. It would be boring if you did the same things the whole of your life. A broad knowledge gives you the possibility that you can change your work. Your life would be more exciting.

For students who learn the facts ,it will be temporary in their minds. when students understand ideas and concepts it will be inthe mind permanently. Firstly students in the school will follow the process of understanding the ideas and concepts of a particular topic. For example students learning the subjects like Physics ,mathematics , there is a need to understand the ideas and concepts related to the problem or topic. by knowing the concepts and ideas he can these ideas any where in that field. The second reason is that if they practice the same procedure i. e understanding the ideas and concepts related to the topic they may create a history in that field.

I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities. We know that it could be important even for our own future, but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away. we try to keep every thought, every occasion, every second that is going away. and we are not able to stop and think about so important things. We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world. because change happens. but the problem is: will it be better? we don't know. but we will think that we were happy when we were young. because we lived every moment with an excessive intensity! i want to demonstrate what i meant to say. there are about eighty words left. if i had wanted to think i could have written a lot of other things. but now i'm thinking that i'm tired and my lovely friend is downstairs.

669962.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Have you ever an uncomfortable feeling, when you watch the mass media because of news? There is so much news and new information in mass media such as newspapers, TV, radio. Sometimes, we should think about whether it is true or not. Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For the person who wants to know, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point. Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product. For instance, as you know, fast food is not good for your health. However, the companies which produce fast food, they usually hide the fact which can cause problems for the body like cancer. In particular, for children, they can be addicted to fast food because they just see the advertisement which looks delicious. Secondly, the advertisements can advertise the thing in the wrong way, It means the truth can be hidden by force. In illustrative, there are specific rumors about a newspaper company in my country. That is about bad connections between government and newspaper. Actually, nobody doesn't know this fact. but the certain thing is that they usually have good speeches about the government.","In addition, the fact is different depending on the view.",0
1042567.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"These days, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. yes i agree with this. because the main point is they have no interest in helping others. some young people are giving enough time to help their communities. because they are interested in that. but these days young people are interested in going to the cinema whereas to help others. they are spending more time and more money on the enjoyable entertainment. but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends have enough time to help my communities. we spend time doing that when we are free. So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society. The main idea is that we help the community,by seeing our younger friends or any one,they may try to help the community. so that this will be increased by seeing one another. Finally, it supports the community. the help for the community is the main idea of me. because now adays no one is preffering to help others. because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a little bit of selfishness. so that they cant help the community. the young people now a days prefer to enjoy themselves rather than to help the community.",if young people help the community the community will become good.,0

My first point of view will be that if we have all that knowledge in the brain we can be much more cleverer and we won't have to ask our classmates about the problems that we have. We can solve it ourselves. It will be better to do it yourself than ask others because it will be quite embarrassing. You will have to look at others' faces just to wait for their answer and i'll prefer not to do that.

Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study.

114142.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics call I will use the concepts and ideas to get to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts there will be times when they will not help get the solution. In our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very basic example, If my parents want me to go buy vegetables from the vegetable market I will decide which way will be the easier road. I will answer by asking myself using my concepts and not going with the facts. Our human mind can take only some facts and then we have to use the concepts to work towards success.",There are many facts in this world and it will not be in our human abilities to know all the facts.,0

1982981.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In the above paragraph author states that successful people take more resources rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings. so it was flying in the air. The Wrights brothers are different and take more risks to implement an aeroplane. Therefore what i am saying is that the people who are thinking differently from what they already know. If they are thinking similarly about the work. They don't get any new ideas and they do not succeed in that particular work. I conclude that the successful people who already know the work how to do well in that time also have a chance to implement the new things,but they are not thinking in a broader way. the successful people are always trying to implement new things,because they already know how to do the work.",To implement new things it takes more time and enthusiasm to learn the work then only then are they committed to implementing the new things.,0
216699.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago.",The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need.,0

Advertising may make anything better by a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be the fascination towards the product. and looks matter alot. for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you.","which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you.",0

Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers. Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call. Retail giants like walmart and food kings like McDonalds are accessible over short distances. These things virtually eliminate the need to go out,drive and shop. With the advent of the internet, it is very much possible to work from home. With means like video conferencing the members of a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe. E-learning has opened new horizons. Classes and even archives are available online. These things help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest, reducing the need to go out everyday.

780493.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Without questions,I agree with this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do. I have two reasons for this opinion: energy and freedom. First of all, I think that young people are able to exercise harder than older people because they are young, so they have a lot of energy in general. In my grandfather's case, he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even huge things when he was 21 years old. Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured himself when he was in junior high-school. I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster and play some sports when you are 70 years old. Secondly, I claim that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think. It is because older people have their husbands or wives in many cases. Of course, if you are young and not married, you can have a boyfriend or girlfriend freely. While it may be true that not every young person can fall in love with someone, and older people tend to have more money than young people.","However, young people are given freedom.",0

1082317.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior. Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession. Another reason ,I believe that taking risks and trying new things brings success because it brings creativity in a person which leads to success in life. When we try new things in life then our brain works faster and we feel more challenging. Anil Ambani is the biggest example.",He had a creative mind who always tried to do something new and take risks.,0
1113295.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In our century, advertising is everywhere. We have to deal with and to be aware of advertising's tricks.

That is why they are ready to say everything which can convince you to buy it. People who do advertising have not the due to say the truth, their goal is only commercial, not educative.","So how can we trust advertising? To illustrate this fact, we can take the example of Mc Donalds.",0
535556.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"After recapturing the experience in my life i found both understanding and learning the concepts are useful but understanding the ideas and concepts more useful and scientific. I found understanding of concepts more beneficial in many fields and ways because by understanding the idea we know how to apply it easily and effectively. for example in solving a physics problem if you understand the concept you can do it easily and accurately in a few minutes compared to others. another example if we understand a surgical procedure thoroughly we can perform it with fewercomplications. Understanding the concept also makes us remember the concept for a long time. for example i still remember the dissection of a frog which i learned in my school days because i understood the steps of dissection well. another example is that regadding the different process that takes place in the human digestive system. Analysis of the subject is increased when we understand the concept ,this can be supported with the example of apersonal experience regarding the case which i saw in the hospital i found the symptoms of the disease could diagnose a tough case easily. I was able to do so only because i had a better understanding of the subject. Understanding the subject also increases our depth and the command of the subject for example in organic chemistry we should deepen the concept in order to judge the correctreaction.","Thus, with the correct understanding of concept is essential for all these things to occur.",0
1719460.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue. Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more. Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future. They become more selfish. To sum up, given the reasons above discussion, I agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Because they are educated more selfishly, most of them concerned themselves more than others. In addition, they prefer to the other noticeable things to make their life more exciting and interesting. Meanwhile, they don't have enough opportunities to get in touch with their communities. They lack connections and interactions between families, schools and communities.",And that's the reason.,0
1598284.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts? By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information. Huge topics and their contents can be covered in a minimum of time. But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned it. If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they really know it and will not forget it as quickly as they would if they just learnt it without understanding. So both sides have their positive and negative arguments. The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand. Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not really understand or would you be better off with some information you can handle and understand? Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just too huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it. So one should not concentrate on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) and one should not just learn facts.",You would not know what to do with them.,0

Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other people think that the better one is to specialize in one specific subject. First of all having a knowledge of many subjects does not mean having lots of essential things. People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use them together. Because those are different things. But when people are taking some research into similar subjects it can help them with lots of things. Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas. Because of that people can prefer this way. Secondly specializing in one specific subject can be more acceptable to everyone. When people are interested in one subject they can continue with this material and they can be a professor. And also if a person knows everything about a subject they also have learned some different things. People who have a knowledge of a specific subject have a more successful life than others who have none. So they earn more money than others do. To sum up i agree with the idea which was mentioned because of the facilities of board knowledge.,Knowing lots of things can get a number of opportunities which can help us in our social or daily life.,0

Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life.

1881808.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First, I think they can succeed because they have already taken their risk, it is all risk out side the world, each thing has a risk but seems to big or small. For example, if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be an accident on you. Taking risks is a must. The mean of success is they know how to do things well, A human being has a tendency to learn more to find out new things.","Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve.",0
1206804.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,The department I am currently studying has a policy to encourage all the students to specialize in finance or marketing. The logic behind it is that you can not make smart choices if you have less and broad knowledge in a specific topic. I totally agree with the idea that focusing is better. Because I believe that you can not talk or make comments about every topic in the world and specializing encourages you to learn more and makes you love the topic more.,Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details.,0

1955440.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. To sell a product, it has to have good promotion, advertisements sell the product because while showing the promotion of the product, the y are showing the best product ever, when sometimes it's just a big lie and sometimes it's the truth. The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market. There is a background behind a product, and belonging to a company. The product that is already on sale has an enormous study before getting to the store. Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time they pass through, by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about.","The best way to sell could be by improving your product just by very tiny changes like making the product wantable, but not changing the product, just making people interested, curious and this will make people buy the product, this is a great way of doing a sell.",0

1357482.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. First, we always choose the same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to the supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys the same snack. One day, I asked him, "" Why do you choose the same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watch this snack's commercial on television, then I think that this snack tastes good, so I always choose this one. ""I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he is influenced by television commercials , so he always chooses the same snack. Second, we always believe in the content of commercials. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food. My father asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy expensive natural food? ""My sister answered,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food. ""However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there was a lot of value in her natural food, but it was the same as normal food. She was influenced by the advertisement that included her book. Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercials, radio commercials, magazines, books, newspapers, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show the correct information. The meaning of an advertisement is to sell a lot of goods, so when we buy any good, we should research a lot of information, and we should ask for opinions from family or friends. If we can collect a lot of information, we can choose the correct good. I think that correct information is more important than influence by advertising.","Before we choose good, we should remember this thing.",0
1011356.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening.",Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life.,0
102297.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I recently read an article about supporting groups, which have to face the situation of very low activity participation rates among their members and lack of new applications. Since I also lead a supporting group for keeping our city park clean, I can confirm this tendency and I agree with the statement. I can't stop asking why young people don't want to be involved in activities, which can improve the quality of life in their community. Lack of time is the first most popular answer. Nowadays youngsters are very busy: if the school doesn't give them enough homework, parents will find some extra - curricularactivities. Friends are also important, and something done with them seems to them to have more worth than something done for the community. Helping the community brings not only benefits to the community itself, but also to those who participate in the activity.",Staying together is essential for a social animal like the human being.,0

328782.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think there are no miracle solutions to be successful but we can do the best to achieve this objective. I totally agree with people who say that you must take many risks to plan a successful career. For example, if you want to open a restaurant, you must risk a part of your own money to have sufficient funds to buy all the equipment a restaurant needs. If you don't want to take this risk, you'll never open your restaurant. But only taking risks will not guarantee a successful career, I think you must be innovant to achieve this objective. By doing only what you can do, you'll never progress because you don't try to experiment with a new type of work and I think successful people are in constant progress to be the most competitive in their field of activity. And if they fail in a project, they can totally change their activity because they are more adaptable. So experimenting with new things is very useful to have success because the world is changing every day and it will not adapt to you, you will adapt to it. Imagine a grocery which only sells apples.","If apples disappear on the earth's surface, he has two solutions.",0
98215.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I do not agree with this statement. I think there are a lot of young people that help his community and spend a lot of their time on it. For example there are some volunteers in many places: in hospitals, in centers for old people. and so on. I know some people who work for the ambulance: they are volunteers who stay, some times also all night, at the ambulance to give their help in case of need, and the day after they are in office to work. There are also some girls I know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they seek or need help. These girls have a big sense of responsibility for helping others, I think. Moreover, my cousin is always around the community of her church (she is very religious) to give her help to guide and educate children. In her blood and heart there is the force to do this. She tells me she feels much better when she helps the neighbours. I talked about some people I know, but I didn ` t say anything about myself. That`s why I have never done anything for my community. This is because I ` ve never had the occasion, or because I don`t think I would be able to give help without anythingin change. I think that they are very admirable people who do this, but also that you must feel it. I could give some time to my community for example cleaning natural parks when the community of my town organizes an eventcleaning the city. but I am sure I will forget it or I will decide to do something else that day. that`s why really I don`t feel it is my time to give my time to the community.",I`m not a good person like my friends.,0
504053.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is important or learning the facts. Because every thing in our life ca not be understood through the ideas and concepts that need more creative minds. firstly when we talk about ideas and concepts these are sometimes easy to understand but some times very typical to understand. And this also depends on the type of mind that the student has. and understanding ideas and concepts also depends on the way we have brought in our life. because if a student is restricted to certain things in his childhood then he ca not have a creative mind. and if everything is understood through ideas then there will be a more number of scientists than normal people on the earth. And the other thing we have to talk about is learning facts that is learning throughexperiences. and everything we cant experience because if we think wearing a helmet can be implemented after facing any problem then its just like taking a chance in our life. and every thin cant be learned through facts because every thing cant be a fact in our life.,because it is difficult to get every thing as a fact.,0
398389.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Maybe learning facts is important for students. But I think if they understand ideas and concepts, they will get facts, too. I think understanding ideas and concepts is easier to understand, instead of just learning facts. When I study biology, and history in English, my tutor always gives me examples, and ideas. And it is always helpful to me, and I will never forget about it. For foreign language students, the ideas and examples are helpful. Because they could not understand English well as Americans do, they could not just learn facts from books. So, the ideas or concepts are very important to them to learn facts. To understand ideas and concepts is more fun to do. If students get ideas, concepts, and examples from the picture, they can understand more clearly. To draw pictures or diagrams, students will have fun in the class.",It is like a laboratory in the biology class.,0
520764.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people. Some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide, they think that it is more quiet and peaceful. As for me, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. But I disagree with considering it as the best way to travel. First, most people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel. In some scenarios, it may be very dangerous for travelers. For example, if you travel alone in a forest where modern technology can not be used to communicate with the outside world. Imagine if you missed your way in the forest, met some dangerous animals or got injured by accident, how would you continue your journey. In this situation, it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide. Your friends can help you if there are really some bad things happening. And since there is a tour guide, the opportunity to experience some bad things may decrease. So you can totally enjoy your trip without always worrying about all kinds of situations. second, common sense tells us that human beings are social animals. So for most people, they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone. Imagine, you and your friends on a trip , you can talk about some funny things, you can share some feelings, or play card with your friends. People in groups will make you travel more interesting, you have more things to do. However, if you travel alone without a tour guide, you are deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends. However, I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Because modern society provides us with many opportunities to choose. Some people can choose to travel the other way by their own option. But I recommend them to prepare enough and gather materials about their travel route carefully to resist potentially dangerous events that may happen to them. So, generally, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide as a very good way to travel. Since, you may get more pleasures. And the travel is safer for you.",But I think that travelling in other ways is still a good way for some people to prepare well.,0

1591119.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I think that this statement is a real view of today's life of young people and not only. Because the first reason for this problem is that today , young people have not too much time to spend with their real friends and so don't have time to help their communities. Today these boys always have the same size of work at home for the school assignment , but when this is finished , they start to play with the computer or to do something similar. In this situation they have only a little time to try to help a community , but in this time they think about other things. These communities , i think that may be helped by everybody , also in daily life but with today's life , with only the money at the center of everything , only a few people there are that think about them.","Now , infact , there is changing in the life not only of young people , daily work is different also for the time that it has in a day , with a lot of people working from the early morning to the start of evening , so they may try to help the communities only at the weekend if they don't work.",0

For example, if you do not know the concept of ""evaporation"" how are you going to know the ""process of raining"" or maybe understand some chemical process that involves the concept of ""evaporation"". Secondly, I agree that students must know every concept of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challenges without knowing the facts. For example, if a student knows the concept of ""bowling something"" , then it would be easier for him to cook something by just following the instruction.

I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities. We know that it could be important even for our own future, but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away. we try to keep every thought, every occasion, every second that is going away. and we are not able to stop and think about so important things.","We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world.",0

From my experience, I agree with the travel in a group led by a tour guide for some economical and exciting reasons. Firstly, I like to travel in groups led by a tour guide because I can save more money and time. A tour guide is professional enough to give us more information suited to the places that we want to travel to. In addition, a tour guide needs to compete with other agencies, and it tries to give more benefits to its clients. A tour guide also has a lot of experienced information about what I want to travel, so it is kind to consult her to give information. The more important reason for agreeing is that we enjoy much more than traveling with several people for themselves. We can have a chance to socialise with a lot of new people.

The two types of people might consider different factors in their living environment that will guide them to the best succeeding path or way. People who like to take risks, their surrounding environment forces them or encourages them to take the risks.

1750239.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this idea but taking risks can also lead you into failure. One thing is certain, if one does not take initiative, one will have a very boring life. A risky life is an adventurous life. That's why it will be sometimes very hard to face some hardships but ordeals are unfortunately part of the thriving process. Besides a man who has taken a lot of risks in his life is commonly called an experienced man and God knows that experience is a very important factor. History also illustrates very well that most of the successful people have always been determined people who believed in what they wanted to achieve. However, you can analyze this question and take a more philosophical approach. First of all we have to define successful people as geniuses who have managed to express their own interpretation of life.","Unlike ordinary people, artists and scientists are not cowardly since they accept their challenge which consists in the main lines in a creation work which has not been done by anyone else before them.",0
336929.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"When asked about what kind of knowledge is good for a person's life. Many people may hold the issue to learn as much as specialized knowledge in one specific subject and think that is a prime argument. But, some people, however, are taking a fresh look at it. As far as I am concerned, I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic  subjects, although there may be several merits to specializing in one specific subject, for example, more expertized and more deeply knowledge. Among countless reasons that influence my opinion, there are three conspicuous aspects that follow. We may look into every possible reason, however, the foremost one is that broad knowledge is good for fitting into the development of the world today. Nowadays, people can get as much information from many different methods. They should have the ability to be familiar with huge amounts of information and treat it correctly. And if they want to reach that level mentioned above they must have a lot of different knowledge of a great number of subjects.","Also, it may be arbitrary to judge my preference only by using the argument mentioned in the above paragraph.",0
1216752.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes for most people. When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strict schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone. As to me, my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it. Suppose, I plan to visit a historical place, which is relevant to my subject, and even most people do not know it, I may have to go there alone. On the contrary, if my destination is Yellow Stone park, I would like to join a group, so I can communicate with other members. In addition, money is another factor, which can affect my decision. On the one hand, if you have enough money, I prefer to go there alone because I have more flexibility.","On the other hand, if the buffet is limited, I would like to share some costs with others, then I will choose a group to join.",0

Better physical conditions are good references to make young people enjoy life. Most young young people know that they have a better physical condition than the olders. A young person generally knows that he or she has an undeformed body related to most of the olders and finds himself or herself strong enough to perform a different job. For example they can play football whenever they want but the olds can not. Youngers can also try new and dangerous sports which make them feel excited. Younger people know that their age is an advantage to be in a good manner. Being a young person I know I have a bigger chance to live more than the elderly and that sometimes motivates  me. Before starting a hard job I know I can deal with that job as long as I want.","If I face difficulties, I can spare bigger time for my job.",0

That means that the population growths also in the ""first world countries"" so more people will be able to reach a car.

524381.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities. However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet.","Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day.",0

However, in the future that is portrayed as more speedy and comfortable than nowadays in some movies, we may discard our cars and the cars will be just a huge waste of time. There are some reasons to explain this opinion. These days are changing and developing faster than in thepast. Some people have already visited out of earth, and lots of satellites are being thrown on the earth. Instead of using cars, they will move away by their personal flying like a plane or themselves. From the past, many people have wanted to fly to the sky and they finally made an airplane. The more wishes make more developments.

876354.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide. When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do. But any group in this situation would be disappointed. Finally, there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone, you are not alone. It means that going on a trip alone allows you to make friends. For instance, I went to Japan when I was a freshman at university. I had been travelling for a month. I could not speak Japanese fluently on that tour, I could make friends - Nakasaki, Murama, and Yorisimo. It was an unforgettable experience. When you are with your fellows, you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends.","As I mentioned above, I don't like traveling in a group led by a.",0

Young people nowadays have different tasks to do from the people who were young in the past. Today life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different to those 20 years ago. A young person has to go to college or university, maybe he has to work if he wants to pay for his studies or other activities. The free time is not a lot, so when a student is free, he usually goes out with his friends and to think about enjoying activities like going to a disco or listening to music.

911530.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Everyone in this life wants to live more so I think that we should enjoy our time living our lives. So I agree that young people enjoy their life more than older people. We know that when we are young we enjoy our time playing , studying and doing alot of things we cannot donow. There are several reasons for that , one reason is that , when we were children we had the freedom to do any things we needed ,also we had the power to live a happy and interesting lifestyle , we could be late for hours. Moreover, we had the health and the desire to reach what we need , we could go for playing, singing with our friends , but when we get older we cannot do these things because we have new responsibilities in our life, such as our children and the care which they need to become like their parents. also , our power to enjoy our time became weak and we could not have the ability to work and enjoy ourselves, so we should let our children have this entertainment and let them live their life , because when we are our age we did alot of things which reminds me now. So you should live your life by having some exciting and enjoyment.","All in all , we cannot stop time , and we should convince ourselves in our destiny and fait , we must imagine our selves as we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our lives , and this will not prevent us from trying to complete our lives by thinking about the history which we have lived through from the young.",0

1818765.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible. It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius. To sum up, the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things. But its maybe the most important thing to realise that all human beings are different.",As we all have different abilities and unabilities.,0
758953.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"No, i disagree, that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject Specialization is highly preferred according to me because knowledge is like anocean. What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean,so it is impossible to pursue in many acedamics. The better way is to take a single subject. We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field. He gets the skills of innovation , works hard ,and tries to concentrate on his subject. since he is free to choose the subject of interest he will pursue with zeal and eagerness. He will be more clear about his future plans. There was a saying that"" jack of all,master of none"". this surely happens if someone enters into too many academic institutions. the main reason people forget one if they learn another. if a person enters many fields there is a chance of confusion and they end up in a mess. researchers also conveyed that people concentrating on different subjects can not gain anything. the more you go the less you will learn.",according tomy opinion it is better to master a single subject than to make all the stuff included in the brain.,0

854456.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,In my sense it is better to specialize in one specific subject in a globalised renovative and inventive world namely in today's world as an exper in a specific subject. Twentieth and these centuries have been the leading centuries in technological enhancement and progress. so much information is being circulated so fast that sometimes it is very difficult to follow up on the developments. In this environment it is more useful and efficient for a person to specialise in a specific topic and improve himself in this field. To me we have to specialize since this is the only way to go in this century. Just giving an example you can not go to a doctor specialised in heart illnesses for a headache you are suffering. The very broad range of fields in medicine requires doctors to specialize in one of those fields. We can consider this requirement for all of the other sciences namely social sciences mathsetc.,While you have the opportunity to examine details from many aspects of views in one subject It is very hard to do this if you care about all matters.,0

""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time.

In my country, specializing in one specific subject is more spread out for the university,and my opinion is parallel with this idea. In terms of universities or in companies,this statement which i agree with is more useful. As an instance of this situation is that in lectures according to a student, taking the course from a person who is specialized in that course is so much more educated than taking it from a person who is not really interested in that course that much. In addition in this way the quality of education is certainly rising. It is also undeniable that in order to graduate from universities you have to be successful all over the lectures that you took. This already means that when you have finished your school you already have broad knowledge of the department you have joined.",Shortly this separated education involves so much inefficient for the rest of the life of the students.,0
1071263.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this opinion. I think, in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. I have some reason to think about that. First, some companies are now inventing new cars, like hybrid cars, electric cars something like that. Actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes. We are also interested in cars that are good for the environment. The car industry will change their way of selling the car to customers. Of course, I think of the customer for the environment of the earth will change in this few years. Second, I think that physical translation is not convenient in countryside. For me, I live in the country side, I can not ride on the bus or train when I want. It is different between the big cities like Tokyo and small cities. So people who live in the country side, they use their own car now. I also use my own car. The number of cars in countryside has increased more than before. But on the other hand, now gasoline is so expensive. If this situation continues, the number of cars may decrease. I imagined that reason. But, I think if the cost of gasoline is expensive, the bus company will change the timetable so as not to move out. That is why, people will have to use their own car.",Japanese companies like Honda and Toyota are famous in many other countries.,0

By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented java,we can't understand the features ofjava. we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts. facts can also Improve knowledge. By studying the facts like Independence we should know about the great leaders of our country ,and we should know about how they will work hard for Independence. History will tell about this. So learning the facts was Important. By studying the facts the children can learn about the honesty, reliability , and history of the country. Everyone should know about the history of the country. By learning the facts we can prevent wars like the second world war and the first world war. by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods, It was very interesting. last week some of the people found the Dwaraka under the sea, so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were Dwaraka in the past.

Now I am not anymore interested in playing music or doing mathematics exercises so I am naturally going to specialize in what I like. Thus I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. First of all, I really want to know more about a subject which really interests me, namely the Economists.

In case you understand the idea or concept of the building, you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings. In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind. In this essay I want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas. Firstly, you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea. In case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim. Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea. Secondly, you are able to improve the concept. If you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable. Just think of the Eiffel Tower which had for the first time an iron staircase. People transferred this knowledge to other buildings and increased the size step by step! Lastly, by understanding the concept it is easier to keep in mind the facts. You are then able to understand why diesel engines need less fuel than engines with gas because they use different techniques.",From my point of view it is really important to understand the concept of something.,0
582854.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think that this is the main key point in the new economic society; but it's very hard to conclude a general idea about how to have success. In this case the question is very limited, and regards only the complete or uncomplete people's knowledge background for their ownsuccess. In my opinion is impossible that people can achieve success only with knowledge , but in necessary a mix of the various elements that make it possible this; is more possible than one personn't that hasn't particular the ,, economics skills, one success than one very person skills without any skills in the economic world. But it is also true that knowledge consists in a principal help for the aim of success. For the first successful people must tend to the risks, because without the risk can't have what you want; the risks are proportionated to the result that can be had if the new things that finish in a good result. Obviously this doesn't mean that for having success it is sufficient to take some risks, because this can have a dramatic consequence complete contrary to success, in the words of this this means losing everything. For a good final result the risks must be used with knowledge about how and when the risks are possible to use.",Infact is necessary to know when one risks can be had or not in relation to the thought that it is related.,0
263612.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right. Take math for example, during my high school days, I had to answer lots of questions. A math teacher explained the concepts first, and then made us answer questions. If I could understand the concepts, it was not difficult to answer the questions. So when I studied other subjects such as chemistry and physics etc. I applied the same method, that is, understanding the concepst, first. Here is another example. In terms of parenting, especially money related, I think good parents are not the people who can give big money to their children but teach them how to make money. You might think this is a different story, but it is related to the topic, I think. All parents want their children to be successful and rich. But there are types of parents. One just tells their children how they made money, and instructs them to do something to make money without explaining what the concepts behind the facts are. Another type wants to explain what is important and more important. They know that facts will change, yet if you can understand the concepts behind the facts, you can improvise to any circumstances.

The other example is a soccer player who is Ronaldo. If Ronaldo did not try new skills, could he become a world star and get the love of fans? These questions are based on my opinion that will be explained. Do you know the proverb that ""No pain, No gain""? It is the best sentence for me in my whole life.

1748079.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","This is a very diplomatic statement to say that the use of cars will decrease in the future. As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them. In this fast growing society, cars do play a major significant role, as they do be very helpful for quicker transportation, because time once lost cannot be regained, and for the world twenty years from now, time will play a very prominent role. There are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars, which would become a major resource for growing the usage of cars in the future. By using this type of car, they have many advantages like the faster mode of transportation, which not only improves one's only status but improves the whole economic development of the country.

I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types.

Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in.

112005.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"". In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation. Due to gravity whatever things are thrown in the air from theearth's surface will fall on the earth again because of the gravitational pull of the earth. If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from the earth will fall back to the earth's surface,then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason why. Due to this type of learning none of the students will become good engineers or any other professionals.",Because of lack of concepts and practical knowledge.,0

There are three opinions in my mind to talk about why i disagree with this statement. At the beginning of the statement, I think one of the important reasons that people can be successful is because successful people have already done this thing as they are successful ,they use more time than other people , they continue their work all day , not give it up,so they are successful. It is not too easy to be successful for every successful person. Second, successful people do the same as other people. They just have more experiences than other people , At this time, they would have many experiencesto fair when they do this thing but nobody knows it. Successful people are not cleverer than other people,only harder working than other people. Third, new things not only have already been tried to , they need more time to think and to get some information to find some notes about them,successful people can not try new things when they have not already. Therefore, they change some opinions which they already know how to do well. It is too bad for successful people.","All of them can tell us successful people the same as other people, although they are successful people, they are not always successful in their lives.",0

Most of the students understand the idea so that they can do things better and get a grip on that particular idea and also they can learn more things about the idea they learnt.,"For example a student preparing for his exams is coming over in a few days, to get rid of that he must read properly so that he does not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need to mug up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam.",0

First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better.","Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions.",0
780493.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Without questions,I agree with this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do. I have two reasons for this opinion: energy and freedom. First of all, I think that young people are able to exercise harder than older people because they are young, so they have a lot of energy in general. In my grandfather's case, he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even huge things when he was 21 years old. Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured himself when he was in junior high-school. I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster and play some sports when you are 70 years old. Secondly, I claim that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think.",It is because older people have their husbands or wives in many cases.,0

I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories.

112298.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"We all pass by difficult moments in our lives that will help us gain experience. I agree with the quote that says ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"", for many different reasons. A person who tries new things in his life, will gain experience and knowledge. Taking risks and learning new things will develop a person emotionally and physically. It is a good thing for a person to be adventurous, and go through different kinds of situations, because it helps him learn new things and lessons in life. By learning these new lessons, and by being more experienced, a person will suddenly see himself optimistic,and happy. His reason for living will increase, because he will love life more, and would like to do new stuff that will entertain, and teach him. I think that a risk taker is a very confident person, who knowswhat he wantsin life, and he is lucky to have this characteristic. It is a positive action that each person must choose to succeed in life, unlike the people that only do what they know. These people that are not risk takers will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life. They will regret not being risky, and not doing and trying everything new in life, and will hope and wish for time to go back, and do whatever they did not do. The difference between these two kinds of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new things and lessons in life, while the other is being self- -reliant , scared, and lazy, and he will not succeed in life as much as the confident, risk taker.","In conclusion, taking risks will never affect a person in a negative way.",1

Consequently, few people nowadays think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. On the other hand, there are still people who think that the facts are more important for students to learn. In my opinion, i think learning facts is more important than the others, which means i disagree with the topics And I will list my reasons as follows. First, the most benefit of learning facts. It is that people are living in the world all filled with facts.","Both commonsens and our experience have informed us that the more facts we have learned, the stranger we are.",1

1712367.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The environmental concerns we know nowadays such as the melting of the ice cap or the thickness of the ozone layer make us wish that there would be less pollution in the future. This result could be reached thanks to a breakdown in the use of cars, which pollute a lot because of exhaust gases. However, I do not think that in twenty years the use of cars will be less important because cars bring us the comfort that no other way to travel can equalize. First of all, cars are very comfortable. Thanks to them, we can go quite fast wherever we like. Nowadays, in every country in the world there are concrete roads which enable us to travel by car. This is a common point of all Earth citizens. Moreover, it is a private place. It belongs to you as your flat or house does. Consequently, you can adapt it to your tastes and make it look as you want. For instance, we can often see cars painted with funny colours or with a lot of sticks on the windows. You can also decide whether to clean it or not, whether to allow pets to get in, whether to listen to music loudly or not. On the contrary it is impossible to act this way on public transport like buses. You have to bear people attitude even if you disagree with it. Finally, I reckon that only environmental concerns can prevent people from using their cars which would have been replaced by eco-friendly buses for example. However developing countries can not afford and implement such progress.","So, inhabitants of developed countries won`t agree to give up their cars' comfort while people in developed countries still take advantage of it.",1
1905287.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"From my point of view, young people enjoy their life more than people do. First off, confronted with fewer responsibilities than the grown-ups, they have plenty of time to enjoy life. Thus, They just see the nice side of it. Indeed, young people are usually neither married, nor parents. Moreover, they do have parents who care for them and pay for them when they need.","On the contrary, older people are less looked after and a part of their family is dead.",1
1877755.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statement. People try things that they don't know very well. The risk is a part of life and many people believe that this is the only thing to carry on living. I think it's very sad. The quotidianity is also very important and to appreciate small things in each day is an other way to live. This statement can have negative effects on people's lives. The teenagers often try things that are very dangerous to be appreciated by other members of a group. They take risks only to be part of something. They don't hear what their parents tell them and they do what kind of stupid things. They drive a car at high speed, for example.

While at school students learn a number of facts and ideas. The huge academic syllabus is a combination of both facts and ideas. However the point that needs to be focussed on here is, "" How much do students remember afterall? ""They remember only what they learn and not what they mug up. Therefore we can sum up as it is important to grasp concepts while at school rather than merely registering facts and forgetting them later on.

562635.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements are the most common and colorful part of our lives in the 21st century. Everyday another selection for a material is made or invented and coming to our TVs or newspaper pages to show us his advantages. people have different ideas about the issue that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Some think that it is right others think that it is a wrong way of thinking. I'm personally agree with the first ones. First of all, advertisements make the products seem bigger. Every advertisement is a little circus show to make you believe that 'this one' is the 'one' that you have been looking for since your childhood. To make you believe they will try every method, especially do not believe in the size of the product on the television. For example last year a newspaper began to promote a tape.

People are very talented and they are inventing different types of new things,that we have never seen before. These successful people are very interesting people because their thoughts are amazing, unpredictable. Because they have great talent,good knowledge in their work,and mainly the strong ability to do the work at any cost time. They are very energetic to find new things.

685492.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is quite difficult. There are three points to discuss about this question. The first point is that having broad knowledge can help you in finding a job because as much as you know as varied can be the fields in with you can deal with. Moreover you will be able to take part in a variety of subjects with people and this can help you to socialise when you are in a new environment with people you don't know. Third, you can link different information and create a personal point of view. On the other hand, specializing in a certain subject can help you to become a leader in your job field and an expert. Furthermore you can speak deeply about your subject in a conversation, and you can use it to appeal to people who listen to it and make a strong impression. Finally, you can teach or give specific information to other people in a conversation helping them to understand new matters far away from their fields of interest. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge and I am quite sure that broad knowledge is better than specific knowledge. My experience teaches me this. I attended Social and political studies at university and this is a very broad knowledge course. :Later in life it has been really useful in my job, in understanding the world and making me flexible in learning new tasks. For all these reasons, I think it can be helpful in daily life and for yourself as a human being.","In the end, I think one must stop learning in life, I would like to continue to study the subjects i like and learn new ones that can help me to be a better person.",1
1032060.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"""Innovation is the mother of success "" I strongly support the prompt that successful people try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Surely,success comes to those who try new things. ""Risk is another name for success. ""If one takes the risk of investing in a new business then two conditions take birth. The first one is that he will earn profit for himself which is a positive aspect of the risk taken. But on the other hand there is equal probability of his failure which is a negative aspect. In my opinion,both of them can't be stated as success. Because real success is to learn from failure and then hit your target again,but this time with full preparation and timing. Then I am sure that the person will not lose again. This implies that a person learns from his failure. Yes, I agree that,success comes to those who try new things and with proper planning. But its not only trying new things without even pondering over them. If a person takes a risk to gamble then its his luck that will win one time or two but its not that he will win. Its just a waste of money andtime. So risk should be taken in the right direction. It should not be in a vague direction. Let's have an example of the great industrialist of India Late DhiruBhai Ambani, founder of Reliance Group.

Advertisement fosters instant consumption, and a lot of companies adapt famous actors and actresses with expensive model payments. I n addition, through an advertisement, people don't think which product is good or not. To begin with, advertising fosters instant consumption. When I came to New-york, I was really interested in the Victoria Secret advertisement, which made me buy a lot more of its products even if I had lots of outerwear already. I could not say that the advertisement was the worst thing for me. What is more, a lot of companies adapt famous actors and actresses with expensive payments. Even though, the price of the product is pretty cheap, we have to pay its advertisement fare invisible. we would pay a more expensive price,considering the quality of the product.

Someone who really understands the roots of things is better trained as he can shape things based on the fundamental knowledge he has. On the contrary, a student who only learns the facts and does not understand the principle or concept will at any time apply what he has learnt but will be inefficient in a general case. This last can never shape things or invent new things as he does not have the capability of thinking by himself.

Of course, this is an effective way to reduce the use of cars. Now it is, and it will be. Secondly, people are going to be concerned about the environment.

1112819.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that people who want to be success should try new things and take risks rather than only doing the regular things. The first reason is we can not get more success from the regular things. If the things we already know how to do well, then there is nothing we need to do. It's hard to do them better. Then why not try a new thing or take a risk? Normal people always use the regular ways to deal with ordinary things. So they can not achieve success. Let's see the successful people, almost all of them begin with trying new things or taking risks. The first step to being successful is to try it, to take a risk.",The second reason is that people will always be successful from trying new things and taking risks.,1
76547.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Cars! cars are one of the most used vehicles today and they lead to a better lifestyle and comfort for a lot of people. On the other hand there are a lot of negative aspects that are involved in the use of cars and people argue about the existence of cars. Will there be more or fewer cars in twenty years? To discuss that topic we have to look at events all around the world. Daily newspapers write about pollution and about the effects that occur from cars. People will have to consider our environment even more in the future and they really have to be aware of the risks when polluting the earth. Another point often mentioned in headlines is the one that new energy sources, which will be able to run an engine are found and prepared for future use. Meanwhile some scientists believe that there will be enough oil to support cars for the next century others think that oil is a very scarce resource and there wont be enough oil to provide all cars. Another point that has to be taken into consideration is that streets not only are overcrowded but also cause the government to spend a lot of money to repair them. Surely some of that money will be collected by taxes from street-users such as car drivers but there has to be further consideration. On the other hand there are reasons to make one think that there will be more cars in the future. For example there is the growing population especially in china or asia where a lot of people nowadays drive bicycles, but as soon as they can afford cars will buy a car.",That means that there are might regions where more cars will be built to satisfy one s wishes considering the habitable planet population is not growing that fast anymore and therefore there is no need for more cars.,1

Advertisements are produced to promote a product and to make it sell better. So what do we do if we want people to buy our product? We try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market, which is maybe not true, but people need to believe it to choose our product. That is the reason why many advertisements make it seem their products are much better than they actually are. In our every day lives we are confronted with many examples. My favourite examples are the washing powder advertisements on television. Wouldn't it be wonderful to put your clothes in the washing machine and when taking them out again, all the ugly stains are gone and the clothes look newer than before? I have tried several times, but it just does not work. So there the advertisements definitely make the washing powder much better than it is. Another product which has to be incredible according to the advertisement, are energy bars for sports.","You do not only get an unhuman power and condition, but the bar turns your outer appearance into an athlete's body.",1

Even though it is kind of a school homework, every student helps their communities by visiting old people who do nt have any relatives, or orphanages and some of them really feel pleased to help them. Furthermore, in Korea, when students attend universities they try to participate more actively because they can have more free time than before. Not everybody but lots of my friends are volunteering to teach elementary to high school students who are not available to have a tutor without receiving money.

Thanks to this starting improving the car has become a common means of transportation. In fact, a production less expensive has permitted us to reduce the price to buy a car and more people can have the possibility to buy one.

1310455.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I kind of disagree with this statement. I agree that understanding ideas and concepts are important, but learning facts is also important. By understanding ideas and concepts students learn how facts take place. It is not just once you understand ideas, you do need to worry about how facts happen. For example, my professor explained the process of the earthquake. She briefly described each and every detail about it. Now i know how an earthquack happens, but what if i do not know the facts of it. How can i prove my concept of the earth quack, if i do not have a specific example. If i said that there are earthquack happen in indonesia, and explain these are the reasons this happens over there more often, then i support my statement. My facts support my concept and ideas. The  happening of the earthquake in indonesia is a fact. I need to know it to understand my concept better. Facts are important in order to understand the concept. You can not say that fact does not worth it. Without fact no concept and no idea take place. Facts are the life of concepts. One more example here is that countries in the southern hemisphere have a warmer climate and countries in the northern hemisphere have a cooler climate. How can i prove this statement? I will give all my geographical reasons and explanation. How can I prove all my geographical reasons?

188065.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Industrial engineering is a profession having a broad area that has become more popular in our country recently. It is thought that studying everything a little is better than specializing in one area. However in my opinion it is not a good idea. Firstly, people with a broad range of interests can not learn and use everything well. It is obvious that human beings have a capacity and this can be only enough for some extend. Specializing on a specific subject makes it possible to use all your effort for it. Hence you will be more powerful in that area. Secondly, studying everything may be useful for someone to see the big picture and see some problems easier. however fixing the problems usually needs to be an expert. For example knowing accounting and computer programming may help you to define a problem in the accounting software, but only a software expert can fix it. Lastly, think about the inventions that are really essential for our life. For example electricity, engines, computers, and so on. All of these are a product of long training on a certain subject. This process is an increasingly learning process and it does not have an end. Hence, people should use all their effort to achieve the point that they can achieve.","In conclusion, it may be said that having broad knowledge is better to find the problems or something else.",1
112715.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts. The reason is that understanding ideas and concepts is more creative activity for students. When we try to understand the ideas and concepts, we must consider lots of factors of ideas and concepts. First we must confirm whose ideas or concepts they are, to add more information to them as the backgrounds. Next, we make an analysis of why they have the ideas or the concepts using acquired background information. After these practices, we can approach the stage to make answers or own opinions. To get answers or opinions, students can have a discussion with friends, parents, and brothers. In addition, they can get some suggestions from their teachers or they can also conduct investigations using books or the internet to add more information. I think that these consequent practices are very important for students to develop their way of thinking. In contrast, learning facts does not need such pressures. It is easy to access the facts without any kind of thinking. To learn facts, students just sit down on their seats in the class room and just listen to what their teacher says. In this case, the information is only given from their teacher to students.","If students listen to what their teacher says and write it down in their notebook, they can get new knowledge.",1

As a result of these complex interactions of the above factors,most of the time adequate knowledge of any of the subjects is not acquired. As a result of this a person becomes a jack of all Trades but master of none. Secondly,lots of subjects mean a lot of hardwork,and there will be too little time for personal life,which means he will have less time for making new friends,watching movies and partying.

1020869.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people young blood young acts more adventures more fun. Thats what lies with the young people of our society rather than the older people. young people are always generous to go for some wild adventures and live life every second Older people are always burdened with various responsibilities to support their family and society,they also want to impart their experiences to the next generation. In contrast the younger ones want to go on a date with  their mate this evening,he wants to purchase the latest gadgets melting the ice in the city with its features and hottie looks,What about the latest cars,and wardrobe thats IN. A young person can always go for the nightouts with his friends,and rock at the nearest disc,but an older person can go for dinner with his family or with hi business clients and have a meal along with some wine and get back home.",Younger ones can go for a long tour and enjoy it along with their friends whereas the older ones cant go anywhere without the consent of  their mate or may be with them.,1
149753.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There is an argument concerning whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. some people might say that learning one special subject is a more effective way of studying. however I agree with this statement. because people can build their career and social skills. I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea in this essay. First, people are able to develop their career through having various subjects. in other words, If someone studies only in his area. he/she only knows about his field. so his/her skills can be narrow and limited. In my experience, when I was a university student. my major was the Study of Vietnam. so I could speak and write vietnamese well. but when I graduated from school.",It is not necessary.,1
1747254.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"As far as I am concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. A student, in general, even if he has the idea of what to do in his working future, does not always match his dreams with the real life. It can happen that the economic situation at the beginning of his studies could be very different from the one at the end of his studies. This can happen for several reasons, such as political, economic, and so on. If a student starts to concentrate only on a specific subject, that can be for example, literature , at the end of his studies I will be very well educated on that subject, but in a world that is requiring people that have technological skills. It is important to say that a student that is involved in many academic subjects will be able to manage all of it, but he will always have the possibility to specialize in one of them. I want to say that the best choice to make is to study many academic subjects because it is always possible to specialize in one specific subject during the study period. On the other hand it is always more difficult to change its own study plan from a specific subject to many academic subjects. Only if a student has the chance to study different academic subjects can he also have the opportunity to discover his talent in subjects that he did not know that he was able to do. Sometimes talent is hidden and only a good teacher can help students to reveal it. Students, if they decide to study only a specific academic subject, will not give the chance to any professor to discover their talent. The Italian University educational approach is based on many academic subjects that can give students the opportunity to learn different topics and also not linked from each one. Only after university , can they choose to specialize in one specific subject.","I can see that Italian students, in the end, are more prepared than USA students, these latter are too specialized in only one subject and unable to face real life so different and changeable.",1
1473209.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons. First, young people are less interested in the activities of their communities, although communities are indispensable for people to live in. For example, I participate in a clean up activity around the central station of my city. This activity is held every week and young people who live in my city are strongly encouraged to attend, however, there are few young people among the participants. This example clearly shows that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Second, the vote rate of young people in elections in Japan is generally much less than that of elderly people, although joining the political process of communities is an important activity to keep their communities active and healthy. To join the political process, the voter must have their opinion about their communities. If young people participate in their communities, they should have some opinion about the situation or future of their communities, and they should have a strong incentive to go voting. This is the reason why I think young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Third, there are many companies which help elderly people with their house hold errands and chores.",The companies run their customers' errands instead of instead of elderly people.,1
1222636.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with this statement. The reason is that in the twenty years there were not many cars in use as now or because people could not afford to buy one. If we look at history, the twenty years were not many successful for many people. For example, in the United States although there was a period of health in the early twenties and people could afford to buy cars, in the last years of the century the Depression let many people withoutjobs, houses and without even necessary items. As well in Europe, as always, there were so many status differences between people that only rich people had the opportunity to get cars. However, today there are a lot of different models of cars and you can buy a car cheaper than in those years. For example, now a little car that allows you to drive along the city costs about 6,000 euros that is a reasonableprice. Also, nowadays, you have the chance of buying a car and paying for it every month for several years, so even young people having good jobs can afford to drive their own cars. Besides, you have the option of buying a car that has been used before. We know that, propably the car will be broken before a new one but, if you really need it and you do not have enough money to buy a new one, it is an option that can be considered. However if you have money to spend and you really like cars, there is a huge variety of them to buy. Nowadays, cars can almost drive by themselves or at least, park. This type of car is from Japan or China and maybe, in not a long time, many people will be able to get these wonderful cars. As we can see, today, there are so many options on the market that make it possible for everyone to get a car in an economical way, if they want, or to buy a super car spending more money.","However, I think that in twenty years getting a car was a thing for only rich people and it is for sure that there were not so many options as we have today to choose one, based not only on the price but also in our preferences.",1

1093568.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Since oil is running out, cars, in the future, will be less valued and sought than in the past and present, and there is an increasing demand for private helicopters or airplanes by which people can save time waiting for traffic congestion. Furthermore, public transportation would be incredibly convenient and easily accessible to the extent that people only prefer to use the whole of it. First of all, in less than twenty years, the oil would run out and the oil-required cars would be completely replaced by electric cars. However, electric cars have tons of problems related to their speed, efficiency of the electricity, and so on. Considering this fact, I think that many people would prefer to find other ways of accessing the place they want. Second, more public focuses and interests are being given to private helicopters or airplanes. Somewhat wealthy people might already possess one or even two. There are several reasons why people prefer to own private helicopters or mini airplanes. In recent societies, the most prevalent is vehicles on the road and the most rampant one is also vehicles on the road, which causes lots of traffic congestion and sometimes even high ways are jammed.",There is no single family that does not own their own private vehicles.,1

1570255.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly agree with the statement "" it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. ""Students are required to understand ideas and concepts. The main reason for this is the ideas are going to increase the way they think and the concepts help them to implement their thoughts. The lecturers should teach students to get ideas for new things from their childhood. They should give some questions and tell them to implement their lessons. Such that their brain gets more ideas when they see or come to know about a particular point. Suppose for example let us take a topic in mathematics , there are many ways to solve one particularproblem. Here comes a picture of ideas the, student thinks of in many different ways to solve a particular problem any how, these can be implemented only by concepts but not facts. And puzzles can be solved by implementing different ideas. Suppose a puzzle has many ways then only an idea can help him to find the right way. Facts are those which have already taken place. Facts can be learned on their own. One can gather facts from newspapers, magazines and many other places. Facts are implemented earlier, before facts ideas and concepts are developed, with these development of ideas and repeatedly occurring of the same thing they were recorded as facts. Some facts may help the student but with out concepts these facts may not be understood clearly.",Facts are those they are already implemented.,1
1736945.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the statement that""Young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities"". Because young people nowadays have become very responsible and honest towards their customers. The young people of today are working more and they earn high salaries,but they are always first in helping the communities the best example is helping the people ,who are victims of the tsunami. The students community and graduates collected the money and the clothesand distributed it to affected people. All over the world, people say that the future of any country or place liesin the hands of the young,it seems to me that it is correct. In particular, in developing countries, educated young people are playing major in the elections,and they are always ready to help the uneducated people.","The young people are working very hard to get in to this highly competitive world, they are having less time to help society.",1
1698475.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do? To answer this question is important to take two points of view, the first one is to answer why young people enjoy life, and then answer why old people enjoy life, and finally i will see who enjoy life more, young people or older people. I think that younger people enjoy life, because they are in an age where everything is known, they are exploring the world, they are dreaming, they are building their goal, which is a wonderful moment in life. It is when people start to grow up , and during this process they understand and respond to many questions that only living can answer, It is a stage when you can make a mistake, and it is ok because you are learning, no one is going to judge you, It is part of learning. I think that i am in a great moment of my life, I feel and I am young, and if i take my own experience i can say that i really enjoy my life, i had difficulties in my life but they were just part of it, sometimes you need to feel and then stand up and go on, thats life. By the other hand, i think that older people also enjoy life, because no matter the age that you have you will always learn , and at this point in your life you have more experience, so you dont have to worry about if you are going to make a mistake, because you know that if you make it everything will be ok. For example my grand ma was an old lady, but she was a kid, she never felt old, she always learning , and at this point in her life she had more experience ,t do when se was a child so she didn't have to worry about it.","Know she is death, but she teaches that life is only one and you have to enjoy it, no matter your age.",1
1979614.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I fully agree with the claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This method of teaching has been widely known and is used by students all over the world. And I agree with this method because I believe students require full understanding of concepts therefore they could have longer knowledge, and create their own thoughts through understanding the concepts. First of all, the most effective way to learn things would be understanding concepts and ideas. Since students get to understand its concepts or the ideas, it makes them fully understand it and also, it remains in students' minds and it becomes part of their knowledge for longer than when they learn its facts. For instance, from my personal experience, I only remember a few mathematical formulas or the scientific terms that I memorised when I was in middle school. Moreover, I could only memorise a few things even from last year which facts I have learned. On the other hand, I can crystalize things that I have experienced. For instance, I have clear memories that I have learned from experiments in biology class which I experienced in my younger age. In fact, understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students and is a more effective way to learn than it is for them to learn facts. Secondly, Understanding the concepts makes students able to think further. Interestingly, most of the great inventions such as the phone and computers came from basic understanding of the concepts.","Thus, sometimes facts work well for students to learn complex things.",1
1813856.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I strongly believe that successful people tend to face and challenge new things and tasks rather than doing one thing they can do well. First of all, those who are changing constantly can succeed now. Some people think that doing one thing continuously is more efficient than doing many things. However, It is now not available. Nowadays, everything is so fast and complex. So people can easily feel bored at the same thing. For example, as many people know, the rock group 'Radiohead' is still popular. They have been singing for more than ten years. there were many popular rock groups at that time. Radiohead changed their music style and challenged new things that people had never heard. If they had had stock in their one style of music, they could not have continued their popularization. Furthermore, challenging new things and facing new tasks are more exciting and refreshing. Only doing onething makes people feel bored and lazy. people who are lazy can not be better than those who are excited about doing something. suppose you have to eat hamburger everyday. Even if the hamburgers are delicious, you would be sick of having the same food. Moreover, While people challenge new things people can learn new skills.",we do not need to try something which we already know how to do well.,1
675940.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities or not. some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their communities. However, I firmly believe that helping their communities is quite an important thing in their life. First of all, We can not live by ourselves. we have to help each other. of course that is an option and we can choose whatever we want, but nowadays, It would be harder and harder if people tried to live bythemselves. If we try to spend our time in communities, It can be a good way to get to know many people who can help us when we get into a hard time. For example, I was trying to have my own piano recitle in my communites. and I heard that is not so easy. but fortunately I was a volunteer in my community last summer and through that experience, I had a chance to get to know lots of people who could help me. so I could have a report very easily because of their recommendations. Secondly, we can improve our social skills. nowadays, people tend to be isolated. but I dont think that is the best way to live. For example, I have a friend and she always tries to be alone in her room. I thought she enjoyed her time by herself but one day, she got a disease and It was depression.","If she tried to live out of her room, she would get sick.",1

569140.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"No one wants to be poor; everyone wants to improve their own status, or quality of life. That's why people try to work hard on studying or exploring. Then successful people tend to try new thing s and take risks because of three befits; new opportunities , high outcomes, and freeness. First of all, trying new things has new opportunities. Because no one has done it before, if people pursue new things, they can be the first people in a particular field. I-pod examinations this outcome. Because the creator of the I-pod made the first creative MP3, the I-pod became the symbol of MP3, making many profits. There are so many MP3 in the music world, but the I-pod is the first, making a strong impression onfolks. Secondly, successful people tend to take risks and get the possibility of a high outcome. If people avoid taking risks and bet just a small amount of money. they are never going to be the same status throughout their lives. Successful people, for example, spend a large amount of money to build a new office instead of limiting risks, they created a great office, making employees comfortable and willing to do their tasks. Finally, trying and taking risks have freedom leading to success. As I said, no one has done it before, people exploring new things do not have to follow existing rules or retrospects. Sometimes, bad habits kill new imaginative ideas. In order to succeed, creative thinking is crucial to making profits. All in all, successful people are more likely to start new things and take risks for new opportunities, huge benefits, and freedom.",People tend to be afraid to try new things and take risks and avoid these things.,1
1388232.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. However, others disagree. In my opinion, I think the former statement is true. This is because young people are energetic, brave, and courageous. Young people always have energy to do many things. For example, they will use their free time to hang out with their friends. They will go to some places to enjoy themselves as clubs, bars, and movie centers. Furthermore, young people are more attracted by the colourful world rather than staying at home. They are afraid of grounding because it is indispensable for them to have fun. In addition to being energetic, people who are young have the bold to enjoy their life. For instance, they try to do things which older people are afraid to do. Like ferry wheels. One can conceive a 80-year-old man sitting on the ferry wheels will almost kill him, but not a young person. They are always curious about new things. Moreover, they will not bother how much money they have left. Instead, they will have a great time spending the money to find their dream beautiful life.

The second group say that it is a bad idea because we have to consider the time factor.

155456.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Although many people think that there is nothing to worry about while there is a guide. He would be responsible for all the needs they want. I personally disagree with the assertion that going with a tour guide is the best way to travel. First of all, traveling with a group could waste a lot of time waiting for another person. And it is very inconvenient to go travelling with a lot of people, especially as they are all strangers to me. There will be several rules that you should follow. It is not romance and happy at all. Second, the tour guide often wants to have an abundant impression of all the people in the group. The places are arranged too much; in the end, there is always not enough time to spend in each place the group has been to. I could not remember or experience the environments where I only spent five minutes staying with them. I need more time and enjoy the difference between where I live and where I used to live. Last but not least, I have heard more than one time that people have the same impression of the same country they have been to. It is because the guide always takes people to the same place. For example, It is the same as the pictures of my friends and my parents which they took in France, only the faces are different. However, I want something more than all the people's experiences. To see the real things happening in foreign countries is more interesting than the photos on the post cards. In conclusion, it is not interesting at all if I can not decide where I want to go.

There are some evidences that show why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. On a trip field, it is kind of boom for many young people in Korea to go to Europe for their travel recently. Not only Europe, but also many countries, such as the States, the U. K. , southern Asia, Latin America. The most important thing is that they go travelling with their money which is from their part-time job or their work. Whereas, there is no doubt that older people didn't usually go travelling abroad when they were younger. It's because they couldn't afford travelling abroad at that time, which doesn't mean that they didn't want to. Besides, development for flying abroad was not enough for them at that time. In other words, there were a few barriers for older people to travel abroad.

I agree that learning ideas and concepts is much more important than learning facts in terms of forming more creative and responsive individuals. As I mentioned above learning ideas and concepts should become prior for students because the major aim of the learning is educating himself and increasing the information to make some sort of comparisons or to come up with results or new ideas.,"Therefore, learning facts is impossible for students and anyone, they have to create and form their own facts by combining the ideas and concepts that they learn.",1

443398.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am inclined to agree with the statement that people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful. I have certain reasons to agress with this statement which I will discuss later in my essays. I would also like to highlight the fact that taking such risks might not get the success in the 1st attempt, sometimes people need to attempt multiple times. The main reason for this my view is that I believe in the ""More risk, More gain"" philosophy. If I decide to get into some new business/idea, which nobody has tried, I need comparatively more resources in terms of money, time and effort to pursue this new venture. There is a chance that this new venture could fail, but on the positive note if that business/idea succeeds , I would have a tremendous potential to make money in this new business as I will not have much competition. I will give an example of John Chambers, CEO of a networking company. This company was traditionally in the business of selling networking devices. As its business became more mature and competition increased , John decided to take some risks and expanded into the telephony business and became successful in this new business. This company ranks as number one in telephone business. The 2nd reason for my view is that unless I venture into unknown territories I will not know what lies there. As a human, we always have this comfort zone which we do not want to leave but there is no guarantee that there is no risk in what we are doing today. My brother has a gift business and he was very comfortable in that business. I insisted him to try exporting business, though he was initially reluctant but he tried and became successful.","In conclusion, I believe that risk taking is a shirt cut to success which we should try.",1
18618.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I disagree with the statement that having broad knowledge in academic subjects is better than being a specialist in one subject. There are several reasons to confirm my opinion i will list them. The first argument for this is that, having a special education you will receive a great job and earn a lot ofmoney. I will show an example of an architect. For this job you need special education in only one way of an academic subject. Arcitects for example are looked after on the job market and because of this they would earn a lot of money and have fun in their job. But when you have a great knowledge of many academic resources you might have problems with finding a job, having a career and earning a lot ofmoney. The  reason for this is that in most companies you are required to have a special education.",So there will not be any job challenges for this kind of broad educated people.,1

1293221.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I feel that young people enjoy their life more than the older ones because young people don't have any responsibilities. For example compare a girl to her mother. Basically a girl only has a responsibility to study and if she has finished doing it, she probably enjoys it by freeking out with friends to a good place orby going to some friends'house. But her mother who has a lot of responsibility like her daughter,and the other child she has so basically she is busy withher responsibilities. she doesn't at least not find time to enjoy herself. And if she is a working woman she has to move to her job in the morning and when she returns home she needs to do some work like cooking and cleaning the home. So finally she is tired at the end of the day and she doesn't at least have time to enjoy herself and she feels it is time to take a rest. But basically enjoying yourself also depends on the people's character some people are there who really enjoy their work they feel that they enjoy doing their work properly. And some people enjoy it all the time by making fun.",I feel age is not a matter to enjoy or responsibilities are not a part which stop people enjoying  themselves.,1

Some people say this society has lots of young people who help our communities and show some examples of articles in newspapers written about young people who help the community, but I think they are particular young people. Most young people do not spend their time helping their communities. It is real nowadays. Lots of young people are personalized people nowadays. They do not think about others' situations. The only thing they focused on was their own problem. Moreover, young people nowadays do not like activity or performance, rather like staying at home. At home, they play computer games or video games. They even communicate with their friends on line and not off-line. For example, they chat and do group homework via a messenger program on a computer. It is natural that these two boys do not like helping their communities. Helping communities needs lots of activity. Studying harder than in the past is one reason, too.",Young people in the past were not depressed by studying.,1

But nowadays, study is a prior thing to young people. Oil prices are rising and a long-term depression in the economy exists so young people are concerned about their future naturally. So, they cannot afford to give enough time to helping their communities. It is another reason that old people do not struggle to make young people help their communities. In the past, old people were good role models to young people. But society is developing and lots of people live in cities, old people also no longer give enough time to helping their communities.","Roughly speaking, the problem that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is making old people who have not helped their communities.",1

434370.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I personally agree with the statement that it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learning the facts because for a student getting to understand many facts is very important before applying them. For example, let us take a student who on the school stage appears for an exam. If he prepares a particular lesson in the syllabus by mere mugging or learning the facts in the textbook without getting to understand the concept and the idea of what the lesson expresses ,it would be very difficult for him to pen down on his examination because one can basically only rely on memory. What if the student gets tense as soon as he sees the question about that particular portion. Being more anxious could result in palpitations and he may not put forth the answer. Instead if the student had just understood the idea and concept then it would have been easy for him to put forth and develop in his own words too which may actually be an expressive thought and eventually fetch him more marks. Take an other example of a research student. A research paper to be completed needs lots of information which should be compiled properly to meet the requirements of the research study. For this to happen, students try to gather a lot of information and materials,take notes,read. establish in mind how to put in orders needs lots of ideas. Only if he can understand the basic concept of that particular subject or paper can he develop new ideas which will fetch him good notes to complete a research paper eventually winning praise for his work which shows confidence. This will be very useful for the student if he is asked to deliver a paper presentation,because he has already understood the concept and the basic idea which has given him the confidence to express and deliver in a public gathering. Another example could also be taken which was proved, which isNewton's Law of Gravity. Just because Newton had the capacity to understand his topic to be invented his thought process welcomed the idea and thus the Law of Gravity was exposed to the world.",If he had just learned the fact probably till now the law of fraud wouldnt have been in existence.,1
1172944.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Responsibility plays a big role in our life, especially for older people. when a young child is having fun and he doesn't care about money, home and issues that happen to any person. Young people think that they still have good health but when they get older their health will start to go down. I agree with young people who want to have more fun than older people for a couple of reasons. First of all, responsibility as I mentioned in the beginning, makes any person think about how to make his life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do. For example in any family, the father always thinks about how to get money for his children, the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially. If we look at the children, we can notice that they want to play everyday and have fun without thinking about anything. That was a good example of showing the difference in how young and old people act. The second reason is that old people always start to take care of their health which absolutely goes down as they get older. On the other hand, young people think about no responsibility and no problems with their health, so why don't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future.","For example, if someone is 60 years old and he is retired from his job, he could have health problems and refuse him to enjoy his life.",1
738187.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In general,it is better to have both the tasks i. e. ,Broad knowledge of many academic subjects and also specialization in particular subjects. Depending on the present concern,i prefer specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Having specialization in one specific subject shows one's own interest in picking a particular subject of greater importance in the present trend of education.",I prefer this because having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is of no use as all the academic subjects may not carry equal importance.,1
1042872.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Nowadays, the most used way to get around is by car. From the eighteenth century when the first car was produced, many changes have occurred in the car market and in the ways to use this kind of transport. Since the past, people have needed to move from one place to another place. For this reason some kinds of transport have beeninvented, for example train, bus, airplane and car. The growth of cities made the need for people to find a way to get around the city in an easy way, so they can get to work or to school, for that, personal transport is needed and the car is a personal one. Thus even more people bought cars to move. Nevertheless cars produce a lot of pollution that contributes to damage to the atmosphere in which we live. But at the present day, there is much more awareness about this problem, so many people are finding some ways to reduce the use of cars, for example using carpooling, or using public transport.","In conclusion, at the present day there are a lot of cars that produce a lot of pollution, but I think that man is more conscious of this problem now than he was in the past, so i think that there will be fewer cars in twenty.",1
1019050.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"These days, many technology systems are developed. For example, we could play in many ways these days like playing an X-box in their houses and going to the movie theatre. On the other hand, old people might not have a chance to play or watch the movie at the theatre with their friends. Not only playing to enjoy life, we could also find our new jobs easily and find their habits easily through the internet explorer. First of all, many young people these days play X-box in their house. Probably in the old days, they just played outside of sports like basketball or soccer. However, these days, we can play soccer or basketball in our house using an X-box. The new technology systems affect us in many ways. For example, we are allowed to talk to someone anywhere and at any time we want. By calling or e-mailing each other, we could find an enjoyable life. In addition, many young people these days also go to the movie theatre to watch the movies. In the movie theatre, we could choose the movie we want to watch. For instance, scary movies and sad movies. By watching them we could have a fun time in our spare time. Also while we watch the movie we can also eat any foods we want.","In the old days, they didn't have any movies, so probably they all watched the news all the time.",1

1767558.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Traditionally, many people, including those who are going to advertise their own products, believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they are and this enhanced image from the advertisements helps to increase the sales of the products. However, my opinion is that this common sense does not always make sense. The chief reason for my view is that ill-manufactured advertisements could have bad effects on the product image or sales performances. If information about a certain product which a customer wants to know from the advertisement is not provided in the advertisement, most customers may forget the product after looking at the advertisements. Moreover, many advertisements could not succeed in focusing on the characteristics which the customer wants to catch in the advertisements. The other reason for my view is that core value or quality of product could not be invented even though most famous artists or advertisement agents manufacture the advertisement. Real value or real qualities could be diffused by other types of advertisements such as blogs on the internet, word of mouth, or articles in the newspapers or magazines. Some might argue that even though an advertisement could be ill-manufactured or create different effects expected, most advertising could create productive effects. But there are many examples that show how severe the effects the ill-manufactured advertisements had had. For example, a car manufacturer's advertisement puts a stress on more security-guaranteed facilities in a small car. But most prospective small car customers want to know how much the price of the new small car will be because most prospective customers will use that car as a second car and already strengthen big cars.","In sum, I concur with the opinion that advertising could have good effects on the product's image or sales growth.",1

For example, if you talk with a young boy exhausted by the others or with an older man that travels a lot you revaluate the argument. Anyway the sentence is true in the major parts of situations. For young people it is easier to enjoy life. There are many attractions, places, events for them than for older people. Young people can go to a disco to dance, they have no problems with money, they can go on holiday and find new friends more easily. They don't have any real problems or very difficult situations.

236229.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion successful people are more related to trying new things but they are not necessarily more attracted totaking risks. The reason for my thinking is that people who are successful normally lead a company or are the owner of some kind of business. Therefore they have responsibility for many employees who are working in the firm. For example when the boss of a company wants to develop a new, lets say, a new car. The car works with new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested well yet and will probably not make much money. In my opinion the business leader should not take the risk of developing the car until it has been well known in a country and has reached high interest. Because if it does not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employees would be unemployed. Nevertheless I think that successful people are more willing to try new things. They probably develop new things and also give impulses for the future. That means that they are pre- thinkers of future ideas. In spite of my opinion I could imagine that there are successful people who take risks.",These people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care about the people who depend on their decisions.,1

On the other hand old people, actually not very older, have a good experience of enjoying their life with a lot of things. I believe this because they have a lot of possibilities, such as more free time than young people and more money. I think that in this society money is very important for everything because it helps you to enjoy your life. For example you can go on holiday where youwant. Instead young people can't because they need an allowance from parents and they must go to school. So they can't go on holiday where they want.

Young people,for instance, a child would be the happiest person ever,if her mother buys her the candy she wants yet an old person would be the happiest person ever if she sees her children,coming to visit her,calling her or going somewhere peaceful maybe.

396748.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people have different opinions on whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my opinion, most students do not spend time helping their society. First, the students do not like to help their communities. Second, most of them do not have enough time. I will explain in detail. To begin with, young people spend time computer gaming. As long as the Internet is developed, they are interested in the game of computers. Let me take my experience as an example. My school all together go to the federal organization for poor people. However, I have not helped poor people alone. Next, young people will not have enough time to help the poor people of their society.

A group of people coming together on a shared idea or opinion is called a community. Before the advent of the internet, people had to be physically present to be in the community, now it is not so. I think that with the exponential increase in which young users are releasing the benefits of the internet, there is a lot of time to create, expand and cherish the communities. Information age has given us more communities than there were any previously. If you just browse yahoo. com and orkut. com, you will find a community already present in which you are interested. Be it music, software, movies, entertainment, fund raising and so on. Young people not only create these communities but also make sure that they take active part in them by updating the latest and removing the rest. with the increasing number of users help is ensured to be given to the needed. Also, In today's world where people are living in high-rise buildings, I am sure every member of each house in the apartment will come together to form a committee, to atleast make sure that they know each other. when they come together they also find ways in which to solve each others' problems. Youngsters who care about society will make sure that community festivals are held with their utmost diligence. for example the Ganesh chaturiti festival in India, there are more young people than old ones and the festival is celebrated with full vigor and enthusiasm. In a typical college environment, there are many communities formed by young people who make sure that many weaker students get the necessary additional help that is needed.","Communities can only exist if there is a shared interest, but now a days there are so many choices and as young minds change every now and then we think that they are not helping the community in which they have taken part.",1

When they are students, every day is full of something to do mandatarily such as homework, tutorials, lessons. Also young parents are so hectic almost everyday earning money, working house chores, taking care of children and being social to survive the difficulties which come into their lives. Just during the holidays they can relax and enjoy some time, then they have to struggle again after those certain times. It is hard even to think of themselves and their lives for a short time.

In my opinion,i prefer travelling alone than travelling with a group of people. The reasons are talked about below. firstly,the goal of my travelling is to relax. I would not like to plan it typically and would like to go somewhere i really like. If i can choose i will stay in one place for enough time. After hard work,people want to relax and do not like to obey the schedules. For example,when you asked one whether he or she would like to plan their leisure time. Many of them will say no and give the answer to stop the telephone going somewhere one likes,no guide ,no many people ,quiet,really relaxed. People do not like to bring a schedule into their leisure time. Because the hard days Secondly, travelling alone is a popular method in the world and people can explore new places than the old ones. We really like going to new places rather than old places. But travelling with a group does not meet the need. People like adventures. For example,in china there are many famous places just like the Great wall and the Summer Palace. If somebody chooses the group to travel to the famous places,he or she will be disappointed because there are so many people in the Great wall that one can not have a good look at it. On the other hand ,when one walks alone and chooses the best days,he or she will please themselves with the great picture of nature. Thirdly,the tour guide is somewhat troublesome. He or she always leads the group of people to the shopping mall buying many things that the tour people do not really want. The exact time of the visit is short and one can not have pleasure with the visit. It is a question that someone travelling with a group can meet. And many people do not like that.","Last but not the least,there are many benefits to travelling with a group by a tour guide.",1

1684107.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement of course. Nowadays young people are not involved in helping their own community. For me the problem is young people's education and our modern way of life. In fact in modern society the most important thing is success , and the first thing that is related to this is certainly the idea of competition. Since we were children everyone (parents, relatives, friends, teachers) has taught us that the only thing that is important is to be the best. A good example is a football match where for everyone the only goal is victory, and participation and meeting with other people is not important. So we tend to see our social life in this way too.","We don't have to help the community where we live, we only have to fight against the others and try to be the best one.",1

I prefer the idea that people should try to do their best within their ability and resources. And, even if they fail, I think they have had their own success. This success means that breaking our own limitations could be happiness for people. For example, there was a man, who quit a big company and started a small coffee shop.","Even though he was so enthusiastic about making the shop profitable, he eventually went bankrupt.",1

For instance, after Henry Ford introduced a commercialized car for ordinary people, many car makers tried to follow suit and jump into the car industry. Nevertheless, they were just followers. They did just what Ford did. While some car makers are still making great profits, in my opinion, they are not truly successful. They imitate what the great man did.","Of course, followers can have great success.",1
160123.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Yes, I do agree with the statement stated below. Having broad knowledge of many subjects is better than having knowledge in one subject. Because, every subject in the academic year is related to the other subjects. As we know, MATHEMATICS is the father of all subjects. It has a major influence on all other subjects. There is no such subject which does not have an influence on it. having a knowledge of it only one can have the knowledge of the other subjects completely. For example, in our Bachelor's degree, we have the subjects MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS and WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS. Each have the influence on the other.","Mobile communication is the study of the science of wireless transmissions, whereas wireless transmission is the path for the mobile transmission.",1

I disagree with travelling in a group led by a tour guide because maybe he has different interests and there is no time for rest. first, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is not always good because i have my opinion about which place i prefer to visit for a long time in one place. for example, five years ago i went on a group tour from Germany to France but i did not find any time to visit my favourite place because i have to follow the leader in addition we are very different in age. so i will not travel with a group leader. Second, there is a special time for us to visit many places and i have to follow the guide and listen to him so you can not rest if you like this or that place because he has a plane for the trip.","while travelling in a group led by a tour guide, it is good to see many things in a short time and with a person who has knowledge but it is nice to do what you want with out any bother.",1

One such experience occurred in my tenth class where i usually learn facts about my subjects such as physics,social studies,mathematics before exams.

1293498.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities, because they have time to help their communities. But I do not think so. I have some reasons for this. Firstly, young people are too busy and selfish. Their time is occupied by their schedule. For example, in Japan, my country, the number of people going to schools has been increasing at a high speed, because the quantity of things for teaching public schools in Japan has been cut. In their school, they cannot learn enough knowledge. Moreover, many young people are always playing with their friends or are always staying at home despite not having anything to do. For those reasons, I think, they do not want/can not help. Secondly, recently, the opportunity for having relationships in their communities is decreasing. In particular, in urban areas, the connection between people is very weak. For instance, my friend has never participated in events of her communities, such as a Japanese festival, instead of only seeing them. My home town is suburban. So I often take part in Japanese festivals. Of course, all members of my family do, also, at the least half of the population of my town do, too.",So I disagree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,1
821639.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Nowadays, the advertisements play such an important role in the marketing of the product even if the product is bad for the consumer or if it has bad quality. The advertisements make the products look good, thats why the advertisements are created, and to induce the customer to buy the product. The advertisements are a way to persuade people to buy things that other people do. Everything is about fashion nowadays and thats why people are accustomed to buying things that are commonly used by all people, like a new pair of shoes or a new cellphone model. The advertisements appear everywhere people go because the industries want to make their product well known in the area where they are doing the campaign. An example of products that use alot of marketing are all the soda industries. Like Coca Cola or Pepsi both of these businesses use lots of advertisements that say that their product is better than the other. Another example of this is the tobacco industry, because the advertisements that they do of cigarettes tell people that they should smoke and they dont tell that the product is harmful to health. The advertisements are every where like on the radio, on  the Internet and in cars that are carrying product stickers or models with the product. But all the time the advertisements make the product look really good even though the product is bad or harmful to your health. The industries only care about selling they dont care about the quality of the product, an example of this is the products that say that they can stop hair loss These products have such advertisements that some people fall in their tails to buy them even if the hair loss continues there is only a waste of money and time.",But the advertisements improve the appearance of the appearance of the product.,1

There are a variety of them and they help us a lot; for example, transportation- both humans and cargoes. Besides, they save time. We benefit from cars very much. Undeniably, convenient as cars contribute, we can not ignore the negative impact they have ; say, the exhaust and energy consumption. However, scientists are now trying to figure out some alternative solutions such as biodiesel. Using biological sources, cars will not cause environmental problems. Since new technology has been developing at a breathtaking speed, I am optimistic about the future.

1800750.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The media of today is a very powerful tool. In other words the media is the king of the world. Whatever is shown in the television, in the newspapers and in the magazines is greatly influencing the public. Children and even some adults get carried away by their tactics. The influence may be negative or positive. I believe that they sometimes mislead people. Thus i completely agree that the advertisements make the products seem much better than they are. Adversitements that are in forms of writing on paper or those seen visually on the television are very different from those that they actually show or tell us. Firstly the products shown in these advertisements are not what they actually show us. Lets take the example of medicines. The advertisements in a mere ten to fifteen seconds try to explain to us what it should be taken and what it should be avoided. They may inform us that they do wonders for , like lets take an example of a patient with some heart disease. They may tell us that they can help cure or treat high cholesterol in just one month and also tell us that you don't need to follow a diet. But scientifically how can a high cholesterol be cured in a month and that without having a diet?Thus i believe that these can be misleading Sometimes they may tell us that any kind of skin problem be it on the face or any other part of the body can be taken care of. They may use the words like "" magical cream "". The patients may believe them. They may use them but in vane. Actually this is just a tactic they follow to fool us. Lets take another example of a "" hair remover cream "". The advertisements may show a beautiful girl with no hair on her face or legs. She would say. "" for a silky skin like mine use so and so cream "". The irony is that they already have a girl who had no hair on her face or legs.",So they are not trying to mislead people.,1

Maybe older people think that we live a happy life we have no life for fact. and the reason that we don't have life is because of adults. We are told to do what our parents tell us to do. they tell us if you study hard you will have a better life later.

I feel that young people are persistent and are more confident. Young people look on the world as a sphere containing numerous opportunities. They have the tendency to prepare for the future and achieve their goals through hard work. Young people are more energetic unlike older people. This helps young people to fulfill their goals. For instance, a boy at seventeen can aspire to become a pilot and even accomplish it through his hardwork and energy. This may be difficult for older people because the response to any kind of situation like moving the accelerator hard reduces with the passage of time. Moreover,young people are more persistent.

When one is young, he has lots of responsibilities,such as exams or decisions for the rest of his life. These are really great aspects of his life. What about olders? They do not have many responsibilities except their health. In my opinion,young people enjoy life more than older people do. Actually, they have more chance to enjoy themselves in terms of their health and enjoyment opportunities. Although having big responsibilities, young people can have more energy for fun. Due to the fact that their physical conditions are more suitable, they could be able to do almost anything they prefer. For example, if you want to do bungee jumping you have to have a strong heart and generally youngsters have. Another point is that funny things are generally produced for young people. Because generally the number of young people more than older business owners focuses on the young people'spreferences.

Instead of being replaced by other transportation systems, they have changed to better versions continuously. Moreover, some people are very interested in buying or collecting old versions of popular cars, like the classic model of the  Beatles "". Cars may be considered just as a means of moving. But the purpose of owning a car has changed over time, and nowadays some want cars to show their life style and personalities. For this reason, there will be more cars in the future. However, it's possible that new and better means of transporting will be invented in the future, but I believe that cars will be developed to be a better means than now. As we've been doing this for a long time, we can find better resources for power, and also better designs for cars. Also there will be more cars considering people 's tastes today.

First of all i guess that it would be very difficult to learn about many subjects and that those who want to follow this way have to spend so much effort on it. I totally disagree with the statement and the reason, which i mentioned previously, is because i prefer to be more realistic, in fact i think that if you specialize in a specific subject you can improve your skill at it and you can get a job or be hired from someone more likely than if you have few notions about many things. Another important point is that if you are specializing in a particular thing you are supposed to be very interested in it and you can really enjoy studying it and go more in depth. with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can probably just have a shallow knowledge of them instead of studying them deeply.","Finally i think that it is pretty wrong to have a wide knowledge spread among a lot of subjects even though i think that without specialists , the world , wouldn't be as it is known, i guess that it would still be as it was in the past, without all the new inventions that changed history and our way of life.",1

This is because only knowing the ideas doesn't help them to understand the theories accurately. The facts help them to get the live ideas of the theories they study. For example if we consider the lightening and the sound which will occur during the time of rain gives them the idea that the sound is heard before the light appears.

917176.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"An education system based on unchangable knowledge, leads students to learn these ideas; and this undesirable situation will continue for a long time and it seems to pass over into the next centuries. In spite of the fact that it is the most important and preferable choice to learn the facts instead of learning the same ideas and concepts all the time, it is necessary for students to be successful in their class, and also many teachers don`t open new facts in the world. First of all, for many students, it is quite important to succeed in their lesson; so it motivates them in a way that they should learn ideas and concepts instead of facts. The education system in our country is also the same. Many of my friends try to learn something that is given in a classroom and do not give any importance to searching for facts about that subject. It is enough for them to know the idea, and other aspects of that area are not necessary. This reality is not something appreciated, but systems make people behave in such a way. Another aspect of this choice is based on some teachers who are quite old and still try to teach and give lessons to students. They don` t want to learn new innovents in the world, and try to create students in a way they know and think. If students don't lead the same way, their teachers always criticize them and don't threaten them in a nice way; therefore many students feel upset and it will affect their study life badly.","In conclusion, it is more important to understand ideas instead of facts to be more successful in this education system, and also to get teachers to admire you.",1

Some assumed that it is the most important for students to understand ideas and concepts in contradiction to this some think that the best for the students to learn facts. I totally agree with the first idea. These are the following reasons. The first reason for my belief is that,the students must learn the ideas first. Because the ideas are important and also the concepts. Students must pay attention to the ideas and concepts rather than the facts. If students learn the ideas and the concepts the student can learn the facts by time. The second reason for my belief is that,the facts are not important exactly. Because the ideas make the shape to the facts. So its concept is important so it is related to the ideas. If the student learns the ideas first he or she can prepare the facts before and he or she can look at the facts in different ways.

The reason why I am in agreement with this is that I suppose that successful people are dedicated to making better in any way they operate, and they want everytime a new target, much more difficult from the past, to obtain. For this reason they try new things and sometimes they take risks but this gives them the sensation of the power and the potential they have. The normal people see them and consider that in the same situation or position they didn't take risks fairly like successful people do. Infact normal people many times, consider successful people too much out of the world for the reason that I mentioned at last. Contrary to what ordinary people think I consider that successful people go in another way from normal people because, if it is not true, they can be successful people.","The success of a person is given first of all by nature because a successful person, before he had success, he was born with a particular ability in speaking, playing in general and making better wath he had to do, respect other people.",1

But when the plane companies make the tickets cheaper and give people the opportunity to use the plane, people begin to use the plane instead of the car. The other reason why the car numbers will be fewer is the traffic. The traffic problem gets bigger and bigger each day. This problem makes people nervous and it takes much more time to reach a place than it can take. They should try to find alternative ways to go somewhere to reduce the traffic jams. The other important reason is reduction in the amount of petrolium. We know that petrol is very valuable and the amount of it decreases day by day. After some time, petrol will be difficult to find. In this time, people will use cars which work with different products or they will try to use their cars less.","For people, using their own car is much more comfortable.",1

Therefore, many people prefer to spend their time on what is already known. and they work hard so that they can outbeat their rivals. Also, only the ""try"" is not enough. We have to spend more time and energy to improve the invitation. And the improvement part is more annoying and complicated. If he or she is one who is only willing to spend their time finding or inviting something new, but too lazy to improve it, he or she will not succeed.

827072.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree partly. The whole situation changes from time to time and through globalization there have been a lot of important changes in society. Young people definitely have more possibilities to spend their free time on things they really like and therefore one could easily say that there is a big change in the behaviour of young people. Furthermore life becomes faster and that is why everybody, not only young people, has to think better about how and why they do the things they do and if it is the best they can do. Besides that it differs from age, religion and place in society how active or passive young people are in their communities. My own experiences are that I myself help a lot in my community and lots of my friends do so too. An other point one has to have in mind is how young people feel in the community. If they are happy with the world around them the help of young people is logical, but if they have no friends and fun at work it is logical that they are not willing to help the community and prefer to sit in their room next to the computer or television. Besides that the government could try to make help and work of young people more public, so that young people can see, that they can help and perhaps can have a better feeling throughout that, what they have done. For me it would be important to show which goals young people can achieve.","Finally it seems as if young people are lazy and do not give enough time to help their community, but in my opinion nothing has changed and nothing will change.",1

That gives them the opportunity to improve some of them. Is that more important for a student to understand what he is learning, or just to keep things in mind without any explanations or added value ? On the one hand, I think that it is essential for a student to understand what is being taught to him for the simple evidence that he will better keep it in mind. If we take the example of an economic classroom, it will be more efficient for the student to understand the concept of "" liberalism"" for instance by understanding the way it works and its features, than just knowing the fact that this is an economic way in opposition to others as "" socialism"". But on the other hand, it is sometimes difficult for a student to understand every aspect of an idea or a concept.

First of all,when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel,you can only see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group. You can not find out around the city. Everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide.

It is not a fact which is proved scientifically that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As for me, when you get older you will learn what kind of facilities and activities make you happy or unhappy. Because of experiencing more than younger  people, being older has lots of advantages. Firstly, young people are more interested in trying new things. But it is not sure that they will enjoy what they do. They will experience an action to learn something. Sometimes this can lead young people to be unhappier than before. On the other hand, when you become older, I am sure that you will be more clear about new things.

10670.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Here are three reasons to support my agreement. The first reason is that the idea is the most important one of everything. Only when you know the main idea about it, can you think about more details and ask more questions. Furthermore, the concepts are the main body of the lesson or something like that. You should understand the concepts and after that you can learn other information. For example, if a student can't understand the idea and concepts of the chapter in accountingclass, he doesn't know what this chapter istalking about. Then, he gained nothing on accounting class. The worst thing is that he will fail the course. The second reason is that understanding is more basic than learning. You can learn something after your understanding. For instance, in order to learn how to read, you should understand what reading means. It means you should see the words in the paper and say them. Therefore,you must gain the idea and concepts of reading. After understanding those, you can learn other things such as different kinds of reading methods and how to read. Moreover, when people are talking about reading, the first thing that appears in your brain is the meaning of reading. It is the basic one. The third reason is that ideas and concepts are always put in front of the book such as an outline. You can know what the author mainly mentions in the book because of the ideas and concepts. Then, you can read the book from the first page to the end and learn the details and facts. Generally speaking, it is normal when you read books and learn them. On the whole, you can't learn the details and facts without having known about the ideas and concepts. It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Sometimes, it is enough for them to know ideas and concepts.",There is no need to learn facts.,1

That means, they lost their leisure time to be together with their communities. They don't have any chance to know what happened to their communities and also don't know how to help them. Young people lack time to care about their communities because they don't even have time to prepare their work. Second, young people are not so responsible as old people. For the traditional custom, old people will consider communities as an important role for them.","In spite of being busy, they will spend their time in communities and try to help or solve any problems.",1
960227.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I think being specialised in one specific subject is good, but is not enough for your personal development. First of all, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is better to improve your communication with people. I mean, if your knowledge is really broad,you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of different subjects with a lot of different people. Being open minded in your knowledge leads you, most of the time, to being open minded socially. It is important to be interested in several things, that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations, and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point; whatever you actually want to do in life. Furthermore, the more you learn, the more you want to learn (and need to learn actually). The desire to learn can be found if you are specializing in one specific subject, but a single subject may lead you to isolate yourself in technical considerations that no one can actually understand, whereas plurality of subjects makes your mind breathe. It is no longer a question of 'academic"" knowledge, it is a question of curiosity. According to me, acknowledgement goes the same way as it goes for food, that is to say if you eat the same food everyday, you will just be quickly disgusted. Therefore, if you just study one single subject, even if you go deeply through it, you will be disgusted one day somewhat.","To summarize, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can thus talk about more things, and it makes you so curious as if you were majoring in one specific subject.",1

302096.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I do not agree with the statement that young people do not spend time helping their communities at this time. This is not true at all because You can see a lot of young people share their free time in projects to help other people as volunteers for the red cross for example or collect money or food to send to non - developedcountries. People nowadays have more information than before about what is going on around them, in the world. This information is seen on the television, read in the newspaper or on the internet, talking with his friends or colleagues. Another thing is the new technologies that make it possible to communicate with more people and share information faster than you could imagine before about what's happening in a place and the possibility to go to those places are easier. All these things make young people aware of reality and they become aware of problems in their communities and in the rest of the world and try to help in the way they can. I am really surprised when I see young people share their time going to the homes of lonely old people one or two times a week, or when they help in their community to collect food , clothes or money to send to non-developed countries or when some tragedy occurs.",I am really proud of these young people because they are the future of the next generation and they made a better world.,1

343870.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,Knowledge is an important thing for a person's life. According to many people; specializing in one specific topic provides them with several opportunities to express a subject but i strongly believe that having broad knowledge is more advantageous. You can work on many topics; you can demonstrate your knowledge to others and you can improve yourself; First of all; if you are familiar with some kinds of topic; you can easily predict the subject and understand the mainstream. And also you can give a speech about the topic eventhough you dont know everything about thesubject. Secondly academic subjects are related to each other so you can find the transitions and you can realize the connections between the subjects. For example you are a professor at a university and your department is biology but a chemistry professor can not be able to reach school so that you can give a lesson about chemistry by using a relationship between these two subjects. Finally; a person wants to improve himself or herself so it is very important to have broadknowledge. For instance a student asks about an academic topic which is not your specific subject you can give an answer to the student because you know many things about many subjects so that the student may consider that you are a knowledgeableperson.,When all the above things are taken into consideration; having broad knowledge or specializing in one subject are not too different from themselves.,1

1537541.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I totally agree with this statement. I agree with this, firstly because I am a forensic scientist, and so during my formation, we had to learn things about all academic branches. For example physics, biology, chemistry, law, etc. But more seriously, it ` s really important to have good instruction, it permits you to express yourself in a lot of conversation and so to speak with a lot of people from various specialities. It is not only useful for public relations, you can use it when you watch TV or read the newspaper, too. Sometimes it`s already really difficult for me to understand what they are talking about on the news on TV. One other thing is that today, with all the media we have, it has become really easy to learn about a lot of academic fields, not really deeply, it`s sure, but sufficiently to understand how the world is going. I can understand people who won`t open their minds to other fields. I am of this kind when you are talking about business or politics. In fact we can`t be interested in everything, but we can interest ourselves in so many things that it would be a shame not to profite fromthis opportunity. Just to put a tragic accent on this essay, we can say that the lack of knowledge is what leads to all the extreme nations our world has known as fascism or really hard communism as in the ancient SovietUnion.","In fact, if Hitler had learned to know the Jews and if the inhabitants of the ancient Soviet Union had known what was going on outside the Union, these ``terror`` nations wouldn`t have lived so long!

Knowing events in the past gives him new opinions about what will happen to people. Having broad knowledge of one specific subject helps people to find a job.

I agree that it is more important for students to get ideas and concepts than learning only the facts without understanding for many reasons like the belief of the subject and acquiring the ability to apply the concepts withunderstanding.

Just knowing the ideas and concepts does not directly mean we have the understanding of the topic and having the opinion to act on it. Thinking about the controversy over article 9, the argument about whether revising it or not. Surely, understanding its history which has kept our country peaceful for 60 years, and its idea and concept of renouncing war after the tragic memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is very important. But by just ""understanding"" the ideas of inequality of it, we cannot protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism. So what are we needed to live for? We are strongly needed to be ""learning"" the facts of the Japan facing now, and the ways we can take to maintain the peace.",What happens when North Korean missiles are launched into Japan?

Technology improvement confirms that public transport like metro trains,delux buses provide convenient transport for many people. Most people from the middle class or lower class prefer to travel by means of this transport and save their money over the high rate of petrol or diesel. If the government keep on providing this high technology transport or some better transport than we can hope some decline in the number of cars present. Now a days many people are having satisfying jobs. This increase in employment gives a hint that most people will go to have a good salary in future.

893302.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts because without them they will never understand the facts. I can explain it much better with an example:if you understand the concept of gravity you can understand why we can' t fly, but if you only know the fact that we can't fly you don't know the concept of gravity. You can understand that there is something more but without some further facts you can' t find the concept. But at the same time facts are very important for a student. We live in a society that forgets the past in a very easy way, the more we go on the more we forget and school is not good at giving us the information. I also know it is difficult to give us all the information because there is so little time but the few arguments that they have chosen for us are not enough. In Italian schools, for example, we study for many years the Preistoric period, the Acient, the Middle age. The Story! But when we finally arrive at study, at the latest year of school, the recent story of the world and of our country we run and at least we arrive at the first period after the Second World War; now we are in 2007 and there are fifty years of facts that we don' t know well and for this we have a not culturate class of people that will govern us.","This is only an example to show how facts, in my opinion, are much more important to understand than ideas and concepts also because if you learn much better the facts, from them, you will recognize also the ideas and concepts that are unified to them.",1

Without having any health issues, nor special disabilities that old people might have on a daily basis, I am just so concerned about my future that it does not permit me to appreciate the enjoyment of life. As young people, your entire life is devoted to the preparation of the future and to how to cope with the responsibilities that accompany life as an adult: young people have to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the apartment to have a family and to afford it. This is why a young person might go through his youth without enjoyment. As an example, most students do, during their studies, a job or an internship, to have money for some higher studies or to complete them with professional experience that might be taken into account by their future employer. In such circumstances, how can they enjoy their lives as students? They have no time to go to students' parties, or they are too tired. Besides, most of them are conscious that these years were supposed to be the best, as their parents told them.","Young people do not enjoy life like older people do, and they probably enjoy it less than older people do.",1

I would like to refer to young people"", as university students, and ""old people"" as those parents. These days, parents, who have sent their children to universities, tend to restart enjoying their own lives. Until high school, a number of parents consider their children as immature. Although, as soon as they enter university, they change their idea that their children are no longer immature. Therefore, after their children are grown up to university students, parents shift their lives to enjoy themselves. I am against the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do, in terms of studying and relationships between friends. Firstly, young people, who are at universities, have to study a lot. Most of them have lectures everyday, have to make a presentation, or submit reports. On the other hand, old people, have no schools or lectures. They are totally free to spend their free time. Secondly, about relationships between friends. When people go to universities, the first thing they try to do, is make friends. It can be an enjoyable thing, but in return, it might be a stressful thing. They have to seek an opportunity to speak to a new person, and get to know each other. Although, parents, who have already gained a friend, do not need to make new friends. They do not need to experience those stressful times any more. To give a more considerable instance, my mother enjoys more of her life after my entrance to university. She goes out with her best friend more often, goes out with her to see a play, movies, etc. Moreover, she is making more time to spend with her husband. They go out for a drive, or take a walk with our dog.","From these facts I can maintain that parents are enjoying their life, as much as university students do, in terms of school affairs and relationships between colleagues.",1

In the first place, the important reason in support of my view is that young people encounter more or at least the same amount of physical problems than older people do. Both scientific study and empirical experience show us that physical problems are in propitious to the technological levels. Therefore, with these problems, young people have to deal with these new problems before they can enjoy their life, namely, they will not have the same opportunities to enjoy life. For example, with the Internet invention, young people have to deal with all the technical problems in constructing the network or in maintaining the network. But, for those older people, they can enjoy their life without thinking about how this new monster brings about the c. In the second place, young people have to bear more social burdens than old people. Social burdens manifest themselves in terms of social changes. For today's young people, let's say in china, society is stagnating into an aging society. With One Child Policy, the country will say one young couple have to support at least four parents or their family members. Accordingly, young people can not have much time to enjoy life as the older people do.","In the third place, admittedly, young people could face more opportunities to leave a happy life, for example, the joy that the Internet brings us.",1

If you look around you and you see the developed projects , it is because of young people and I consider these developments as a help to communities. I think that kindness is not only a financial or tactile thing , I mean that you can also help your community by loving them and giving them a lot of passion. I am a big example to prove that young people are helpful to the community. I am eighteen years old and I am in a medical college.

They would be capable of solving problems, which is the idea. Education is about what the student is capable of doing, For example, if the student has a bad situation, a problem or other struggles, his proof would be to try to find by himself what he needs to do to get out of the situation. His level of education would help him to analyze the problem and then, solve it. This man will think about what he has learned and after that he will find a solution to his problem. Another example, would be a person without any educational qualifications. This person would not be capable of getting a fast concentration because he has not had any educational help in all his life, which means that he has not developed his reading part at school. For this reason, education is not just a word that indicates ""go to school"" (college or universities, in other cases), it is a word that indicates: ""analyzing"", ""logical"" or ""learning"". If some subject is too difficult for a student but he must pass that subject, he will use his logical skills to solve the problem.

I understand that these children have no interest in helping their communities when they are older because no one helped them.

One thing is good about successful people they already know how to do what they know and succeed with it. Now, they need to move on to another level and have more experience. they also want to come up with a new project which can make them more successful. Successful people should come up with more projects, do more research into their knowledge because the more they know, the more they succeed and it will be worthwhile for them too. It is important for people who have large opportunities to what they know to attract the popularity of success. On the other hand, people with creativity are a benefit to the world because they always come up with new projects and they can handle the future easily. therefore, every body in the world can count on them , such as the government ,health care providers , sections of cultural, sections of education and commercial. Which can make their work easier by coming up with new projects. Successful people who try new things and take risks will be more success ful than other people who are afraid to take the risks and try new things ; because they will limit what they can learn and they could help.

531960.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The teachers teach us a lot of different things. They always teach us that understanding the idea and the concepts of each article is more important than learning the facts. Even though we are students or the teachers. First, understanding the ideas and concepts is to make sure that you know everything about this story or article. If you did not understand what it was talking about, you would never get the facts of it. My English teacher always says that way to me. If we want to learn good English, we should read it more than once to understand the idea. It likes the characters, setting, plot, and the background. When we can get all of the above, we will understand the ideas and the concepts. Trying to read it more than once, it would be easier to get what it says in the reading. I always do that way, because I want to get higher marks for every test or quiz. When we do that, we will learn more when we read.",Learning the facts is not really a bad thing to learn.,1

Specialising in something you can give to your research a peculiar prospect and then increase your field of study. Let me give us some examples based on my experience as an anthropologist. I think they could clearly illustrate what I mean. During my anthropological field work in Cameroon, West Africa, I argued that there were lots of interesting aspects of this African society ( for example kinship, economic or religious systems etc. ). However I Decided to focus my research on witchcraft and sorcery. Observing life in a small village I saw that I could note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric. The occult power was used in a social and economic level. Moreover when I wrote my BA`s thesis I used a specific prospective and a peculiar method of analysis. I used the post-modern prospective on hidden cults of japanese Christians and i demonstrated how these hidden cults influenced the modern japanese Christians and other religious movements.

1721349.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I rather agree and disagree with the statement that 'Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities'. Well it depends on the people and how they take the situation. Young people who are more enthusiastic about forming a community can tend to help more. And they would rather give enough time to dedicate to helping their communities. On the other hand,some people show less concern towards helping their communities. Perhaps they would be rather busy with their day-to-day activities. They would be more self-centred and they would never even bother about helping their communities. It is not necessary for younger people to dedicate much of the time helping their communities,infact a small amount of help can help much better. Sideways people with positive views towards developing a community are more concerned about helping their communities and dedicate their sufficient work to helping them make their communities better. They will organise more effective programs to help their communities. They will arrange more and more effective plans to take their communities in a straight way. The young people should be motivated to help their communities and effective programs should be implemented to motivate people. Moreover some or more young people are more than enough for a community to develop. However the formation of communities helps most things to grow in a straight way. It will also give suggestions to most of the problems. Communities should be developed in such a way that they should drive the people's attention towards them. They can do this by organizing some cultural activities on some occasions. By doing so, most young people will be motivated to help their communities.","So by all of the above points,not all young people are not concerned about helping their commodities.",1
1082728.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"HAVING A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS, OR SPECIALIZING IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT? Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make the students know a little about every subject but it won't get focused on a specific subject. Specializing in one specific subject can make the students know everything about one subject but won't make them know almost anything about other subjects. People choose jobs and they only have to know all the information about that specific subject that they work on. They aren't responsible for knowing information about any other subject. These ways the distribution of jobs is formed. Although this way of job descriptions is formed, knowing everything about one subject can make people bored. Knowing a little about every subject makes people open minded and more interesting. They can look at the world from different angles and since humans are social beings , a little color into everyone's life is needed. If people only knew about one topic and had no idea about any other topic, everybody would be bored. People would only make friends with people of the same job type because they would have no common subject with people of other job types.","If people knew a little about everything and did not focus on one topic, then everybody would have to do all of its work itself and no job distribution would be made.",1
1055139.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts. I agree with this statement. There are several reasons for this. One does not have to waste time learning facts and also experience can help students to learn facts. Just understanding the idea and concept can also help to be more creative. It is a waste of time giving students everything about the topic. They need to run their own brains to understand what the whole lecture is about. For example in an art class, the teacher wants students to create a new tool for thekitchen. He gives the idea about what he wants but if he gives the facts they do not have to search for anything to increase their knowledge and ability as well. They can not look from a different perspective. Experience is one of the most important points to learn something. For instance, you studied for your lesson and you got your driving licence. Without having experience of how you expect to drive as well as the others can. Experience is more important than learning facts. You give the idea and concept. Afterwards they experience it in real life by facing them. Being flexible in our creations depends on how free we are. Just having ideas can help you be more creative. In order to think well, sometimes we should learn facts by searching for them. In conclusion, trying to learn facts is a kind of waste of time and without experiencing the concepts we learn do not help us to improve ourselves.",For these reasons i disagree with this statement.,1
166869.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that understanding the idea and concept is more important than learning the facts. It is because I think it is easier for you to do something if you know the concept. Actually the concept and idea is the basis, if you know the concept of that thing, it is not hard for you to learn the facts. Because the facts are also coming from the concept. For example, a student can understand the idea of the calculator, it is not hard for him to do other questions in the textbook. Like the "" ideas "" are the theory in the Mathematics textbook, and the ""facts"" are the example that is stated in the textbook, you may say it is easier for you to read the example to know how to do the Maths problem. And it seemed to be the fastest way for you to learn.","But I do not agree with this, because I know that learning theories is the best way to answer the questions.",1
1316786.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Broad knowledge is very important in academic life. A person who wants to have an academic career should be aware of a lot of academic issues. However specialization makes people more successful and unconfused. So I do disagree with the statement. First of all, it is obvious that people who have academic careers, should have a broad knowledge of not only academic subjects but also global issues around them. However specialization is necessary for the academic periphery. Let us imagine a professor; when a student asks some general questions about his or her research project, he can answer them but if the student asks some specific questions, the professor can not be satisfied with details. The brain has a capacity for knowledge. If a human behaviour focus on a lot of issues, he or she can be aware of many more things but can not know anything in detail. Secondly, when we look at developing countries, we see that specialization is the main point in this development process. People do what they know best. Without argument it is clear that intellectual knowledge is important in social life and benefits people to have a vision of life. However, in the academic career specialization makes people successful. People have a perception capacity. Therefore people should choose subjects which are in their perception of an academic career. In conclusion, all of those reasons show that a person who wants to succeed in his or her academic career, should specialize in some subjects. The academician can be confused by the other option. People should do their best in their working life. Making the best happens only if specialization happens.","Broad knowledge brings broad intelligence, it can be denied.",1
760612.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"In my opinion, traveling the world with a group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money. First of all, while they give you time to explore places, it's a very short time, so you miss out on lots of things that are necessary. Secondly, crashing a bus that drives for hours and hours without knowing anybody or anywhere just isn't a fun thing to do. Finally, some tour guides don't even know what they are talking about, and don't talk when they are supposed to, so you have to take risks on picking the right time and date. Let's say that you went to an University of Harvard, and they have lots to see like the science center, and famous people who graduated from that place like Bill Gates. So the tour guides tell you to explore places within half an hour which is a very short period of time in such a large place. So while you are looking at unnecessary things, time goes by, and you miss out on the important things like the golden statue. Also if you don't make it in time for the bus, they all complain about waiting for you eventhough it is just for a minute. Eventhough, you go to places with your family or friends, they have lots of other people on the bus who are traveling with you. You could get bored only by talking to your family members or your friends. But some people don't care, because they also have TV's on the bus to entertain you, but it only entertains me a bit. Then all you hear is chattering going on and on beside you and infront of you. You can't tell them to be quiet, because they will point fingers at you and even curse you. The other thing is that if you want to sleep, and lean back your chair a bit, they complain to you about how uncomfortable it is which is very annoying. The Great Wall of China. It has lots of history and legends to it. Surely, people want to know about it, but the tour guide doesn't even say a word about it, and even if he talks aloud, he doesn't know what he is saying. Well i am not saying that every tour guide acts like that, but if you pick the wrong time and date, you will have to face the consequences. Therefore, i disagree with the statement. First of all, the tour guide doesn't give you the right timing for you to explore the place.","Secondly, you barely know anybody on the bus except for people who came with you, and finally the tour guide would stink if you picked the wrong bus.",1

In my opinion, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one subject for two reasons. Having broad knowledge has many advantages for people. It gives people great experience in all fields. By watching, listening and reading about all topics in life. For instance, when anyone is interested in politics. He may talk and argue with anybody in it. Thus, it will let people have more consciousness about everything in their lives.

So they have to consume their limited youth for enjoyment. I have to say such an idea is inappropriate since enjoying life is not a priority for young people. There are many types of enjoying your life, no matter whether you are young or older. Everyone, at any age, can find his or her way of enjoyment. Young people are physically energetic so that they can climb mountains, play Internet games, play basketball and do disco dances. Older people can travel in more peaceful ways like on a cruiser, playing chess and gathering to watch basketball matches.",Some enjoyments are just mission impossible for young people in the sake of age.,1
1663050.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. When I was a high school student, I usually learned just facts. It was a system of korean education. For example, in math class, I could learn a lot of information in a short period. However, I usually got low grades in each test. Because the teacher changed the style of problems in each test, I could not use such factors which I learned before. That's why I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important. Next, if I understand ideas and concepts of problems, I can use them in our lives. For instance, I learned the effective value of electronic products through my physics class. Therefore, I can save on utility fees because I can find which products are more effective than others in the home. Finally, if we knew about concepts and ideas of some accidents, unfortunate accidents would never happen in the future.","For example, if we just know factors of invasion from other counties, the invasions would be faced again because we did not know how to prepare them.",1

Because i don't believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Because the population of the world is continuously growing, there will be more people living on the earth than today. So it means people will need more cars for their requests or anything else whatever you want to call them. If we look back, our past will show us, we are always using more by time. For example, if we used 10,000 cars in the 1920's, we would use more than 500 million cars today. This is only one example, there is always a good table showing us we always use more cars than last year. And it will continue to go up like this. Lets look at it from a different point.

First, we need to have knowledge of people's studies since humans appeared many many years ago as human beings. When humans were just born in ancient times, there wasn't anything but people studied themselves and invented many things so we are now. We need to study their history to study like mass, language, chemistry and so on. Then, If we study many academic subjects, students know which one is so interested in them. It's the most important thing. Because school is providing many subjects, students can learn new categories of study. It's good experience for them.

First of all,every body agrees that successful people are not ordinary people. Because they've found a way to get richness and success while others are still stay poor in either their money or their futures. Successful people usually think differently. For instance,an average person who makes about 50 thousand dollars a year would probably save 10 to 20 thousand dollars in their bank accounts. What a successful person would do is use the money to invest other than put that much money into a bank. That's how a small amount of money gets larger and larger. Successful people think things in advance. They look at the market and they will know what hot deals are going on. They would find out which you can and which you cannot do. They would figure out which worthes the risk to invest in. In other words ,they have the intelligence to distinguish good stuff from bad stuff. Any way,successful people are usually businessmen. My friend John is a stock bloker who works on wall Street. He makes money only out of looking at how the stock goes. He usually works at home, and seldom goes out. But he knows every thing. He gets information from the internet. He's just more intelligent.","Once he knows what the stock will go for,he knows for sure.",1

However is true that there exist other kinds of people that are very competitive with the situation of others and the mayorality of these people are young people. This world is very complicated and is very difficult to achieve individual goals. People have to work very hard, they do not have any time to breathe, to stop and to think in another situation. Life is tough and they have to give an answer about what their role is today. People try to have success, try to demonstrate their worth and work to be the best. They have to study , next to find a good job and to survive in this competitive world. Then they are very tired of spending their time on another task.

9928.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Recently, it seems that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Unfortunately, I can not help agreeing with  this. Including me, most young people do not feel a strong relationship with their communities. In my experience, there are two reasons which make me think that way. First, an athletic festival is held in the community where I live annually, I think taking part in something community event means helping it. I have taken part in it just once. But in fact, I could not find any young people there. I reckon the reason why young people do not attend that festival is that young people prefer to spend time with their friends to family or their communities. I also guess that some young people think contributing or helping their communities is a kind of waste of time. Second, especially recently, young people such as university students tend to live by themselves. Actually, most of my friends live apart from their family.",It means that it is no longer possible to help their communities.,1
1629616.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In my opinion, there will be fewer cars than today. the main reason for this is technological development that makes life easier day by day for today's people. We can also take the oil reserves in to consideration for the decrease in the number of cars. The technological development is so great and unpredictable that one can do something which might have only been a dream in the past like reaching the information he wants just by clicking some buttons. Therefore the development may result in the development of mass transportation and with the benefits of mass transportation ;like the cost and availability ; people will be willing to use them instead of using their personal vehicles. In twenty years there may be some kind of train which can go faster and cheaper than those of today's or mankind will invent a machine which can transport people to another place in seconds just like we watch in the science fiction movies like 'battle star galactica' or ' star wars'. There is another reason why there will be fewer cars on the roads that is the lack of oil reserves in the world. when you think that 99 percent of vehicles use oil for the energy they need this might sound more predictable unless the man kind finds another source of energy like sun or a kind of an element which can be used instead of oil.",It does not make much sense to say this because the scientists spend more time finding other means of transportation than finding useful elements or sources of energy to do the work which oil does today.,1

What is more, it is better for graduate students to specialize in one specific subject. My reasons are listed as follows. In the first place, the majority of undergraduate students face the problem of finding jobs when they graduate from university or college, except for the students who plan to pursue a higher degree. If they have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, it means that they have more opportunities to receive a good job.","On the other hand, it is obvious that undergraduate students just receive a vocational education at university.",1

As far as graduate students, Since their tasks are outstanding in one special field, and they have not enough energy to study deeply in various fields. Therefore, it is suitable for graduate students to specialize in one specific subject. As far as I am concerned, I always believe that a graduate student is a person who is so intelligent that he or she can contribute to the field of science which he or she is studying.","Admittedly, having broad knowledge of various academic subjects is definitely beneficial for graduate students to achieve success in their special field.",1

925939.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Can we say that success and creation are linked? The main point is to make a difference between financial success and personal success. Through a financial point of view. New things are not always successful. Indeed, success as well as failure are parts of the risk. For instance, when you gamble in a casino, you can win but you can also win. Maybe the first thing is to analyze what is to be successful. A successful person can also be the one who tries what he really wanted to try, the one who is not afraid of realizing his dreams. The issue of the try doesn't influence the value of the act. Which is taken into account is the will to realize his projects and achieve his dreams. Therefore, we can say that people who act and react are successful people. They attract admiration and respect from others. Indeed, taking risks and trying new things are a proof of courage. Trying new things can turn a person into a leader. Even if the try ends up being a failure, because it is new, it is always a start for something else new.

1491268.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays, there are some kinds of ways to learn something which have never been done before in personal life. I disagree with the statement that it is more effective to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. People should face the facts about what would be more Important things. First of all, there is no doubt about the fact that facts are composed of real things. Most of them have records or certifications in several ways, writing, taking photos, painting, or existing substance itself like a fossil. There are obvious no assumptions and personal opinions in the facts. Besides, facts would not change their form because they can not be made by human thoughts. For example, the earth exists in the solar system, it is a fact. But some people had ideas the earth was just existing on its own, no system, in the ancient world. Second, ideas and concepts are based on facts. If there are no facts, ideas and concepts can not be born. People tend to add to some thoughts in their own way on the fundamental, facts. In the other words, facts bring human thoughts, ideas and concepts. In conclusion, facts have some more advantages for the study than ideas and concepts that I have shown above.",There is no possibility of existence without ideas and concepts.,1

These people love to take a risk, and like to challenge themselves with these risky things. Also if you get lucky when you take risks you will open a new door for yourself, and you may be successful, and feel happy.

In English class, we read some books and discuss what the book tells us.

63277.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products better than they are. Now we live in a high tech advanced society in the 21st century. All over the world are getting smaller by using the computer. We can exchange information together by all kinds of communication systems such as the internet and mass media. Even though we purchase one item, we try to get information about all resources. For a good example, most advertisements make customers guarantee their products. In order to become good brand products to appeal to customers , the company focuses on better products. We can't deny the advertising's importance in relating good products. Most consumers think that better products are introduced into the televisions, radios,and other mass media. Most advertisements should imply that advertisements' products guarantee good qualities to attract customers. Now most companies recognize that advertising products should be the best products than other ones to succeed in the business. To take the example of Coca Cola drinks, they are not American drinks any more. It is the world drink all over the global village. Without advertisements, it couldn't exist any more.

They have always represented the symbol of energy and hope. Nowadays,young people have to carry a big responsibility from elementary school to achieve their dreams. Since they have many concerns in life,they tend to give shorter time to help their community. I think that this matter is due to the interaction of many factors. The first major factor,is the school's busy schedule. This limits the time given for young people to do community work so they can't be very efficient since they do not have sufficienttime. The second matter, is the increasing number of video games and entertainment that encourages young people to isolate themselves in their rooms and spend hours with technological machines rather than integrate into a club or a volunteering association.",This behavior leads to a vicious circle because the more these young people hide behind their computer screens and games the more they split from society and the community actions and the more they will be aware of the importance of community help.,1
168891.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement, that successful people try new things and take risks earlier than other people. In my opinion successful people know what to do for a well doing business. They are more confident because of their success. I think only the development of new ways and new technologies can make you successful for a long time and that is what they want to have. Success for the rest of their lives. They know that when they stay at their level, maybe the others will enforce them and then they fall down at a lower level. So the invention of new things is also a defense mechanism. I think, if you are successful and you do the same work everyday, then you get bored with what you are doing. For good and successful work you have to enjoy it and if it is boring you can not even enjoy it. Another reason for taking risks is that the people may not lose their jobs when they are unsuccessful. That gives them the possibility to improve new procedures. Probably the fact of being restless and of taking risks is the key to being successful. And when you are successful it is easier to try new things.","Think about a person who sells newspapers the whole day, if he tries new things to sell more newspapers, it could have a bad end for him.",1

How can you help your communities with the time you have? ? ? First of all, in my opinion, I am a student of twenty years old, and I would say that in your everyday life,you never find any time for all you want to do. As far as I am concerned,I would say that giving time to other people, or being investigated in an activity requires a lot of human qualityand a strong engagement. It might not be easy to help our community when you have responsibility at work, at home, with children. In order to manage a good way of living we have to make choices at any time during our own life. Secondly , we can consider the problem from a different point of view. If you are living in a huge town it will be more difficult to help the community than living in the country. Thanks to their small village in the country,everybody knows everybody. The fact of the densification of the population,it's easier and faster to link and create central meetings.

It is not easy to make a decision to take risks; however, there is a massive chance of being successful after dealing with the risks. There are some advantages to taking risks when people do business. First of all, there is your own opportunity to succeed. If you operate a business with an initiated item, there is only success or failure. When a person thinks that the item that he/she has is exotic, other people might think it is, or not. If you read other people's minds and invent an item that other people couldn't think of, then your company will be the necessary or need other people. Secondly, people who take risks, they can save a lot of time. As an example of the most successful person in the world, Bill Gates, he quit the college where he studied. After all, he invented DOS and Windows with his friends and coworkers, he became the richest man in the world at a very young age. Therefore, taking risks could make a person become successful even though he/she doesn't have a school grade. Finally, taking risks not just makes you rich, but it also makes you facmous and helpful to other people. Most successful people who take risks are famous and other people need them. Being rich with business that other people also do may not be too difficult to attain, but being famous and being needed by other people is not easy to achieve.

With the advantages above, it is clear that dealing with risks has more chance of success than doing what other people do.","Taking risks could destroy people's lives; however, if you are born into this competitive world, isn't it valuable to take risks if you can succeed?.",1

1859442.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Society has changed enormously in the last ten years. Now is fondamental to have academic instruction to work. Some jobs are widely spread like those in the economic fields. Some others are more unusual than those in engineering fields. For these reasons it is worth choosing a career well based on what one wants to do. Here in Italy, the university has also been transformed. Now you have to attend many courses and take many exams (about thirty) at the first level in order to be a doctor, in the wide general sense. Making this, you study a lot of different subjects that bring you broad knowledge. Sometimes, unfortunately, somebody can lose himself between too many exams, but other times one can discover what he really wants to do.

1164179.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"This is a very hard discussed question and I believe everybody you ask tells you a different answer about this aspect of the generation gap. But with the tendency that always the other group is accused of being more enjoyable than the one you belong to. So everybody's opinion as a young or older person could be affected by such an influence. Thus I am trying not to be affected by such group thinking. I would say the majority of our society is enjoying their life, although older people do it more. Surely one could say the young are lazy and the only thing they have in mind is making a party. But I think that relates to their younger and more active body and mind. And I am convinced the relatively short time young people party cannot be compared to the long periods the older people sit around watching tv, playing poker, or spending their free time in female chatting clubs. Of course there may be several older people that use their time efficiently by working, keeping the front yard nice or being active in a sports club. There are also people who are ill and cannot do what they have in mind. But in summary I want to make a statement about the mean, the normal, older person.","Young people are simply doing much more, in both fields enjoying and working, than older people.",1
580138.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"There are some differences between young people and older people. I want to explain important points about their characteristics. First, young people are more active because they have to go to school, they have to learn what their requirements  are. They also have to grow to become what they want to be. Though, they are growing up, there are a lot of struggles that they have to face. They are confused and lost because they can not see what is going to happen next. Second, think about older people who are calmer and have knowledge, and go done with their development. They can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school. They may have time to think about their grand children who they got. But there are things that they can not do which is going to school, playing sports beyond their average , being expert at some new thing. So some limits come up to them because their age is increasing. But it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do. For example, if you want to have your own time to relax, sleep, talk with friends, it seems like young people have time for those kinds of things, but young people may not do it because there are a lot of things to do like home work, sports club, planning for university or job. But older people may do it because they have time, maybe they are having a job that they really want to do.

1957836.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements have been increasing a lot during the last 30 years. Does it work or is it just an illusion ? Knowing how much money companies are willing to spend in an advertisement I have to say it must work. Now there are some more reasonable ways of responding to the question. We could talk about packaging forinstance. Between products that offer the same thing, that are at the same price, I would rather choose the best looking one. For me the product aspect reflects its real quality. In this case the true problem is comparison. I don't think you make a product seem better than it really is, the point is making the product seem better than the other products ! I think this is really working. There is another way of advertising a product : getting the buyer to know the product before he even gets to buy it : advertising in magazines and  on television. In my opinion, this may be more efficient because the buyer won't necessarily compare the product to the other ones. He will just get in the store and search for that exact product because he has been told it is the best.",In this case it is true that advertising is used to make the product seem better than it really is.,1
1448728.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"There are people who support the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and others do not support this idea. I would say that I agree with this idea that most advertisers make products seem much better. In the following discussion, I would like to explain the reason with some examples. Firstly, in Japan, I have heard news that some people have died because of using to reduce weight pills. Recently, over weight problems have got bigger in Japan too. Many people want to reduce their weight in an easy way. This company imported this pill from another country and advertised it all over the country. It says that some people could lose 5 kg in two weeks or less than a week. Many people bought it and some of them had really terrible results. I am not sure that pill was the main cause of their death, but I had heard that it works to blood pressure. So some of them affected badly. Secondly, I like to go to restaurants or bars. I can choose from several kinds of foods from the menu. I decided on foods, because they look so delicious and they also have a great range of good prices. However, when I see the real one, sometimes I am disappointed. These foods are totally different from the menu, for example, the amount of food, taste and price. Whenever I see it, I decide I will not come here again. I understand companies need to have more profits from their products. They have to make people want to buy them. The advertisement plays an important part in their profit. However, if they show their product much better than reality, they will lose their trust from not only customers but also their company accounts. And they also lose their position in their field. Finally, I would say that the advertisements should not make products seem much better than they really are.",Companies do their business in an honest way.,1
1688133.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Now, to make the statement clearly, I define the age of each person. I set the age of young people around 20, and the age of older people around 60. I can not decide which people enjoy more because both of them have different kinds of things to enjoy their life. So, I would like to compare some points. The ordinary differences between young people and older people are physical ability , the quantity of money , the variety of experience and so on. Now, I compare these things between young people and older people. First, as to physical ability, young people have more ability than older people.","So, we can say that young people enjoy more than older people such as sports or dancing all night or other things which needenergy.",1
486681.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing familiar things. In my opinion, successful people, especially in the business world, can usually imagine things that will happen in the future. They can also see the trend of life therefore they can prepare for the change of life and try new things that may lead them to success. On the other hand, people who only do what they are familiar with do not have this kind of sight and ability to create things. To be a successful person, you have to be a pioneer to try new things. In the business world, ""Time is Money"". People do not only compete with others, they also fight for time. Time is the factor that determines success or failure. Therefore, trying new things is the key to success.",People who do not take this kind of risk can never be success.,1

Visiting beautiful places all over the world can really rejoice human beings which is easier for young people than older ones as age is a great barrier to making a world trip.

The car has become an integral part of human life. so,i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"". Cars nowadays are more important than we think. In most of the developed countries, people prefer a car as transport rather than other conventional transportation modes, like trains,buses etc. Therefore, they can say that the car has become a vital part of their day to day life. Cars may cause many environmental problems,but that can be avoided by using pollution free fuels. For example, we know that many car companies are developing new fuels that will not harm the atmosphere,like hydrogen fuel which in turn leaves water as a waste product rather than harmfulgases. Many economies in the world depend on the manufacturing sector where the car industry is one of the important ones to generate money forcountries. There may be different kinds of transportation modes after two years, but there will be cars which are more sophisticated and may not use conventional fuels Car industry has not spread its wings greatly in some countries which are developing now. For example, take India. The Indian economy has risen before. so, there is untapped potential in different industries. One of the markets in India is cars. Many top companies are entering India to tap the vast market. For India, there is also an opportunity to generate new jobs in that market. To cater for cars from countries like China and India, it will take many years.

1746249.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Everyone in this world can enjoy his life in his own way. people are different in expressing their enjoying of life. How can we enjoy this life and be happy? Everyone knows that life is not easy and it needs lots of work to be a successful person in it. There are two groups of people who can enjoy this life, such as young people and older people. First, young people can enjoy life in different ways. For example, they can do many things in this life without any responsibility for what they are doing because they know that the responsibility is carried by their parents. Also, they can do a lot of things that older people can't do as a result of health. Young people can do a lot of activities in one day , but older people can't do that. So young people are the right people to enjoy this life. Second, older people can,t enjoy this life like young people. There are different reasons for that. The first reason, is that they are responsible for everything they do. Also, the reason for this is that health can't help them to do a lot of activities in one day. The logic provides these points in a very clear way. Old people had already taken their time to enjoy this life when they were young. So they have to give the chance for the other generation to enjoy their own life. Finally, in my opinion, young people are the right people to enjoy this life. That is because the older people had already taken their own chance.","Also, i disagree that the older people must relax after they have finished their work in their whole life because they are the people who must have other work.",1

That is why people who take the chance to do it,must have an open mind to understand ideas, concepts and obviously to learn the facts of any information. When you are talking about topics like children, you must learn about everything, food, games, sickness, parents etc. so this is the idea, ""children"", but you must learn about concepts, like what is common in them, what is terrible, what is normal in their behaviour, how to treat them, how to talk to them, how to play with them, and when you find all this information and understand it, it will be much easier to do everything with them, so this last part will be the Facts. For example, to coach children skaters you must know first how to skate, then how to teach children , and with all this information you must know how to apply your knowledge tochildren, and during this time you will find that every single kid is different and you have to treat everyone differently. To sum up this subject I must say that any student that is taking any class at school has to memorize, understand different ideas, different concepts and of course to learn facts,to have an open mind and in this way to learn all the information that you are receiving, this is the order in an normal and objective way to learn.",So I must disagree with the author of this statement because I must say that these 3 concepts must be together in a learning process.,1

1230192.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The statement "" Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. ""has several examples in scientific history that show that it is true. One of them is Albert Einstein, who at the beginning of his professional life had strong difficulties finding a suitable job. He ignored his friends who were arguing about not changing his job and went to a university in Berlin where he developed the theory of relative time. Another example (where the meaning of success is different) is the attempts to kill Hitler during the second world war. These people knew how to survive in Nazi society, but they took the risks of being killed because they believed in what they did. From the point of view we have today they were successful. Another side of the same coin is the recent economic  situation. The value of the firms only depends on their success at the stock fairs. As a result the managers are trained to push these courses and they don't care about their employees (it's not a risky behaviour, because everyone does it). In this case success is a question of the definition. But there is another way to succeed too. Doing continuously the work you know how to do well will give you a smaller but steady flow of success. Because people can rely on you it will have a positive influence on your work. My personal way to success is a combination of personal and professional success. On the one hand you must have the possibility to have i. g. a family. That's why you need professional success, with risky decisions that will allow you to earn more money.",On the other hand personal success is never a result of risks.,1
1974554.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people take risks rather than doing only what they know. Successful people do take risks as they want to escape from the ordinary life. I do not call myself a very successful person, but I once took a risk and my life has been better. First, some millionaire famous in one area, once was an expert in other things, and I think that happens because those people know how to master one kind of subject. Henry Ford, the father of the car, once was an expert on watch repair. He worked as one to earn his room rent and to study mechanics. Then he thought about transportation and invented cars. Next, the success is equal to the riskyness. Which means that when you have a high probability of failure, then you have a high reward when you succeed. I am in middle school grade three, since grade two, I have liked a girl. She is in the same school and I still like her. I wanted to say that I like her, but I got too shy when I stood in front of her. When I said that, I felt like falling down an endless cliff that I could never come up again, but when she laughed, said nothing and looked at me, I felt like a mattress holding me from the cliff, so I like her, and she knows that I like her. Lastly, risks are sometimes making something new or re-designing some products. Edison, the king of invention, once tried to hatch an egg, and did not go to school when he was in elementary school. His mother taught him.","When he was grown up, he made a telephone which was already made by Alexander Graham Bell.",1
1716107.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It has been seen that the most successful people are the ones who rather do what everyone does, do new things and take risks. One argument that supports my opinion is basically that those people who are more creative and risk themselves would achieve better things. What I mean by this is that by being creative and trying new things you will learn interesting things that anyone else could have learnt by doing things that they already know how to do well. An example that can illustrate this, is if you decide to take classes in Chinese. This is obviously not a language that a normal person will pick to study, and due to this when you go to china you will be able to learn things that a normal person does not know. Another argument that supports this, is that by not doing the things that you already know, but instead doing new things and taking risks there would be a high range of opportunities to shine. What I mean with shine is that you will not be like the rest of the people, instead you will be unique. You will be able to innovate and bring a lot of attention since what people nowadays want is not things to achievedevelopment.","Overall not doing what the rest do is not in most of the occasions a positive thing to do because at the same time itmakes you shine, it leads you to learn knew things that if you are not open minded they will be to achieve.",1

Only, those who roll in money and live in good conditions of living could buy a car. In today's society,in western countries, the majority of the population have a car. We can wonder if the increase in the purchasing power has increased the number of cars for the last year and if this increase in cars is a reality or just an illusion. To my mind, it is true that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. The first reason for this increase in the number of cars is the increase in purchasing power. Twenty years ago, in western countries, there were clearly two social classes; the haves and the have nots.","So, the upper class outnumbered the wealthier.",1

At the same time, it is also important to learn facts which make the things real to the students and students can easily visualize the things and can develop their own thoughts and ideas.",I had an experience related to how important it is to learn the facts rather than understanding ideas and concepts; therefore I disagree with the statement.,1
1393525.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people. Enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people of all ages. There are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other, all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurrence. Both younger people as well as older people have problems to face in life. Each age group's enjoyment is curbed because of these problems, but the enjoyment is never far away. Lets take the example of a young boy. He does not enjoy it when he has to give exams, study, or go to school. However, he enjoys it when he goes to play, or when he watches television. In the same way an adult (middle aged) does not enjoy going to work, or working around his or her house. But they do enjoy it when they come back from work, when they are on a holiday, or when they go to a party. In the case of old people as well, they enjoy it as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds. But they face problems regarding their health. So this way every age group has its own share of enjoyment and problems. We cannot draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or less as there are various factors such as time and society which decide that. Along with this there is also the fact that one's enjoyment can be another's problem. In contrast, children enjoy playing more and studying less. The adults (parents) have problems with that, which curbs their enjoyment of seeing their child study. When the child is forcefully made to study, then the parents' enjoyment becomes the child's problem.","In the case of old people, their enjoyment is that they do not need to work.",1

I like to travel and I have joined a tour group led by a tour guide many times. But I think I couldn't enjoy my trip. Now I would like to support my opinion using my experiences. First of all, I would like to make a travel plan myself. If I hired a tour guide or joined a tour group I couldn't go to any place wherever I wanted. A tour guide would make our day schedule and we would move and sightsee strictly. I want to take my time to see and know a culture and enjoy the country or city where I went.

44844.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of convenience and obtaining information by tour guide. Both ways of this argument have advantages. However I would side with that the best way to travel is alone without a tour guide because of the free and beneficial experience. Now then I will present this opinion by considering these two advantages. On the one hand, traveling with a group led by a tour guide might be said to bring advantages. On top of that if people travel with their guide they enjoy their tour conveniently. In other words the schedule is already set so people just travel without thinking such as where I am and then and so on. In addition the tour guide gives the tour information whenever people travel there. when I was in high school I travelled in America led by a tour guide the tour guide makes my family feel convenient. On the other hand,. Travelling alone without a tour guide would give many advantages. Firstly, if people travel alone they enjoy freedom and without inference and they can wander anywhere that they want. If the opportunity to travel is given to me I want to travel to the swiss that I want to go to. Secondly, travelling alone is a good choice by experience directly. In other words this is useful for social relationships and social experience. So traveling is very good.","All these things considered, the two ways are both the best ways.",1

585957.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","What will our planet look like in twenty years? This question is in all the conversations about the consequences of what we are doing today. Will it look better or worse? It's not a debate today but one of the interrogations concerns the use of cars, which are becoming more and more accurate all over the world. On the one hand, we might think that the number of cars will progress significantly in the years to come, thanks to economic progress and innovations in technology. More and more countries nowadays use cars : in China, for example, the car industry is in great development, and as there are really many inhabitants, we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive markets in a few years. But on the other hand, we may add that considerations about environmental protection are taking more and more importance, Sustainable development is a recurrent term in speeches and official documents, more especially, of course, in developed countries, which had already known the excitement of car technology and had also already benefited from its advantages. So the point now is to find solutions to limit the damage to cars to the environment, such as the recent alternatives that are developing in France today. In big cities, the public power is making big ad campaigns in order to attract people to use public transport [bus, metro. ] or to use a bike.","So in my view, it's obvious that we would never be able to make the number of cars decrease because of their general use; it's really part of our lives and I think that we wouldn't be able to live without cars, it's now impossible, cars have too many accidents.",1

1136540.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Will there be fewer cars in twenty years from now? My instant reply is no, and mainly because I realize how our technology is rapidly advancing, and cars will change, changing only to make people love them more, satisfying urges for beautiful car models, creating more desires to own one. Looking back into the past since cars were first invented, there's a huge big difference in how much cars are owned. Compared to before when only the rich ownedcars, cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price, considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one. As time passes, the rich will continue to buy more cars and sell their old ones, and at the same time, the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price. With this cycle going on, more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them. And why are the rich buying more and more cars? Generally it's because of the constant change in car technology; the desire for speed and unique designs. A stereotype view of rich people is people who buy cars just because of their looks. Car companies looking at this, will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed cars.",There's a rare chance rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these cars will decrease.,1

There are several ways to support the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than acquire knowledge of facts. Science requires students to think constantly and develop a critical way of thinking. For example, for a lawyer it is more important to learn how to think logically than to learn a set of laws in order to be successful in his career. A set of laws can change within one period of Congress; this will leave the given lawyer who just learnt a set of laws obsolete. He will need to go to university to learn again the set of laws to be useful in his field.

610559.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they get more opportunities to play than older people. Another reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do is that they have much more energies than older people and by taking much more risks the younger people get more chance to experience and learn from their life. First of all, younger people get more opportunities to play than older people because they have enough motivation to enjoy playing. For example, at my age, my friends and I play often. We go hiking, dancing on the stage or in the clubs as well, and we also sing and listen to music, which is alot of fun. However, older people do not get alot of motivation like us, so they basically spend their spare time in their home or in the office where they work.

34393.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Successful people really try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. We live in an amazing world. Things change, people change. How could you be successful if you just go along the road that all the people already know how to do well. Yes, it's true that some things and rules are still right. People need to eat everyday, so I open a restaurant. So how could I not make money. But when others run it too, how can you make sure that you can still make money. So you need to change, you need to try new things,you need to take risks, or others will change, and then, you will just destroy yourselves. Who knows that computers will become extremely popular several decades from now. And people just thought that Bill Gates was such a stupid person. What if he goes and sees and does some law things his fathers just wished him to rather than trying new things and taking big risks to go on with his computer and software. Well we may haven't flown into the sky some years ago, but after the brothers used their lives to take the risk, you see what we can do now. No risks ,no win. That's our Chinese old words. Without the risks, how could we see the new country in the north American land. Maybe some works do not change,but the way we do them must be changed.

1273447.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do. 'There were two main reasons for agreeing with this statement. They were 'variation of choice' and 'passionate'. For the first reason, young people can have more choice than older people do. Usually older people have less opportunities than young people have because of their age and also they have worse health than young people do. Also when older people get hurt, they recover slower than young people do becauseolder people 's cells are too old to reproduce themselves. This has caused older people's choices to become limited. For example, oldies cannot ride a ski or snowboard as young people do dangerous tricks because they have more risk than young riders have. The second reason is related to passion. Young people usually have more passion than old people do. For this reason, it is because of hormones and the different amount of experience. Old people have less hormones than young people have and hormones are one of the scientific catalysts that make the brain excited. As a result of this, even if young and old people do the same situation, their excitement is different because of the amount of hormones. For passionate people, the amount of experience also affects a lot. Usually a beginner has more excitement than a veteran does. For example, when two different types of people have the same girl friend, the amount of excitement is different between a lady and a guy who never had a girlfriend because a lady's guy already has experience of having a girl friend.",This relationship does not change a lot between old people and young people because old people usually have more experience than young people have.,1

I do agree with the opinion that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. First, learning ideas and concepts develops the student's skill of thinking.

So I have had the opportunity to figure out that when people are fairly good at practising an activity, they often try to do different things. There are two main reasons that support my viewpoint. One of the reasons which support this statement is that when one is successful, he often wants to explore other fields to figure out what he is worth. Taking risks, having an other kind of experience proves to be beneficial in that it enables you to know what you can do, what your skills are. Trying new things is a kind of challenge to yourself. for instance , i am quite sure that my brother decided to start playing tennis because it was a way to push out his limits.","He probably thought that since he was very good at gym, he wouldn't be as good at playing tennis!

By which he improvises his ideas and overcome withbetterideas than the other person. So I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I would like to support this statement for the following reasons. First, By understanding the ideas and concepts we get a clear image of the aspect. For example if we are studying a particular subject. In that subject it is important for us to identify the main idea of the topic and the concept involved in that particular topic. By simply learning the subject without understanding the concepts then it will be a mystery for us that subject even if we spend a lot of time on that. second,By understanding the ideas and concepts we are able to know how to live in society. That means we are capable of dealing with the problems and our clients. For example if we want to drive a car, we must first understand the ideas and concepts that mean how to start the car ,how to accelerate ,how to movegears. By understanding all these and these if we practice then it will be easy for us to ride the car,not only just learning helps us. Third, when we find out with new software or subjects, it will be better for us if we understand the main idea and what are the improvements over the previous one then these software will be useful forus.",Consequently the conclusion is that we must learn facts and we must also understand the ideas and concepts that we learn then only then will it be useful for us.,1

I believe that a person should take this risk sometimes and try new things in his or her life because I think that the ability of our minds is unlimited. Therefore, I completely agree with the opinion that says people who try new things are able to be more successful. In our life, getting risk is a fundamental part of our world. No one can expect what could happen to him or her. So, I think it is worth it to try new things, use new media, or meet new people.

For example, the famous actor ""Arnold"", he can be just like any other actor , but he decided to engage in the political world and now, he is the governor of California State.",I consider his decision to be a bold and smart decision because after a few years he would loosen his ability to be good and attractive actor because of his age.,1

When you see an advertisement for perfume with a gorgeous woman taking a bath in gold water, you immediately imagine that when you put this perfume on your neck you will feel like her you will change your life and that men will run after you! And the day you will be shopping you will come across this perfume and it will remind you of the good feeling you had when you saw the advertisement, so you wont resist and buy it. What about the beautiful amburgers you can see on the front of certain food shops? ! They always seem attractive well done with good meat and green vegetables, but when you have it on a plate, what a deception. you could not even recognise the one you have chosen from another! The strategy used to convince people can change ,it depends on the target which advertisements have to persuade.","But all the way ,they have to lie to us.",1

223513.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Most people have to try or choose something they do not Know what will happen after. In fact many people try not to be in danger of not risking their lives. However, there are many people who like to risk actually to improve their lives or to do something important. In fact there are a number of reasons for risk. One of them is to succeed and get better, and the other is to do something different. First, many successful people say the risk is the way to success. Actually, I agree with them but it is one of the ways to succeed because there is a chance of loss in any risk. But I think we should risk it sometimes because there is no chance to find another solution. Second, there are some people who do not prefer to risk for ever. In fact, they have some reasons for that, and the main reason they believe that no one can get more than he will get. I believe that is true but God will help us if we work and do our best to get what we need or want in our lives. So we can not stay at home or stay at the same level in our job without trying and waiting for something to happen.",In fact that can not be.,1
88000.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In the past few decades cars have been the most useful vehicle in the world. The use of cars is still increasing rapidly. There are many people saying the negative aspect s of cars, though I think the increase in car use will go on in the next twenty years or maybe more. The carbon dioxide which is emitted from those cars is said to be a big cause of global warming. This negative aspect should be prevented, but there are still a large share of cars. Why cannot people use trains and other social transport. In that way car users will be decreasing and it will be good for the environment. When I was still a child and did not have a driver's license I thought the pollution the car makes was evil and something that one needs to prevent. After a few years when I got the license the thought of pollution went somewhere else from my mind. It is just so useful. I think cars are like smoking. We know that this is a bad habit. Despite this fact, people just cannot quit it. The usefulness of cars affects the people. No one wants to be on a bus or a train when you see the people on there getting squashed and missable. We think we will use the car,more privately and more conveniently. I believe cars will not decrease forever. People cannot prevent th e desire to use such useful things so we need to think of another way, like inventing a car that is ecological. The amount of car share will be increasing as the population rises.",The decrease in the population is the only way of decreasing the car.,1
1243168.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"According to me the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide. first of all, the best way to enjoy travelling is to go with an other person, It'sn't good to go with a group, because it's difficult to share your feelings and make a plan quickly and efficiently with many people together. For example if you need to shop you have to be worried about the feelings of your group, but it's easier when you travel with a friend or a member of your family to change the schedule of your journey. Secondly, all of your movements during the trip are restricted because you are in a group. For instance, if you have a plan to enjoy eating in a different restaurant, if you will meet many new people, it's not possible to do this in a group because during the trip you are always with your group, so you don't have the time to meet someone and the travel can be boring. Finally, if you travel with a guide you are not able to quit the group and to do what you want to do. You have to follow the instruction of the tour guide it's like travel information that's not good. For example if you go to some country in Africa like Ivory Coast, all the tourists like to go to yamoussokro to see the biggest catholic church in the world, the tourists don't take the time to visit the capital which contains some interesting stuff too. In conclusion the best way to travel is with a partner like a friend or a member of your family it's more fun. On the other hand, that depends on what you are planning to do and what's your purpose is. For instance if you want to travel for a history class or whatever.",I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,1
