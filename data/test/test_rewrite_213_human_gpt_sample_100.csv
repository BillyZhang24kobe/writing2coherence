1600455.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I am 22 years old now, that means I should be included in the ""young people"" used in the statement. That makes me think about how my life is going. I ask this question to myself. And my answer is to agree with the statement. I think young people, including me, do not or can not give enough time to helping their communities. I will show my points in the following. The question asks using ""young people nowadays"" in the statement, therefore, I should compare the young people in the old time with them in the present, particularly in the situation of their families. I study at university 4 times a week and I work at the restaurant 3 times a week constantly. Moreover, I study English for graduate school everyday. That shows that I can not have enough time to help my family because I am too busy to do it. But typically in Japan, women did not go to University to help their family and to learn how to be housewives.",The environment that both young people in olden times and nowadays have changed.,-1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore, The environment that both young people in olden times and nowadays have changed.",The environment for young people has changed significantly from the past to the present.
84912.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Scientists often make predictions about future changes in society, especially when it comes to technical innovations. Indeed, it is imaginable that in future years, people will use fewer cars than nowadays. However, I would not fully agree with the statement. On the one hand, it is true that the public transportation system gets better. Especially in highly populated areas such as huge cities, public transport becomes better integrated into the town's scape, just think of Berlin, Hamburg, London or Paris. There, it is more comfortable and much faster to take the bus or the underground. Another development speaking for fewer cars is the sinking travel costs. In recent years, it has become much cheaper to travel by train or plane. Companies like Ryanair or Vogtlandexpress, a competitive train brand, offer very good travel , even within Germany. So it could be a logical consequence that car transport will be used fewer. On the other hand, do both theories work for areas with a high population. If I think about my home town, the public transport system is nearly underdeveloped compared to Berlin.","Since the main part of Germany or other industrialised countries does not live in the huge cities, people will need cars to get from their home to the workplace.",-1.0,1.0,,,,,,,"Since most people of Germany or other industrialised countries does not live in the huge cities, people will need cars to get from their home to the workplace.","Since the majority of people in Germany and other industrialized countries do not live in large cities, they will still need cars to commute from their homes to their workplaces."
1162369.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I believe this statement is true only in part. Younger people nowadays are involved in a variety of activities for their social and cultural development, and it is hard to find time to help the community. Schools take away the most part of the day and personal study takes away another big percentage. The rest of the day is used by young people to relax or to have fun. A critic reader might say that these aspects are secondary, but it is not totally true. In a culture where social pressure is so stressed and everybody has to reach high standards, the time used to relax, think, and have fun is fundamental. Young people today are more stressed than young people of fifty years ago.",I believe this is a basis that is hard to demolish.,-1.0,,,,,,,1.0,I believe this is a basis that is hard to argue against.,I believe this is a foundation that is difficult to challenge.
1127260.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Everybody could tell you this : young people enjoy life whereas older people don't. To me, it can't be absolute, for several reasons. First, we know that young people know how to have fun. They always go out with friends, they always laugh ( most of the time for nothing). Older people don't know it. They used to know but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities, adults always think about their work, adults always worry about everything,,,and when they are older, they worry about death and always talk about when they were young, when they knew how to enjoy life! We also could say that young people enjoy life because they don't think about the future, they seize the day. That's true but older people, if they like to plan everything can seize the day too. Don't we say that the better time of your life is when you don't work anymore? What about these grandfathers and these grandmothers who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want? That's why I think middle aged people are the ones who enjoy life the least. They have too many things not to forget, too many things to do, too many things to care about. Young people enjoy life because they have nothing to think about! They go to school, go out with their friends, have complicated relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends and that's all. OK, they have to do some homework, but that's not a horrible life. They enjoy life because their life is perfect! To finish, I would say that although they have a perfect life most young people don't really enjoy life. Adolescents are always in a bad mood, they complain everytime, they always disagree with you, but what they do the best is ""to not care"".","But older people, even if they have quite a more difficult life, know the value of life.",-1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,"However, older people, even if they have quite a more difficult life, know the value of life.","Older people, despite having more challenges, truly understand the value of life."
1687239.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"doing something which is very different from other people lies the secret of success for successful people. successful people wont keep on doing something which they already knew. taking risks at the right time is a very important strength for a successful person to become successful. for example,the biggest business magnet in india has been successful with his talent throughout his life time. even though he is not a graduated person,he could establish a world no one cloth factory. the main secret behind him is that he always used to change his business from one to another.",and now he is the richest person in India.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Now, he is the richest person in India.","And now, he is the richest person in India due to his ability to adapt and innovate in his business ventures."
584940.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Nowadays, we can see lots of young people who go out with their friends, go to the movies and enjoy parties. Some young people think that they are the happiest people in the world. Youth are more active than older people and look forward to enjoying their lives. So they might enjoy life more than order do. But in my opinion, old people really enjoy life more than younger people. First of all, old people have lots of experience. They live longer than young people and have many different situations. Sometimes, they had a really hard time recovering from their failure and they had unforgettable days in their lives. Whenever they have a hard time, they don't give up and try to recover it. And by having these experiences, they can enjoy their life. Also, they have more friends than younger people. Because they've already been to elementary school, middle school, high school, and college, they have really good friends who are always with them and help them a lot. During living for a long time, old people could have friends who advised them whenever they had a hard time. So old people really enjoy their life with their forever friends. Furthermore, in the case of adults, they achieved their hopes. They have studied and had many failures to get jobs that they want to have. By having those days, they experienced a lot and finally achieved things that they wanted. So they can enjoy life more than young people. Young people enjoy their life by playing and having lots of parties with their friends.",But older people enjoy life more and know how to enjoy their life because they have enough experience and more real friends.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"However, older people enjoy life more and know how to enjoy their life because they have enough experience and more real friends.","But older people enjoy life more and know how to appreciate it because they have ample experience and deeper, long-lasting friendships."
1169476.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Spending time on a holiday tour is the best way to relax from the stress and pressures of work in such a competitive world. People with lots of time in hand for planning and scheduling tours prefer to travel on their own, but I personally prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. A complete tour package reduces my tension at flight confirmation, booking hotels in cities not known to me and also the head ache of researching about the places that I am going to visit. Also, I get a chance to meet many interesting people and make new friends from different walks of life which also makes the tour even more exciting and interesting. It takes care of my spending as I can budget my trip well allocating appropriately to shopping and other needs and it also saves me from getting cheated in a foreign land. I can visit all the important places of the cities and the guide would help as in knowing about the importance and significance of the places better. In addition, I could be more involved in the group while travelling which would help me in communicating with a variety of people and enhance my knowledge horizon socially as well as give me a chance to learn about different minds.

652944.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I definitely agree, because life is an ever changing challenge , which is shown in many stages as you are growing old, presented itself with new obstacles that mostly come as new things for you, and you will find yourself in decisionmaking circumstances where you have to choose whether you dare to know and do new things or not, based on my own experience and personal thinking, i am taking risks attempting to study abroad, even though i am sure that so far i have got high quality and knowledge from my university to work in a local ecuadorian society, and i can develop my sutdy field, but i also think that focusing on a specific issue related to one s studies will make accesible new technology and methods on the conservation of the environment, at the same time the opportunity of developing my skills in the area i ve chosen, will give me the chance to express my ideas and contirbute to improve our society from practical points of view, i also think that i can enrichen even more my knowledge by hearing other perspective from sutdents who were raised under diferent cultural and environmental pattenrs , but regardles of this there will also be things that i will not like too much, i mean shok culture, new currencies, new lifestyles, new architecture and totally a diferent environment.","so if i did not take these risks i would never know if i was able to face new circumstances and even develop my personal skills, and to find out how far i was capable of reaching , at such a point that it might turn out frustrating and uncomfortable in the future , so as a sum i think the more versatile you can be the better, let alone the possibility of distressing yourself, for example with activities involved in art such as music and painting,or making tours, cooking, learning languages, working in farms, etc.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"if i did not take risks i would never know if i was able to face new circumstances and even develop my personal skills.

499483.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"In the present, young people generally do not want to participate in their community. I strongly believe that if one helps their community, he certainly has lots of advantages. Helping the community brings various benefits to us. of course , the behavior that supports the community doesn't give vast positive things. however the advantage of helping the community can eclipse their disadvantages. Moltly community can give financial aids to the poor effectively and they support discarding negative aspects of society more fast and more useful than individual people trying to decrease the rate of negative aspects of society. Hence if one gives help to thecommunity, obviously he can add power to the community and he is able to affect positive things in his societyeffectively. A community provides lots of experience for someone that participates in the community. because a community creates events that help to increase the positive quality of society. for example , they support varied aids for minor people. they send community members to minor people to give them hope of living.

1436897.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take a risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because if you do not make mistakes you will never learn. People should try and learn new things even if they do not like to do it. Some people do not like to do something strange at least in their eyes because they do not have any experience ofit. Otherwise, how could they write and read if they did not try. Everything will become hard and impossible if you do not try several times to get it correctly. My experience with that when i was in high school, i was so outsider and i did not want to learn new things especially learning the kind of sports as an example. When i decided to play tennis, i failed several times in that time and then i gave up. After I graduated from high school i became nimble when i played this sport before it was my boring sport. Then, i taught people in the club how to play these sports. Learning new things lets people avoid their previous mistakes that they had already made in the past. When people attempt to do new things, it will be hard and boring at first, but it is not impossible. However, humans have discovered lots of things like space, ice ages, and they also make lots of industrial things like cars, machines, and. etc and became popular because of that, so, why not you. Keep in mind that lots of experiments that the scientists did, they already had mistakes with them but they tried it again and again. Eventually, they got accepted because they did not give up or they said it was difficult. People should pay attention to what is going on around them in this world. Lots of famous people make mistakes but they are successful. They are successful because they made a mistake and they also learned from the mistake. When i was in high school, i did not get a good grade.","So, i was so sad because i could not be a successful man in my school.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore, i was so sad because i could not be a successful man in my school.","So, I was very disappointed because I felt that my poor grades in high school meant I couldn't be successful."

96442.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I'm absolutely agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Travel in a group can solve the problem of boredom because you can talk to people who share your common interests as you are. Furthermore,travel in a group will be more secure rather than travel alone especially to those chaotic areas in the destination. And travelling in a group led by a tour guide will reduce the rate of missing famous places and worth seeing scenery. Because a guide knows the place well and he knows at which season,at what time,where the place is beautiful and he can also lead tourists to visit avoid the peak time which is very convenient for tourists. Then, travelling in a group can make a lot of friends during the vacation and can enhance the relationships. OUr human beings are not isolated ones,we need to communicate. And in modern society,whatever organizations or business companies exist even universities all require people to have the abilities to work or study as a group.

1749041.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with the saying that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today, because there is more and more pollution in the air and because, in twenty years, new transportation vehicles will be invented. Nowadays, there is more and more pollution in the air. In fact, governments and ecologists do their best to eliminate that problem. Because cars are one of the biggest problems with pollution's creation that damage our environment, it will be forbidden in the next future to drive cars. Pollution destroys our Earth and kills about 100 species of animals everyday. Moreover, the climate on the Earth changes dramatically, as a result, our flora and fauna are destroyed.

If you want to make it possible, I think you'd better try new things than old things that are too common and oldfashioned. In my opinion, most people who live successfully try new things and take risks. There are two reasons to express my opinion. Firstly, it is true that normal people do normal things, live normal lives and love normal things. According to speaking of successful people, however, they were willing to take risks to succeed. People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes something needs to be changed. We should create new things that will make us live new lives and better lives.

In fact, there are fewer and fewer borders between people, everything goes faster than in the future. in a word : our society lives in the instant. That is why today, many students prefer learning facts to understanding ideas and concepts. Something is true : students are not able to get rid of learning facts. A million diplomas represents nothing without experience in companies. it is very important to acquire practical knowledge and skills in order to be directly efficient when setting up in business. further, factual learning is more attractive than theories and students pay more attention to this way of teaching.

714336.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It is pointed out that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities especially in the big cities like Tokyo where I live, for the following two reasons. Firstly, it is true that for young people there are more and more things to do than for people who lived 50 years ago, for example, watching TV, talking on the phone with their friends, using the computer, doing homework and so on, and that young people do not have time to help their communities. Nowadays, young people have to get a great deal of information to communicate with other people.

1579161.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"As technology has been developed, many jobs and skills have been created. For example, Bill gates who is the richest in the world and has a company that is related to computer programs. The history of the company that is named 'Microsoft' is shorter than the others. But Bill gates knew what the important things would become in the world. And not many people tried these new parts. That was easy client of computer. He invented an easier client. And he spread out to average users. I think that, Like this example, trying new things is a better way to become successful people than only doing what they already know how to do well. Here are some reasons. First of all, there are fewer rivals for new things. For example, there were already lots of coffee shops. So many investors struggled to make extraordinary shops. And they also have to care about the location of the shop and the menu. Because there are rival shops.","But if someone tries a new thing, he doesn't have to worry about the rival.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"However, if someone tries a new thing, he doesn't have to worry about the rival.","But if someone tries something new, they don't have to worry about competition."

189340.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The world we live in is full of variety and differences between people. We share different cultures, different traditions, different jobs, different responsibilities. Everybody is different from the others in his ways of expressing life. The world is a huge stage and nearly everybody is an actor. To be able to communicate with each other we should know about each others' interests , this is mainly based on what we learn in our academic life. It's a vaste subject list. It's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects simply because society requires variety, requires change between all living humans. This is to lead us to communication and communication leads us to knowledge. Imagine a person's life specialized in one specific subject only. No variety, no communication, no expanded knowledge. This is the type of person who communicates with their surroundings only, or most of the time they become "" outsiders"". COMPLETE ISOLATION of society, and this may lead to public danger, or to suicide. It's then preferable to be an open person. Meeting different people with different interests and seeing different aspects of life. Imagine a man specialized in complex physics and only complex physics, can you draw a life for this kind or people? it's very difficult for him to build a family, to communicate with his wife, children, neighbors, friends.

There are many reasons to explain my opinion of disagreement that the most advertisements make products seem much better than the real one. one reason is users and the other reason is showing the products to people. As we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people. The first reason is users. as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies. Most companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or users buying the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year. For example, if I have a company, I will provide good products to the people, and I will advertise my products in a good way as it is. The advertisement will show my products to more and more people.

255543.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"There is no denying that travelling in groups led by a tour guide has become controversial, not only for the professionals but for the public as a whole. Some people prefer travelling that is in groups and is led by a guide, and would like to put an end to it, while others do not think this is the best way. As far as I am concerned, I contend that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. The reasons supporting my assertion will be shown below. First of all, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun. Both common sense and our experience have informed us that if many people stay together, they will be happier and can have more fun. For example, when we travel in a group, we can share our funny stories, chat with one another, and even play some interesting games.

1044359.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Do you want to live a successful life? If you want to make it possible, I think you'd better try new things than old things that are too common and oldfashioned. In my opinion, most people who live successfully try new things and take risks. There are two reasons to express my opinion. Firstly, it is true that normal people do normal things, live normal lives and love normal things. According to speaking of successful people, however, they were willing to take risks to succeed. People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes something needs to be changed. We should create new things that will make us live new lives and better lives. Secondly, maybe all of us know 'life is a venture'. It is such a famous sentence that we could hear before. But the case that it comes true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake by trying new ventures. But I think avoiding ventures to keep them from failing is the worst thing in your whole lives. You don't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new.

Which one is more important, learning the particular facts or acquiring the concepts and general principles. It is a matter of balancing the pros and cons of these methods, the decision, therefore, is not easy to make. In my opinion, ideas and principle concepts are more important. the first and foremost reason in support of my position is that it is impossible for us to learn every fact during our limited lifetime. Take mathematics as an example, we could not do all the measurements for the three lenths of every triangle and it is easy to make some mistakes. However, we could just calculate the length precisely and quickly by using the principle.

Some young people think that they are the happiest people in the world. Youth are more active than older people and look forward to enjoying their lives. So they might enjoy life more than order do. But in my opinion, old people really enjoy life more than younger people. First of all, old people have lots of experience. They live longer than young people and have many different situations. Sometimes, they had a really hard time recovering from their failure and they had unforgettable days in their lives. Whenever they have a hard time, they don't give up and try to recover it. And by having these experiences, they can enjoy their life. Also, they have more friends than younger people.

There are many reasons to explain my opinion of disagreement that the most advertisements make products seem much better than the real one. one reason is users and the other reason is showing the products to people. As we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people. The first reason is users. as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies. Most companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or users buying the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year. For example, if I have a company, I will provide good products to the people, and I will advertise my products in a good way as it is. The advertisement will show my products to more and more people. So, most advertisements make products seem like the real ones. The other reason is that the advertisement is used to show the products as they are without adding anything that makes the production seem much better than it really is.

These people are successful because of the experiences and the time they have devoted. This essay will explain why successful people take risks and try new things. I agree that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I believe that experience is a key to success. By having various experiences such as difficulties. You can learn lots of things that you have never learned before. In addition, experiences make you mature and shape you up. By having lots of experiences, you can find another interest that you have never thought of. For example, one of my friends loves to sing but does not know how to dance. She never dared to dance infront of people. She believed that she was not qualified to dance and thought her body was not flexible. Even though she suffered from her tactic schedule, because she wanted confidence she finally learned how to dance, Moreover, her experience of dancing allowed her to use her dancing skill whenever she goes to a party.

569370.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"i disagree with this statement. That is because, there are several reasons. one of the reasons is that if we traveled in a group and were led by a tour guide, we could not get interested in planning where we wanted to go and where we wanted to stay. usually the tour had some schedules and there were no private things. all of the time we have to spend time with other people who we did not know. you may say making new friends is a very good thing but it is not always possible to have a wonderful time with them. i think that travelling with people who are understanding eachother very well is better. the tour guide is very useful for travelling, but we have to allow the rules of the tour that we do not want to. i want to travel more freely and i want to make a lot of memories in my own style. and the next reason is my experiment. last month i went to Hokkaido for the school trip with my class mates and we used a bus all three days of the trip with a tour guide. before the trip we had a lot of plans for the trip but the school trip had to allow the school style which had a lot of rules. we went to some place with her and we were told many things by the tour guide, but i felt that it was not interesting.",i felt that if we could plan the schedules of the trip might be we could make more original memories of the trip.,-1.0,1.0,,,,,,,i felt that if we could plan the schedules of the trip we might be able to make more original memories of the trip.,"I felt that if we could have planned the trip's schedule ourselves, we might have made more unique and memorable experiences."

1799186.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I stand behind the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. There are three reasons: changed society, health and the internet. First, comparing it to some decades before to the present, society has completely changed. Old timers spent time on themselves to live somehow to earn as much money as possible when they were young. However, young people these days are given almost any goods which are essential for everyday life when they are born. Therefore, young people can spend their time enjoying themselves. Secondly, although in order to enjoy life, people should be healthy, older people are more likely not to be healthy than young people. If they are sick, even if they are very optimistic people, it is usually hard for people to enjoy their life enough. Lastly, in present circumstances, in order to enjoy this worldwide and borderless society, people need to operate a computer and use an internet service enough. To operate a computer is a kind of hard for older people. For instance, my father who is 65 years old can only type with his right hand so he spends a lot of time operatinga computer. Also on the occasion of the computer being crushed, my father, one of the older people, couldn't solve the situation. On the other hand, young people are more used to using a computer and know much about it and the Internet.","In their age, computers have no more complicated material than mere everyday staff like a microwave.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,1.0,"Moreover, computers are more complicated to use than everyday appliances like a microwave.","In their time, computers were not more complex than everyday appliances like a microwave."
1316002.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement. Young people are becoming more and more selfish everyday. They are beginning to care about themselves only. There are mainly three important reasons for not giving enough time to their communities; they have more duty every day, they become to care about themselves only, and the degeneration of communities. The first reason why young people do not help their communities is they have more and more duties every day. If we look at the past, we see that life is more simple. People do not have to do lots of work at the same time. But life is becoming more and more complicated everyday. For example, a child begins to go to school at three years old, and he keeps going to school at the age of twenty two. Maybe he had to work when he was a student. This gives lots of responsibility to the young and so he does not have time for helping other people. The second reason is that they have become more selfish compared to the past.

As we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people. The first reason is users. as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies. Most companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or users buying the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year.

1999007.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, more and more people go abroad,no matter whether it's children or old people. because they realize that there is a lot of knowledge that we should learn. There are many new things,new cultures, and diverse knowledge. I think it is much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. In the following, i will list some reasons of mine. The world is changing all the time, All countries are becoming much stronger and stronger. People are the most clever animals in the world because they are learning , we learn the skills to support our life. We make fire,because we want to eat delicious food; we make plans and cars ,because we want to go far away and have more convenience. If we don't learn the diversity skills, maybe we will all still be wearing bad clothes and living in holes. Learning different knowledge should help us to be much better. There is one story that i want to tell you. Long long ago,there was a clever boy ,no matter what he saw ,he could remember it and could learn it fast,all the people thought he was a special person,he would bring good luck. his father was very happy. One day his father had one idea,he could make money from it, because there were many people who wanted to see the clever boy ,. So after that his father limited the boy to going out and ordered him he couldn't learn ,just make money. To a day after a day ,a year after a year,the boy didn't learn any thing, so he wasted time and everything , In the end ,he was also a formal person , couldn't remember many things and couldn't learn things fast.","from upong the material,we know that if people don't learn knowledge ,we will back up to the past,we will still stay in the same place, and learn the one specific subject is also not a good way to learn.",-1.0,,1.0,,,,,,"from above material,we know that if people don't learn knowledge ,we will back up to the past. we will still stay in the same place, and learn the one specific subject, which is also not a good way to learn.","From the story, we understand that if people don't continue to learn and acquire knowledge, they will regress and remain stagnant.

1090349.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"As you know, some people are so busy because of their lives especially young people. There are a lot of things to do in their lives. Sometimes they work long hours and they can't take their time. Some of them work hard but it does not depend on their jobs. These days, people work hard because time is very important for them. They want to use exact time in their jobs. During this period they can forget to help their communities. I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. First of all, young people have a lot of things to do. Business is very important in their lives. They want to have a perfect life and to be good family people. They work in a hard or an easy job and time is limited for them. Their community is a second thing because of their own job lives. Secondly, young people want to give time for their own time. They do something to relax. For instance, they go somewhere during their free time. they have some kinds of hobbies and some young people want to be alone. They can help themselves. There is no time for their communities. Finally, young people's rythm is very different or changeable. This situation depends on their own personal properties. some of them are very workaholic, some of them are very lazy. Furthermore, environmental changes affect them. They can change easily about their behaviour. Indeed, something is not important for them. They do not have a good relationship between them and their family or friends. Most jobs or jobs can affect them easily. They can forget what they have in one family or friends. In brief, time can be hard because of some specific reasons to give enough time to helping someone.","Indeed, giving time to help someone depends on our hand.",-1.0,,,,,,,1.0,"Indeed, giving time to help someone depends on us.","Indeed, dedicating time to help others is within our control."

However, I disagree with the idea that young people are pouring their time into sharing difficulties and helping their neighborhoods because they are likely to concentrate on their private things such as enjoying their lives, earning money, and studying some subjects.

I saw an advertisement that talked about an mp3 player, the advertisements said that the mp3 player can continue playing mp3 for 20 hours, but most people bought it and found it can only play for 16 hours or less, So they asked the company to give an explanation aboutit. The company's explanation is that when it plays songs, it has to turn to the lowest voice and can not change songs, so it can play for 20 hours. But it is impossible for a user to do something like that, when they turn to the lowest voice, they can almost not hear it. And changing songs is very common for mp3 players. I had seen a lot of advertisements like this. So the products were not that good as the advertisements told us. The advertisements' purpose is to let us buy the product, So the advertisements tell us all the good things about the product, but will not tell us what the product is not good at.

Simple statements not deriving from philosophical thoughts, just simple expressions of every day life observation. I think that it is possible to explain such a cliche by giving some examples that truly confirm the point. Young people have more time than adults to enjoy their life. Usually young people go to school and have the opportunity to meet people of their age. Sharing school-time makes young people eager to play sports together, to go out at night together and enjoy life.

On the one hand I agree with this idea but on the other hand I think it is not true. Of course young people usually have no responsibilities and serious problems to be sad. They play games and they live without thinking about their future. Young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragic events of life. This time is the best period for dreams, and young people think that they have all their life to do what they want. When we become older, we lose this part of the dream which characterizes young people. Death and illusions have destroyed our part of innocence. But I can barely believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Happiness depends on lots of factors.

As we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people. The first reason is users. as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies. Most companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or users buying the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year.

The other reason is that the advertisement is used to show the products as they are without adding anything that makes the production seem much better than it really is. In addition, the advertisement is a good way for people to have good products in homes. For example, the advertisement will show the advantages and disadvantages of the product. If it has a disadvantage, the advertisement will show its disadvantage, because if the advertisement does not show the advantages and disadvantages, the company that makes the advertisement will lose its users and people. finally, I disagree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.",the above two reasons explain my opinion about advertising.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"In conclusion, the above two reasons explain my opinion about advertising.",The above two reasons support my opinion that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are.

First, ideas and concepts make a new fact in the future. why do students study? I think that studying stands for making new things in the future. If we learn facts, we will only correct or stop the failure and repeat success. Facts cannot make a new idea and concept. but ideas and concepts can make unlimited new facts. Second, facts are sometimes sad things for students. Students have a tremendous possibility to make new ideas and concepts for facts. Young students are very sensitive about emotional matters which happen in the real world. Bad facts sometimes affect young students. Because young students have a big curiosity. They want to make sure the fact is true or not. Third, facts sometimes easily make misunderstanding of to stand for the fact. If we learn only facts, we can't understand the idea and concepts of the facts.

1100356.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement. In my opinion there is a famous saying that ""TO GET SUCCESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISK"", i agree with this statement because i feel that success does not come without taking risks in life. Today is the world of competition and to compete in this world you have to try new things to achieve success. In order to achieve success ,sometimes you try to find new ways. By going in those ways you think you can achieve success and you often take risks in your life. i feel if people only do those things which they think they know how to do well they can achieve success upto a certain level but cannot achieve heights of success. In my opinion every one has his own definition of success and it depends on the person to person to what extent they can take risks in their own life ,for some people success means peace of mind or a happy life. But for some success means reaching the heights of the world,to conquer the world so that person tends to take more risks compared to that person who is happy in his own world ,or to that person who has different meaning for success. For example ,if you take the example of cricket, if a batsman wants to score quick runs he has to play slodgy shots in order to take quick runs so he has to take risks. sometimes he achieves success or sometimes he fails.",so it just depends on whether the person is ready to take the risk in terms of getting success ?

666.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. But from my point of view, the opposite is the truth. I think it is hard for a young man to enjoy his life better than an older man. First of all, nowadays few young people are aware of the purpose of their lives. It is hard to say that a person can be happy without knowing the purpose of his life. Instead, many of them idle their precious time. They do not know what they should care most about in their life. Older people, on the contrary, know exactly what their purpose is. So they do not care much about other trifles as young people do. They know how to set up a goal and keep chasing it. This is what I envy older people most. One of my cousins spent two years in college and tried to find her favorite major. But even now she cannot make up her mind because she changes her interests so frequently. Furthermore, young people are not mature enough to control themselves. So they make more mistakes. Many young people do things just out of an impulse,. Sometimes it can be dangerous to do things this way. As for older people, most of them know clearly what is right and what is wrong. They have their own judgements and they can often do things according to their life experiences. No wonder our young people always need an adult to teach us right from wrong. Finally, young people are much easier to give in to temptations,especially in today's society. They are not steady enough to avoid the bad effects of many negative things in our society. But as for older people, they have seen much more than us, so they know when and how to say no to temptations.","So, I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore, I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person.","S: Therefore, I believe that older people find it easier to enjoy life compared to younger people."

But it is impossible for a user to do something like that, when they turn to the lowest voice, they can almost not hear it. And changing songs is very common for mp3 players.

1579161.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"As technology has been developed, many jobs and skills have been created. For example, Bill gates who is the richest in the world and has a company that is related to computer programs. The history of the company that is named 'Microsoft' is shorter than the others. But Bill gates knew what the important things would become in the world. And not many people tried these new parts. That was easy client of computer. He invented an easier client. And he spread out to average users. I think that, Like this example, trying new things is a better way to become successful people than only doing what they already know how to do well. Here are some reasons. First of all, there are fewer rivals for new things. For example, there were already lots of coffee shops. So many investors struggled to make extraordinary shops. And they also have to care about the location of the shop and the menu. Because there are rival shops. But if someone tries a new thing, he doesn't have to worry about the rival. As I stated about Bill gates, when the new company developed new things, there were no rivals. They didn't worry about challenging other companies. So Bill gates concentrated on his new things. Secondly, only doing what they already know how to do well is more dangerous than trying new things. As age has changed, important things have changed.

1881363.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There is an argument regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Personally, I agree with the statement for the following reasons. First, broad knowledge will discover one's potential talents. Also, it leads people to grow deeply from many aspects. First and foremost, knowledge from a variety of fields will help people to find potential talents. In today's society, many schools offer as many subjects as possible for the students. That is largely because there are plenty of people who have not known what they want to be. In this case, broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a good experience for the person's future. they can learn a variety of subjects and choose their major from them. To be specific, my brother always dreamed of being a dentist however after he experienced many academic subjects, he realized that he has more talents in astronomy rather than in dentistry. It turns out, he enjoys his job and always tells me that ""people should learn from a variety of subjects to discover what they really want"". Therefore, knowledge from diverse areas is crucial for developing one's talents What is more, broad knowledge allows people to grow into more desirable people. Thesedays, it is common sense that being a specialist in one area is the key tosuccess. However, those people who are successful are not appropriate. Although they finalcially succeed, many specialists have problems with some issues that they do not major  in.

1766936.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The issue at hand is whether students should concentrate on understanding or to ""cram"" facts. This issue is difficult because it depends on the subject. In some subjects like Physics it is more important to practice understanding and approaching theories rather than learning facts by heart. In other subjects, like medicine, both facts and understanding are essential. But to know facts dominates. I believe that focusing on studying facts is the better option, because if they are learned appropriately they will last forever. To study facts intensively and frequently is preferable because it's the basis of your knowledge and therefore the basis of your proficiency. Facts you once gained will be available at any time when required. For example a doctor always has to rely on his / her basic knowledge ofphysiology. If he she had to look up a process before curing, treatment would take too long. In addition, would such a behaviour be reliable? Because facts are the basis of our jobs I think most studies should focus on building reliable knowledge.

For example, I just started to attend a church and started learning about the Bible. If I just study about what God says and the meaning of the word, I don't think I can learn about God and what is more important, and also it will be difficult to have a strong belief.

Some people think that young people use their time more fun than adults, while others think that age doesn't make any connection with enjoying life for people. Personally, I think that age isn't the only factor to check the enjoyment of life. Among many factors that help people enjoy their life, the first factor is a hobby. Having hobbies makes people use their time useful. I have a friend who has a hobby, making pro-models. If he had spare time, he would go to a pro-model shop. He actually likes that kind of making. So, I've never seen him waste their spare time uselessly. I think he knows how to enjoy his life in his own way. Another factor is a friend. From kindergarten's time on, people usually spend their time with their friends. With friends, we did our homework, played outdoors, and struggled with them. We can't imagine life without our friends. This means having good friends helps people to enjoy their life more. I have a good friend. He seems like he always has a fun time with me and our other friends. If he didn't exist with me, I would get stuck in boredom. Whenever we have spare time, he schedules a tour plan and watches movies and sports. Thanks to him, I doubt that I actually enjoy my life more than others. Lastly, having more information makes us enjoy our life more. Without any information, we can't enjoy our life. Even though, there are many things to enjoy, if we don't know these things are in vain. This means we need to get more information in order to enjoy life. I usually read a magazine which has information about the space of a trip or famous tour places.","By using it, I can get many chances to take a trip to a place for which I've ever heard of.",-1.0,,,,1.0,,1.0,,"By using it, I can get many chances to take a trip to a place for which I've never heard of.","By using it, I can discover many opportunities to visit places I've never heard of before."

57433.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Nowadays there is an average of three cars for each family. With ever evolving technology at hand today, the world has become much more connected, unlike in the olden days, people now need cars for many reasons such as commuting to work or visiting relatives of friends living far away. There, of course, are pros and cons when it comes to discussing cars. Cars have increased in number these days for many reasons. Firstly, they are a very comfortable way of travelling, with many having air conditioning, a radio and some even having built in TVs. Cars are also very easy to use and can take the driver to any destination he or she desires. Currently with the increasing competition between companies, car prices have fluctuated. These effective vehicles can take you anywhere at any time, unlike trains, buses and other public transport systems which have defined scheduals and destinations. On the other hand cars have become a liability to some due to their constant need for maintenance and the large number of accidents which they cause, for example, you are 20 times more likely to die in a car accident than to die in a plane crash. The increasingly alarming rate of pollution caused by cars has pushed inventors to try and find alternative means of transport.","The constantly increasing price of gas has led alot of people to abandon their cars in search of another, cheaper, means of transport.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,,"Furthermore, The constantly increasing price of gas has led alot of people to abandon their cars in search of another, cheaper, means of transport.",The constantly rising price of gas has led many people to abandon their cars in search of cheaper alternative means of transport.
255543.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"There is no denying that travelling in groups led by a tour guide has become controversial, not only for the professionals but for the public as a whole. Some people prefer travelling that is in groups and is led by a guide, and would like to put an end to it, while others do not think this is the best way. As far as I am concerned, I contend that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. The reasons supporting my assertion will be shown below. First of all, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun. Both common sense and our experience have informed us that if many people stay together, they will be happier and can have more fun. For example, when we travel in a group, we can share our funny stories, chat with one another, and even play some interesting games. All these activities help us to spend the boring time on the bus or the train. And also, the guide can tell us some interesting local customs which we enjoy. In addition, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is safer. It is well known that thieves usually attack people alone, which situation is easier for them. While if the tourists are in a group, we can look after one another, and can also take care of the belongings when some people go to the washroom.","And also, there are some dangers in some resorts, which the guide knows well.",-1.0,,1.0,,,,,,"Also, there are some dangers in some resorts, which the guide knows well.","Additionally, there are certain dangers in some resorts that the guide is well aware of and can help us avoid."
1090349.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"As you know, some people are so busy because of their lives especially young people. There are a lot of things to do in their lives. Sometimes they work long hours and they can't take their time. Some of them work hard but it does not depend on their jobs. These days, people work hard because time is very important for them. They want to use exact time in their jobs. During this period they can forget to help their communities. I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. First of all, young people have a lot of things to do. Business is very important in their lives. They want to have a perfect life and to be good family people. They work in a hard or an easy job and time is limited for them. Their community is a second thing because of their own job lives. Secondly, young people want to give time for their own time. They do something to relax. For instance, they go somewhere during their free time. they have some kinds of hobbies and some young people want to be alone. They can help themselves. There is no time for their communities.

1938785.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I dont agree with the statement that ""There will be fewer numbers of cars in use than there are today"". the above may not be completely true because of the points that are given below. To stop the usage of cars either petroleum should get scarce and the prices should go so high that only very rich can afford to buy to use cars. And coming from a technology point of view as technology is developing, parts of cars are becoming cheaper as a result many people can afford to buy a car for their own use. So, this indicates a fairly increase in the number of cars than the number that are present now. Also as the newer models are getting on to the market to attract people. people who have cars already send their cars for a lower price as second hand cars and go for the new one. There might be a possibility that if the government want to control the pollution produced by cars. It can increase the taxes so as to decrease the number of cars. But still people may use cars because the government cant lay too much taxes. So, as far as we can see that number is decreasing not likely to occur.",But growth can be predicted because of the above points.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Rather, growth can be predicted because of the above points.","But based on the above points, an increase in the number of cars can be predicted."

In my opinion, I do not agree with this statement, but I do not either disagree with it. First of all, I think that it is better to be specialized in one specific subject, because if you learn too many different subjects at the same time you will be confused, and instead of learning a lot of things you will not learn anything. I also think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because you will learn a lot about the subject, you will be taught everything you have to know about it, and you will know all its different characteristics. For example, if you arrive at university and you choose to learn economics sciences, I think it is better to take different courses related to it than to take, for example, one italian class, one class in modern art and so on. that are not related together.

714336.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It is pointed out that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities especially in the big cities like Tokyo where I live, for the following two reasons. Firstly, it is true that for young people there are more and more things to do than for people who lived 50 years ago, for example, watching TV, talking on the phone with their friends, using the computer, doing homework and so on, and that young people do not have time to help their communities. Nowadays, young people have to get a great deal of information to communicate with other people. For example, in school they can not talk to each other without the same information like in popular TV programs and popular magazines. So they do not have enough time to give time to helping their communities. Secondly, there is little chance to have experience of feeling about commodities especially in a big city. In the big city, people tend to live in big buildings rather than their own house. Several years ago, there were a lot of big buildings and people lived in their own houses. So young people had a chance to play in their communities.

However, I disagree with the statement because of the requirement of high quality of product, and rare bad products from companies. To begin with, any product association requires the company's high quality of product so it actually seems better when people get their product and see what their product has special things on the surface of it than just watching it through anadvertisement. For example, when I was watching Braum's milk advertisement, it didn' t really change my mind from not buying to buying their product but when I went toBraum's and looked up their product's nutrition label and others, it really made me think their product is good and healthy for me.
