1,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts. My choice is based on two reasons. The first reason is that, if you learn facts, you have direct contact with reality. For example, at university, you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than if you follow a lesson of theory. This is a good way not only for a student, but also for a worker. In fact, if a worker has worked all of the day, he or she learns more things than if he or she follows a lesson of theory. I know my uncle's experience can be taken as an example. In fact, he has followed a course to work in a chemistry industry, but he has learnt the real way of working only when he has started to work in the chemistry industry. The second reason is that learning facts helps a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying. For example, I remember that, when I followed the course in the ""Way of Transport"", the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken of in how a naval motor is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built together. To conclude, I don't agree with the sentence because it is not true that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts.","['I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts.

4,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work. Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them. In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures.","[""People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work.

6,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors. But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons why I have no confidence in them, and I will explore a few primary ones here. To begin with, we can learn the ideas and concepts during studying factors. Teachers will be able to teach the student the ideas and concept by teaching a specific fact. Let's take a look at a physics class. At the very beginning , the teacher gives the class a specific problem, and asks them to solve it. The student might not be able to solve it, so the teacher could give some conceptional suggestions that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think about it again. And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept. Further more, why do we learn ideas and concepts ? For practical work, of course. So, why don't we learn something that is more practical? Learning facts will lead us to work directly, and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theories or concepts, and this would save much more time.","[""Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors.

7,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this opinion. I think, in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. I have some reason to think about that. First, some companies are now inventing new cars, like hybrid cars, electric cars something like that. Actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes. We are also interested in cars that are good for the environment. The car industry will change their way of selling the car to customers. Of course, I think of the customer for the environment of the earth will change in this few years. Second, I think that physical translation is not convenient in countryside. For me, I live in the country side, I can not ride on the bus or train when I want. It is different between the big cities like Tokyo and small cities. So people who live in the country side, they use their own car now. I also use my own car. The number of cars in countryside has increased more than before. But on the other hand, now gasoline is so expensive. If this situation continues, the number of cars may decrease.","['I disagree with this opinion.

9,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"For some people, you will succeed in your life just by taking risks. And it is right, in a certain way. In fact, our society shows admiration for these kinds of people. But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank. According to me, it is a lack of consciousness, especially when you are in charge of a family. This argument is far from being useless. When you make the choice of taking risks to succeed in your life, you must be aware of this. To sum up, I can't help thinking that taking risks is a very good strategy.","[""For some people, you will succeed in your life just by taking risks. And it is right, in a certain way.

10,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people and old people have different life styles. As far as I am concerned, young people have more methods of enjoying life than old people. In the following paragraphs, I will reason and provide examples to support my opinion. Young people are full of energy, which means that besides their studies and work, they have much more energy to have fun. Young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and havefun. At night, the dancing bars are full of young people. They dance, talk to each other and drink together. During the holidays, young people drive to the mountains or the sea shore to hunt , canoe or hike. Because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work, they cannot spend as much time as young people on holiday travel. They normally stay at home and watch the TV or chat with their old friends. Young people have more new methods to enjoy life because their brains run faster than old people. Because there is a lot of pressure from the job, young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged. Young people develop new methods everyday and then spread them all over the world. They practise new methods of entertainment and discuss them on the network. On the contrary, old people normally stick to a few kinds of entertainment for a long time and do not want to try new methods.

Big companies use strong advertising and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spend time on the products.

Cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around. They are told to keep their hands from things that are helpless to their grades. Due to this twisted concept, young people are not interested in community activities. Third, the media broadcasts negative examples which stop young people from taking action.

So inorder to save my precious time i surely go on a trip with a. tour guide. If we go to a new place,its better if we have any local person who can call us to tell us about the history of that place. Mostly locals know better than the scholars who did research into that place. Because they will get all the information from their elders. Not only that the tour guide can also take visitors to different parts of the place from forests to rich green agricultural areas. In this way visitors can explore from wild animals to small beautiful local birds. Secondly, a tour guide can show more places in less time. Anyway it may take somuch time.","['Everyone wants to know about the world around him or her for better understanding of different cultural back groundsand also to explore new things.

23,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the rise of capitalism as the dominant economic system around the world, advertising has emerged as one of the key elements of the economy, especially in the 20th century. Producers use advertising as a way of introducing a product to the customer, creating meanings around it, in order to distinguish their products from the other similar ones on the market, to make them compatible and attractive to their customers. There are different ways of promoting a particular product. Topday the advertisement sector has developed a variety of ways in order to promote a particular product. One of them is the evaluation of the qualities of the advertised product. The purposes of the producers for advertising a product are not mainly to demonstrate the real characteristics of their products, but rather to be able to reach more customers and as many products as possible. However, this does not mean that all the advertisements are about a distorted picture of the products that they represent, What really counts for a successful advertisement is its ability to appeal to the customers. One advertiser can create such a distinctive style and tell the truth about the product and achieve success without illusion. Provided that the advertisement is in nature about the biased presentation of a particular product, one cannot expect that an advertisement should be reflecting the true characteristics of a product compared to the others.","['With the rise of capitalism as the dominant economic system around the world, advertising has emerged as one of the key elements of the economy, especially in the 20th century.

Indeed they have to study hard and a lot to be able to find a job. on the contrary retired people have a lot of time they could spend by making holidays or just doing what they like to do. For example since i was ten years old, i have dreamt about what i would do during my retirement time because since that age i have only studied to manage to succeed in my future job without, thus,having the time to enjoy the best year of my life. Second, i think that even though many physical problems add gradually during life, they allow old people to do what they want.","[""Although many people think that only during youth can we really enjoy life, I don't agree with this statement and i will now give some reasons to support my idea.

40,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Many people in the world try to enjoy their life. However some people think older people can not enjoy life, but that is just a stereotype. Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do, such as knitting, watching movies, planting their own gardens. Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to the flowershop and looked for the special flower seeds. And when he got back home, he sprayed the water on the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it. The second reason is that not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots offriends. In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the trip was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend time with their friends and enjoy the time with them. Forthose reasons, old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. In particular my grandfather and grand mother, they really love their life. If someone says old people live their life just boring and nothing special, that is not true, they can live their life what they like to do and spend the time they want. If they found their hobbies and friends, they would live their life better than younger people.","[""Many people in the world try to enjoy their life.

In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took. Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes.

59,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than old people do for many reasons. A young person can do a lot of things because he is physically healthy, can do a lot that old people can not do and because he is young and no one will look at what he is doing. A lot of people think that old people enjoy life more than young people because they think they have experience in life. They think that this experience will make them happy because they have no idea what to do to be a happy person. This may not be a good idea because even if old people have experience they will not be able to use this experience. They become old and harmful.","['In my opinion young people enjoy life more than old people do for many reasons.

60,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main character, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with. therefore, he becomes furious at not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide. This is a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when you are young.","['Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death.

75,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"In our western society, where the individual plays a central role, the community appears to be less and less important, although There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist.

One of them is education. when raising their children, a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion. In this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others. They are self absorbed and selfish, thinking about their own comfort.","[""In our western society, where the individual plays a central role, the community appears to be less and less important, although There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist.

A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people.

Young people are physically healthier and have more energy than older people. People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things.

In my opinion, understanding is definitely more important because it gives the students a chance to explore, a chance to be creative and an unforgettable result. Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topic allows students to go through the investing process. For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literature and find out for themselves that certain techniques add to the perfection of writing. Understanding how they work would give students a better lesson. Getting the concepts and ideas also provides students with a chance to be creative, especially when dealing with are. What kind of art class would it be without studio work? Students should be offered to get creative with colours, textures, moods and all sorts of things. Who cares if they fail once in a while? New creations found in the process of real understanding. Years after years, it is not the definition that students remember, but the unforgettable experience that they learned. Giving out the facts does not provide students with a lot of thoughts of their own. By understanding the ideas and concepts, students gained the ability to conclude the facts themselves. Even if they forget about the facts, they will be able to ""reproduce"" them.

However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things.

They can find the location they want to see simply. However, old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators. Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people. Thus, they do simpler trips while young people travel to diverse places. Old people are not likely to fertilize new machines to enhance their life. Young people usually have more passion than old people whatever they do. I think people need passion to enjoy their life. They have to try to find out how they can have fun where they can hang out for fun. They have to plan some activities. To do all this preparation for doing something to enjoy, great passion is required, However, old people usually do not have passion for whatever they do because they are socially and mentally weak.","['I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play.

How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings. so it was flying in the air. The Wrights brothers are different and take more risks to implement an aeroplane.","['In the above paragraph author states that successful people take more resources rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

114,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"From my point of view, I see that most commercials make goods more attractive and better than they really are. And I found that from my experience and from what I heard from my relatives and friends. Although advertisements sometimes are necessary, there are still a lot of deceiving and misleading things to customers. Also for me is a waste oftime seeing , hearingand reading advertisements. From my own experience I saw an advertisement on the TV about a medicine that would relieve the pain in feet and it was very attractive, so I called for it and after using it for a long time nothing changed. And I heard a lot of stories from my friends and relatives and the same things happened occasionally to them in other stuff that they bought. I know it is sometimes there are advantages from commercials, they will expose as to the new and developed technology, materials and a lot of things. But still there are other ways to know about these things from other sources like departmental research and from the experience of others. I believe commercials were a lot of my time a lot for a lot of reasons, it takes time from me when viewing programs on TV, like news, shows, sports and almost every thing. And commercials also on radio, newspapers, magazines and everywhere. All that is a real waste of time. So I am sure of the fact that advertisements mask the fact of the product and make it much better than it is. I realize they are not for me those commercials, they make profits for me, so I don't agree with the above statement.","['From my point of view, I see that most commercials make goods more attractive and better than they really are.

115,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. From my point of view there are a lot of things that make me feel like agreeing with this statement. For example younger people are usually not that settled or depending on other people , which makes you enjoy life more and live freely. In younger years one doesn't think that much about the difficulties of life that may appear later on, such as illnesses or financial security problems. Furthermore one usually goes to college or university in younger years where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway, apart from some learning times. So yes, I would say that the circumstances in your younger years make it often easier to really enjoy life than in older years. But on the other hand I think- and I can only think about it because I am in my younger years at the moment - older people as well have their very own way of enjoying life. Surely they'll do it in a different way because it's not all about parties and having fun, but with a life-experience I am sure one can enjoy life at a different level. Looking back on what life offered for you, everything you've already been able to enjoy and all the goods and bads you've gone through I think one can enjoy life as much as young people.","[""The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do.

They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it.

Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies. On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them.

The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea.

First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan anything because the tour guide knows everything about what to do or where to go. It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group. When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended. I am sure a tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat, but you have no choice but to eat something else. Even for the food, I want to research what is the most popular food in that country and I will figure out whether I can eat this food or not. If not, of course I will look for another place to go.","[""I disagree with what the statement says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

128,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you. The main point is not to think only about ourselves. Everybody has to care about other people or even animals too.","[""I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you.

130,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with what the article says. Some people think understanding ideas and concepts is important for students, and some people think learning facts is important for students. However, from the fact of national surveys and my own experience, I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students. First off, I agree with the article because a national survey says some countries which teach ideas and concepts to students in math, and history class usually have ranked in high educated countries in the world. According to the article, in some countries, such as Greenland and Hongkong, which teach students ideas and concepts, adults usually have great insight and memory about what they studied when they were in high schools. However, some countries, which tend to teach students just facts, adults usually don't remember what they studied when they were in high schools. Second, I agree with what the article says because if people study just facts, they can't apply what they studied in daily life. People are studying to make them knowledgeable.","[""I agree with what the article says.

The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children. Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study. They are not afraid of troublesome things they feel that they can manage the whole world. They have not always been accepted in society for being problematic and for driving crazy at their parents. They are noisy people.","['During life there are different periods and ages which each of them improve wider differences.

In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind.

Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail. One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"". So above is cancer biology jargon saying that i am not able to understand how this can be modulated in a single step. Now check example and evaluate any person or rather an untellectual on the basis thathow can he or she have command of Many subjects? when a person is not able to get a command on a single topic of his choice. Also refining your knowledge could leave you with very nice career options as well because you can never be a lecturer of Physics and Bilology simultaneously.","['I agree with the statement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than going for many.

I have specific reasons for my opinion. Which mainly support the idea of success and development. The first and most important reason is, that I strongly connect success with challenge. In order to have success I need to have a challenge. You can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate. He does this every day, without any change. Therefore he has no challenge, because he has done this several times and knows what to do. Without the challenge he can not show success and willn't be recognized by anyone. The second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful. Everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular, new or difficult. In order to do new and difficult things, I need to know my capabilities. These capabilities will need training. Hence if I do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities, I have less possibilities to choose from. Therefore I am limited in the things I can solve. In contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which lead to beingmore successful. The third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful. For example your boss will test you before he promotes you. He will give you things to do that are new to you. For that you will have to take risks to solve these problems. Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful.

We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. The second reason is that commissars are in need of helpers.

In high school and college they have a kind of rule -like homework- that a student has to help his or her community at list 10 hoursper year. We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. The second reason is that commissars are in need of helpers. They have a lot of things to do so they need many people."", 'Most communities do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
149,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that both of these options are very important for a student. Of course, it depends on what is your field of study. For this reason I would say that I disagree with this statement. For example if you are studyinghistory, it is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of course this is also a very important knowledge that is required ofyou, as a historian , to have. It is really very important, infact a student is studying for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what you are studying but I can't say that this is more important than learning facts, because without knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something. I'm thinking about when I was studying mathematics : for me and also because the teacher was very important that we, as students, understood the ideas and concepts behind an algebraic formulation, but of course you need to know very well also the formulation itself. An other reason why I disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text books, you can't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you don't remember the facts: I'm thinking at some friends of me that they study something and after a few hours you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink, except'm the main ideas. On the other hand, I think that is important in the future, I mean after 10 or more years after your studies, to remember the main ideas and concepts; and it is quite impossible to remember all the learned facts. At the same time, I don't want to say that I disagree with this statement but it depends a lot on which is your field of study and in which time protection you are looking for.","[""I think that both of these options are very important for a student.

165,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"At the beginning of the 19th century, the first advertisement appeared in public life. In fact,certain goods are meant to be described as much better than they really are. However, in my personal opinion, I believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the AD makers are over promoting their goods. First of all, human beings are animals that are full of desires. We want ourselves to be respected and popular among others, so we are usually willing to pay to help us achieve that goal. For example, most of us use shampoo to wash our hair everyday, and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner. Yet, is that true? Is there any scientific data ever proving that shampoo can clean up our hair? Look at the TV shows, magazines and the internet again, there are still a lot of six - year - old women who make themselves more charming by using certain brands of shampoos. As soon as we believe those advertisements, and are persuaded by them, we will go straight to spend money on buying their goods. And most of the time without even a reason. Also, if you pass by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge AD of a sports star wearing a pair of NIke sport shoes and looking so happy and cool, won't you start to have an idea of ""Wow, those shoes look so good""? Even so, is the truth that truning out as a pair of NIke shoes is the reason that we become cooler and happier? Easy enough, the answer is no. Actually, it is not the game of advertisements that makes most products seem better, but persuasion you by connecting different signals and messages into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them.","['At the beginning of the 19th century, the first advertisement appeared in public life. In fact,certain goods are meant to be described as much better than they really are. However, in my personal opinion, I believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the AD makers are over promoting their goods. First of all, human beings are animals that are full of desires. We want ourselves to be respected and popular among others, so we are usually willing to pay to help us achieve that goal. For example, most of us use shampoo to wash our hair everyday, and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner. Yet, is that true? Is there any scientific data ever proving that shampoo can clean up our hair? Look at the TV shows, magazines and the internet again, there are still a lot of six - year - old women who make themselves more charming by using certain brands of shampoos. As soon as we believe those advertisements, and are persuaded by them, we will go straight to spend money on buying their goods. And most of the time without even a reason. Also, if you pass by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge AD of a sports star wearing a pair of NIke sport shoes and looking so happy and cool, won\'t you start to have an idea of ""Wow, those shoes look so good""? Even so, is the truth that truning out as a pair of NIke shoes is the reason that we become cooler and happier? Easy enough, the answer is no.', 'Actually, it is not the game of advertisements that makes most products seem better, but persuasion you by connecting different signals and messages into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

167,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago.","[""I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

170,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want.","[""I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession. Another reason ,I believe that taking risks and trying new things brings success because it brings creativity in a person which leads to success in life. When we try new things in life then our brain works faster and we feel more challenging.","[""When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

182,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts. Therefore the amount of money is a very important aspect of human life. Everybody has different points of views about how they must earn the money. Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers.","['Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts.

183,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","These days, there are numerous problems which are related to cars, such as air pollution problems, traffic jams, or fuel problems. I strongly believe that these problems will be solved as the numbers of cars decrease in the next twenty years, with the changes in the government policy and developments of new technology. First, the government tries to make a policy to decrease the numbers of cars, as they face problems which are caused by cars. Governments encourage people to use public transportation rather than their own cars, and this will decrease the numbers of cars. For example, the Korean government already have a practical policy which makes people prefer public transportation. The government encourages people who use public transportation to take their taxes less. However, people who have their own cars should pay much more taxes, according to the new policy. As the new policy stated, many people try to use public transportation, and this decreases the number of private cars. Second, new technologies develop to substitute cars, such as monorails, private air crafts, and these equipments will be practical immediately. There have been many research efforts to create new transportation which is better than cars, and finally these days, these efforts are gaining their results. For example, many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in ordinary places, because air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars these days. About two years from now, they succeeded in the development, and according to some newspapers, it will be practical in ten years from then.","['These days, there are numerous problems which are related to cars, such as air pollution problems, traffic jams, or fuel problems.

184,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts. People these days seem to pay a lot of attention to ideas, but the fact is, this has made a lot of useless 'inventions'. Because  of this, I saw a new 'invention' the other day. It was a little fan that could be tied on the arm, which could be used for cooling off the hot noodles while people were picking up the noodles. The fan is not tiny, but even if it is, is there really a lot of consumers for this kind of product? I do not think so. If i were the customer, i wouldn't even bring a fan to a restaurant just to cool off the noodles. This is one example of people only getting the idea but not the fact. As a matter of fact, many of the concepts and ideas are theories, which just came from hypethosis. If every student does not pay attention to the facts that are in daily life, how will they be able to find out or even to do labs without a habit which is called ""to discover themselves""? Ideas and concepts seem to be very important, but if they are just there without facts, I do not think there will be anybody to be able to understand them. It is the twenty-first century, society and technology are updating everyday, if people only get the ideas and concepts in the text book instead of getting the facts, they will not be able to fit into this society very well, due to their lack of methods that will work the best and creativity.

190,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students are of different types and the way of preparing for their subject and the way they approach the subject are different when compared to each other.

Some students just blindly take the text books,and not only text books and they collect a lot of material and they just go blindly reading those facts that are in the books and material,so in this case the students wont get the practical knowledge of the subject and just blindly know what the subject is.

192,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do. If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first. People need to try new things. Furthermore,in schools. Teachers ask questions of their students. Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question. Even if the solution that the student did is wrong,this is the best way of learning the right thing for students. Especially in Mathematics classes. Even though I was not sure about the solution,I always wanted to try to solve it and I was always the volunteer. Last but not least,the way which goes to succeed is not always clear,there are often difficulties. For example,someone wants to study abroad,brings everything in his back and goes to the country where he will study. In this situation,he takes a risk of losing all his relationships with friends and even with his family. Moreover,he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country. If he needs help,then there is nobody at the first times when he goes to this country. On the other hand,at the end of these risks,he will return to his own country knowing new languages and being a graduate from a university,new opportunities etc. There is only one thing why he did so many things,just to be successful, to be an important man in his job. All in all,as i said before,for being successful,taking risks is the most important thing. Both,if someone takes risks then at the and of that,it is surely that he will be able to manage this,and if someone gets successful for the first time, it is not about being successful. My motto is,experience is the mother of wisdom.","['Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life.

194,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers.

Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers.

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it.

A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts. Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying. while a person can teach something if he does nt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough.","['From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life.

210,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, we are living in an individualism world. In our parents' period, it was really different, everyone helped everybody. Today this period is revolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon. First, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60's or 70's. Young people always pretext they don't have time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old,we, young people, always have the feeling that we are too busy. We have personal work, group projects, sports etc but in our planning, there is no time for anything else. Well, I say that but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we would prefer going 3 weeks on holiday rather than staying one week to help a charitable cause. There should be another reason why young people are careless. Secondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individual and egoist society. Everyone thinks about him or herself. Young people believe less in God than before, that could also be a good reason. There are not a lot of religious events. But religion is an efficient way to get people around a good cause in order to help other communities. And all of it is just the consequence of the environment of a society or a lack of values, education.","[""Nowadays, we are living in an individualism world. In our parents' period, it was really different, everyone helped everybody. Today this period is revolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon. First, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60's or 70's. Young people always pretext they don't have time to help anybody.

211,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly believe the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Understanding the idea is more important for every student in the class room. the understanding of the ideas and concepts gives the overall picture of that particular lecture. for example in my college days i concentrated more on my lessons ,at that time i knew the central idea of the topic. This type of skills will improve the ability to study and the ability to remember. These skills also reduce the study time. the students can learn more in a format quickly.

212,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts since it offers lots of advantages to students. Among the divers reasons I support this opinion, there are two reasons. First, through understanding ideas, students may become more logical than before. For example, when I was a high school student, I would attend the experiment in science class in the laboratory. it makes me solve the teacher's prompt which makes me get a complicated theory inscience. In addition , the course in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomena such as global warming , soil erosion, and so on which make me a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, I agree that students must focus on understanding rather than learning facts since they would be logical. secondly, as students under standing ideas, they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which make all around the world thrive more than before. For example, when I was a middle school student, I would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness. Back then ,particularly, my geography teacher had a special characteristic which explained to understanding ideas until a number of students perfectly grasped the contents of geography. As a result, I could be a specialist in geography and at the same time I had a major in geography atuniversity. Therefore, I prefer to understand ideas to concepts.","[""I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts since it offers lots of advantages to students.

213,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There is a proverb ; Knowledge is power. It means more knowledge brings more power. I strongly agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better. There are some reasons why having broad knowledge of academic subjects is better because of application in other fields and various experiences. First of all, by having different kinds of academic subjects, we can apply to other different fields. For example, if a construction company has a plan to build a new modern style building in a city. In this case, the first thing we can think about is that a company must need an architect, who builds buildings. If architecture has broad knowledge of other academic subjects , then it would be better for making buildings. He can use various subjects such as art, math and geology in order to build a building. In addition,modern society needs people who are able to do multitasking jobs. Moreover, having various academic subjects can make people have different experiences. For instance, I majored in business at school.","['There is a proverb ; Knowledge is power. It means more knowledge brings more power.

216,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Any other expression would not be more important than this topic. Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same. I believe, traffic is not just a waste of time; in addition, it is a waste of energy. For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour. It means that everyday I spend 1 hour on theroads.","['Any other expression would not be more important than this topic.

226,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts.

227,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life.","[""Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death.

Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example.

There will be a car which flies in the sky, or intermediate moving vehicles from one place to another in one second. This new technology makes people not use a car because it will require less energy to operate and it will be more convenient, and faster than today's car. Secondly, People use public transport rather than their own cars. every year, the number of people who use public transport such as buses, trains and subway is increasing. According to the statistics, the reason why they take public transport is it takes less money, less time and is convenient.

Also, there are terrible traffic jams every morning. This is a reason why people use public transport rather than their own car. This will make fewer cars than today in the future.

Therefore,living in a confined country,with an increasing population doesn't allow for a sanitary and better life. So,to avoid this problem,we should decrease the number of cars by simply applying a few rules. First of all,we should make a law that forbids people to drive by themselves. What i mean is that cars should be considered for a minimum of four people. If that doesn't happen the owner of the car shouldn't be allowed to drive,penalty a ticketor worse. Then the community should make available more community rides like buses or any other vehicle that holds more people than a car.

261,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics. Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. One of the reasons for students to clearly understand ideas and concepts is motivation. If students understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the importance of eating healthily. Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works.","[""Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics.

262,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is collected around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority will have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak. Also if knowledge was limited to only one subject, scientistsn't wouldn't have success the success which they have today. For example, if Nuoten hadn't bothered to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, i don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all. he could have spent his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason for gravity.","[""Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion.

271,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is very important for students, and also for other people to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learn facts without knowing what they are. There are three main reasons why it is important. They can remember ideas easily and also last longer, able to get interested in subjects, and increase their self confidence. Firstly, by understanding some ideas, it is much easier to memories and it also lasts longer than just learning without any understanding. Especially for students, they have to prepare for a unit test or provincial exam which is after the whole semester. They need to know the facts properly and remember them in the right way. To give an example of this, during students' studies, they will find unconvinced time if they do not understand the facts that they learned. But if they understand everything, they are able to remember longer and have confidence to prepare for the test. Secondly, if a person understands an idea, it is possible to get interested in it. Because it is the only hard time before he/she understands. After they know what it is, then it becomes a very interesting idea which can get the person very interested in it. For example, if a student does not understand how to multiply, a teacher will teach the student. After the person knows how to do it, math can become a very interesting subject. Lastly, self confidence is really important forstudents. By understanding ideas and concepts about some subjects, they enjoy the time to study which makes them know more and more. This makes the students increase their self confidence. For instance, if a student does not know anything about history, but finally he/she understands, the person thinks of himself as a very smart person, so the student can teach or tutor other friends who do not know about history. To finish with, understanding ideas and concepts, especially about subjects the students learn from school takes very important jobs for students. They are able to remember longer than not knowing and just study, they have chances to get interested in some subjects, and it also increases self confidencestrongly.","[""It is very important for students, and also for other people to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learn facts without knowing what they are.

275,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they haven't had too many sad experiences yet. I think that it is ironic since most people want to live longer. But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger. First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease.

Children don't want to become adults because they are reluctant to have too many responsibilities.

I think that it is ironic since most people want to live longer. But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger. First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease.

276,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","This is a very diplomatic statement to say that the use of cars will decrease in the future. As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them. In this fast growing society, cars do play a major significant role, as they do be very helpful for quicker transportation, because time once lost cannot be regained, and for the world twenty years from now, time will play a very prominent role. There are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars, which would become a major resource for growing the usage of cars in the future. By using this type of car, they have many advantages like the faster mode of transportation, which not only improves one's only status but improves the whole economic development of the country. Because to compete with the development of the countries the citizens should be using their time to the fullest. and the other one is a pollution free environment, which is very important now due to global warming coming as a major consequence innature. In addition its really very hard for any citizen to wait for government mass transportation , who is in an emergency, or planning to go for a picnic with his family members or so and would be more suitable to have his own car than rely on any others. The only thought which brings us to the conclusion that in the next twenty years the number of cars will be decreased is the problems of pollution, traffic congestion, or the scarcity of petrolium products, but there are many alternatives which have been taken as substitutes to these problems. and the usage of modern improvisation in this aspect would capture the imagination of the nation for the alternative use. and these have been proved through analysis of the last 2-3 years in most of the parts of the world.","[""This is a very diplomatic statement to say that the use of cars will decrease in the future.

277,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination. of course every idea can be based onfacts. but sometimes it's wrong because students have to try to think of things someyears ago. many schools force students to study with formulas and memorize only facts. they didn't allow students to speak their opinions freely. but these days, many systems have changed in school. they encourage students' creative activity. when childhood is important to students they don't know much about society and the future and around many things.

Almost all modern schools teach many subjects to the students, such as Maths, science and history. However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits.

Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in.

By learning the facts we can prevent wars like the second world war and the first world war. by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods, It was very interesting. last week some of the people found the Dwaraka under the sea, so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were Dwaraka in the past. By understanding the concepts and ideas we can Improve the knowledge of the subject and we can Improve our performance and profound knowledge in the subject. we can't understand concepts like polymorphism and abstraction while learning about the facts. All the students can understand by understanding the concepts and ideas of the subject. Concepts were very Important and Ideas were also Important.

290,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is collected around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority will have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak. Also if knowledge was limited to only one subject, scientistsn't wouldn't have success the success which they have today. For example, if Nuoten hadn't bothered to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, i don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all.","[""Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion.

Doing what you already know to do will not take you anywhere if it is what most people do. Many of the best inventions in the world were the outcome of risks taken by ordinary people, just like you and me. We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects.

There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some people think that they are only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. Through these experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his internship. He worked as a worker in a building. During his internship, he experienced and learnt how he could build a strong building. Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well. Good productions bring success.

329,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons. Firstly, if a person is focused on a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge, because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field. Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people to know many things from a superficial view; it is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field. I can concide that broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff. But that is not usually the common case because most people work in medium or large companies. Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself. Usually general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be inserted.","['Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons.

340,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students have a number of ways to learn nowadays. Personally, it is much better when I study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea. I believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than facts is the best way to succeed. Learning facts is very hard to keep because you could forget them over time, Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments, And finally students' skills can be enhanced. It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the battle started, what the conditions were after the battle finished, and so on. It could be in your brain longer than learning facts. Understanding concepts could be valuable when you are studying a different topic. For example, the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict. On the other hand, if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even, maybe you have to study again for your business or your geography class. Students could develop better skills if they learn concepts and ideas. They could argue for example, why the battle happened, or even learn that war conflict is not the best way to thrive. They could even be interested in and pursue a carer in history. I think learning concepts and ideas from a topic, gives you many opportunities for your future life. For all these reasons, I support the statement that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts. It improves their skills, helps them to other subjects and enhances their skills.","[""Students have a number of ways to learn nowadays. Personally, it is much better when I study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea. I believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than facts is the best way to succeed. Learning facts is very hard to keep because you could forget them over time, Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments, And finally students' skills can be enhanced. It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the battle started, what the conditions were after the battle finished, and so on.

341,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Risks in life There is a diversity of people, and they all have different ways to see and to take life. We have the ones that are ""laisy"", that prefer to stay with their own knowledge and continue life as a constant person. But on the other hand we have the ""active"" person, the ones that are comfortable with having new experiences. I think people have to be positive in life and while we are exposed to new experiences we need to integrate and to deal with them taking risks and caring about ourfuture. One of the reasons I agree with the risky people, is because I am like that. I am the person that never gives up during my new experience, maybe I use my experience from the past to help myself guide and find a solution. These kinds of people have a lot to bring to the world because they are constantly creating new things and new ways of seeing things. Another reason for my agreement with the first statement, is because I imagine the future in the hands of people in front of life this way and it produces me something disgusting.

343,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ideas and concepts came from the facts. I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims. According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense. I usually convert the idea to fact by looking on the internet for facts about things that are related to the idea. In comparison, students are different some of them like to learn things but others like to understandideas. We learn from facts that are sure. and we learn from our mistakes. But the idea should be understoo.","[""The ideas and concepts came from the facts.

345,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. First, we always choose the same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to the supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys the same snack. One day, I asked him, "" Why do you choose the same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watch this snack's commercial on television, then I think that this snack tastes good, so I always choose this one. ""I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he is influenced by television commercials , so he always chooses the same snack. Second, we always believe in the content of commercials. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food. My father asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy expensive natural food? ""My sister answered,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food. ""However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there was a lot of value in her natural food, but it was the same as normal food. She was influenced by the advertisement that included her book. Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercials, radio commercials, magazines, books, newspapers, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show the correct information. The meaning of an advertisement is to sell a lot of goods, so when we buy any good, we should research a lot of information, and we should ask for opinions from family or friends.

347,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yeh , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, because it will help them to have a grip on the concept. Studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student, the student's knowledge develops only when he thinks about the topic. How did he/she get that thinking? once if they are having some grasp or idea on the topic. The student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity. I am agreeing with the concept because I have had practical experience once up on a time. Two students in my class attended an exam full of practice. I am explaining the practice module of both of the students, one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day without any breakage and also without any idea. And the other person who is also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept. After they arrived after the exam one of the people who prepared the whole night without any breakage told me that the question papper is very hard and I didnt understand the concept of the papper. But the other person told me that the question paper is very easy to answer ,I answered in 1 hour out of 2hours. That much is easy the exam is. he told me like that I could nt get first why they were telling me like that , when asked both of them how they studied I got the answer to my question. On that day itself I understood that instead of memorising the words we will go for understanding which will be very helpful to the person to develop in any way. FInally I conclude in such a way that people must understand the concept or idea, instead of studying it first we have to study and we have to understand , without that we can't achieve any thing.","[""Yeh , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, because it will help them to have a grip on the concept.

348,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparison to the risk resident people face. However, every human being has to know for himself or herself which goals and objectives he or she wants to achieve and how fast to get there. In addition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success.","['The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts.

From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is because he does not know about the realities. If he had already learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into a puzzle. In addition, students always get more interest in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts. Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt to society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already knew the facts. Besides, students can also use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas.","['In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society.

351,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. There are many reasons which support the first idea. Firstly, motivation is a very important factor in the academic knowledge process. When a person is interested in one subject he can protect his or her motivation for academic study. Secondly, keeping an order, combining the information about the subject makes a person expert and helps him or her to use and outsource. Thirdly, coordinated and specialized information is always helpful for a person. It also brings happiness and welfare to an individual's life. Another important reason is creating new theories or inventing new things. orders and specialized knowledge can easily produce new ways, theories, inventions etc by the help of its scientific history and experience. On the other hand, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has many disadvantages for an individual like disordered knowledge, unhappiness, endless force for the aim etc. Picking up some things from every subject may make a person feel learned or satisfied but not intellectual. Every cookie and disorderd thing in mind causes stress because a mind never achieves to coordinate them. Intellectual satifying is a influential poison for people who choose the short way to information. Another thing which is the harmful result of the second idea is losing the way of academic life instead of being creating man for science.","[""Specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

I believe most of these advertisements make products seem better because they only talk about good things about their products and they also use attractive things, such as people, to fascinate people. Since advertisements only show the benefits of that product, it seems very attractive to people. For example, my mother wanted to have a new vaccum. When she was watching the TV show, there was a commercial about a new vaccine. It said "" this is really powerful and useful! You should buy one! !""or that sort of thing. My mother was fascinated by that and next day, she went to the store and bought one. When she used it, she was really shocked. Although it was really powerful, it made a really loud noise and exhaled a lot of air. She was really mad that the advertisement did not say anything about the noise. Also since advertisements are to attract people, they try to make those nicer, which results in making products seem much better than they really are. For example, there was a new kind of CD player when I was 12 years old.","['These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments.

383,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities. However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry for her and regretted focusing on just the quantity of the feasible time. In addition, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never shows one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is an example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyers in Korea. He is renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedication to society. It is evident that he has limited time to do multiple things at the same time. In order to overcome these problems, he has devoted himself to the community in various ways which don't need to take a long time. He provided huge amounts of money for poor people and no one blames him although he doesn't spend enough time. In brief, I strongly support that young people still do their best for the world. They have their own ways to help others and we never evaluate their trying.","[""Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities.

When you have everything you need, you can not imagine that you could help people who would love to have your help. I agree that nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their colleagues. But this is not true only for young people. Nowadays, in our society, everyone thinks about him before someone else. It's called 'selfish'. And i definitely can not agree with this because even if we have the chance to leave in a rough country, poverty exists. Young people and also adults have to pay attention to their community. But if we want young people to help, adults have to show an example. We must have a lot of people who help each other because it is so much easier to live this way. First, when you help someone, you bring him so much happiness that he will feel much better quickly, and you give yourself a good satisfaction by doing it. But the man, or woman you did help will do it for someone else. And this other person for another, and so on. By the way, if you think about this, by helping each other, this is all society who will feel better,and if there are more people doing this, after a while, fewer people will need help. I know it's not possible to solve everyone's problem, but it's a dream that can come true. There are 6 billion people on Earth, so is it better to have 6 billion people who don't care except themselves, or is it better to have 6 billion people who are crew.","[""Nowadays, most young people don't know what misery is.

387,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago. The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need. I was kind of addicted to television home shipping a few years ago, the seller in the homeshopping mentioned what kind of people need their product. He said, younger or older ladies and gentlemen.

When young people think ""I will be old sometime"" they often think of ""but not yet and I have enough time to enjoy my life! "". Then young people often do something forbidden or something ""freaky"". For example I read about parcour. Parcour means that you run across a city and always run straight on even if there are cars, garages and houses. You just climb up the wall and then jump down and that is what many young people do. For older people enjoying life is often spending time withfamily, going travelling and reading something in which they are interested. For example can everybody remember his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would never have allowed or something like that? And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels? Older people mostly just enjoy their life. But young people are often not allowed to do the things they want to do and often the parents are the reason for that.

Better physical conditions are good references to make young people enjoy life. Most young young people know that they have a better physical condition than the olders. A young person generally knows that he or she has an undeformed body related to most of the olders and finds himself or herself strong enough to perform a different job.

Before starting a hard job I know I can deal with that job as long as I want. If I face difficulties, I can spare bigger time for my job. Nowadays, it is true that knowing less information about life, people are better motivated to their lives. It is important for people what they have learned during their lifetime, but when a person realizes the things he or she has faced, he or she doesn't want to remember them.","['Whether young or old, many people have expectations of life.

In order to explain this topic, we can show that this is a controversial point, depending on which condition you look at this situation. First of all, it's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing very quickly, and there are more and more cars on the road. This certainly leads to the increasing of the price of the train and the price of tickets in this last ten years. But, you can tell, that in the industry are trying to change this problem, not by trying to reduce the car industry, but by trying to find a new way not to pollutethe planet, like by biocarburant. Furthermore, It's nearly impossible to avoid people using their car, like for working people, or people living far away. And in addition, today, having a car, is also to be part of the social world, to be autonomous. However, You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear. When you see the fast evolution of all the other ways to be driven. Furthermore, lots of people prefer public transport as a cheaper way to go to work, and governments understand this and are developing this, like in hong kong, where you can do everything without anycar, or in London, where the city doesn't allowany car. Or even in strasbourg where the french government make cheaper tickets in order to encourage people to let their car at home. In addition, we can not plan clearly in which way the world will evolve. If you take as an example a developed country, because it's the one who will be more affected by this matter, you can already tell how they already try to develop other ways to move in and outside of their country. Take as an example, the train development and the decrease in the price in some companies helped by government. In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of cars on the road in twenty years, in my opinion, I can say I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road, this due to the evolution of the population. But with the news technologies, the bad effects of this on the environment and as a bigger scale on the planet, can be reduced, which is a good point, and as a matter of fact that the petrol resources in the world became really rare, which can be a real turn in the car industry, I hope in a good way.","[""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Everyone has a community to live in ,but do not give it enough time to help. What is your community like? Your community is representing you. If you do not give your community a time to help you, you do not even help yourself. You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community, your community will develop so you will develop and you will think better to have a very good and connected community. Why do young people not give their community enough time to help. I think that they do not think of this or this thing or even do not come to their mind.

For example if you are studyinghistory, it is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages, than you have to understand ideas and concepts, but of course this is also a very important knowledge that is required ofyou, as a historian , to have. It is really very important, infact a student is studying for this reason, to understand ideas and concepts of what you are studying but I can't say that this is more important than learning facts, because without knowledge of the facts you can't say that you have studied something.

However it did not matter how many times I had solved his problems. It just made him create more.

As time goes by, we grow up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society, which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people.

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world.","['Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen.

A person who is able to do this would be much more successful in her/his job, just because of being able to make the way of working more effective. In school this kind of understanding and finding solutions to problems should be taught. Another reason why a theme should be understood is because of fun. Fun motivates us to go on, to do more. For some people it might be perfect to learn by heart, but most of them get bored.

426,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Many people complain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion this is true because this is the way companies use to incite people to buy their product, and this is how people can only find out about new products. First of all, when a company makes an advertisement for its product, it wants to make sure that the product looks perfect on the eyes of the consumer. For example, if the company makes different types of products,it will make the advertisement of the perfect one. Companies can't show their weakness for their own products because there will be no one who will buy them. Second, advertising is the only way that people will know about a new product. For example, when the company wants to send a new product onto the market ,it uses advertising. Apparently the company wants to incite people to buy its product that is why it will make it unbelievable in the advertisement in order to make people think that this product is so good. From this you can understand that most of the time the presentation of many products in advertisements is really different from how they really are. The companies are so clever when they make these advertisements because they want to incite people.","[""Many people complain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

Today the situation is not good for the big presence of cars and science and gadgets must do something to solve this problem and to limit the damage that these cars' presence does to the environment.

436,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Here are my reasons. First, the time of young people is not always enough. As a result of wealth, almost every student can study in schools, so they all have an opportunity to make friends with peers in schools. Hence, in their leisure time, they always have dates with their friends. In addition, the competition among young people is great, All students have to not only go to school but also go to cram schools to prepare for exams. Therefore, it is almost possible for them to have time to help other people. Second, all people, not only young people, all become colder and colder. For instance, I have seen a young man just sit on his seat near a standing pregnant woman without helping her. If we don't help a person who is just surrounding us, how can we help our communities possibly? In addition, our education always teaches us to study hard to get a famous college and compete with others. Therefore, we are not friendly with others because everyone is possible to be our enemy. So, we become never kind to others from our hearts. Third, we are always unfamiliar with our neighbours. Because everyone is busy searching for his wealthy life, he has to work hard to get high salaries or study hard to prepare to find a good job. We never have time to drink a cup of coffee with our neighbors. In addition, we all live in flats, so it is very hard for us to meet the people in the community.

Maybe learning facts is important for students. But I think if they understand ideas and concepts, they will get facts, too. I think understanding ideas and concepts is easier to understand, instead of just learning facts. When I study biology, and history in English, my tutor always gives me examples, and ideas. And it is always helpful to me, and I will never forget about it. For foreign language students, the ideas and examples are helpful. Because they could not understand English well as Americans do, they could not just learn facts from books. So, the ideas or concepts are very important to them to learn facts.

Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you only do what you already know at your times, you may fall behind the times. So its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages. the most valuable benefit of my opinion is that trying new things and taking risks may lead you to get more experience in the changing world, you may never lose any information. And that is what the first opinion would never achieve. What's more the advantages of my opinion are bigger than its disadvantages. So many people would think there are too many risks when trying new things and it may lead you to lose more.

Of course; young people enjoy life more than older people for several reasons. First; I can say that young people have more free time than old people. Therefore ; this means that they have more time to spend on their hobbies and favorite sports. They have a chance to do whatever they want whenever they want to, such as leisure activities. For example; young people dont have to take care of children , clean the home and cook for dinner. However; older people have to spend some time on all of these things. Second; having a joyful time in life is more related to age. Young people have more energy than older people. They are more energetic and physically active as compared to older people. This enables young people to get more enjoyment from life. They can go to mountains for climbing , go for skiing and go for diving. However; older people may not do all these activities since they may not be able to find enough energy to do them. Therefore; this makes them not get much joy from life. Finally ; it is more related to the psychology of people. Since young people have much more curiosity than older people ; they have an eagerness to discover new things. Young people try to get as much info as they can get from their environment. Therefore; they have much more tendency to enjoy life most. In contrast; older people would not be in a mood to look for something new. Since they get a lot of experience from life, they may never find enough interest to already discovered issues.

I think that young people can enjoy life more than older people because young people have a lot of time to do everything. Also I think that because young people enjoy life doing the things that they like, such as, skating, snowboarding and surfing. Also I think that young people enjoy life because they always do the things that old peoplen't don't want to do. Moreover, young people have a lot of energy to do everything, one thing that old people don't have because they felt tired of that. However, I think that one kind of old people can enjoy life more than younger people, that is the old people that have a lot of money and are a little bit crazy.

Once, i asked him about his way of teaching and i gave him my opinion about explaining the ideas to understand them. He thanked me and changed his teaching methods. I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts. My reasons are listed below. First of all, understanding ideas helps students to expand their knowledge. If the student gets only the facts without understanding, he will forget this fact fast with any useful. A human has a brain to think and understand facts not just to learn them. Moreover, we must give the student a chance to reach the creative level. Using the brain and understanding ideas, the student is eager to create something new.

Life is not about age whether it is a young person or an older person, but instead about the symbolism of joy is a way of enlightening and bringing happiness. Younger people might think or have the idea that they are the only ones to enjoy life, but at what cost. Older people have the treasure of wisdom among knowledge, with a conviction of lots of experience, they have the mature and most important quality, patience. I have seen older people enjoying life more then younger people, but also, comes to a cost of good health. I have seen many older people that enjoy life as if they have the hearth of a twenty year old person.

454,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Well i think it ` s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first question is, what are old people, and what are young people? It mainly depends on the person. Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and elderly people are about 60 years old. In this case, young people have other interests than elderly people have. For example, young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music, whereas elderly people are enjoying a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the background. But i have to mention, that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music. For example the generation who grows up with Rolling Stones or AC DC still go to their concerts. The only difference is, that young people are normally in better shape than elderly people are. The older you are the more problems you are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can do more sports. Elderly people have to care more about themselves.","['Well i think it ` s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

455,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work. are shown. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you would rather pay attention to the person or musician announcing the item than the announced item itself. Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportsmen or sportwomen are used in the ads. To sum up, I do not believe what is shown in the ads. since they make the products more attractive than they really are.

Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well. Good productions bring success. For these people should know how to do and improve it. In this way, they do not need to take risks or experience new things, because they can maintain this from books.","[""TAKING RISKS Most people are afraid to take risks in their lives.

Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting.

464,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth. It's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products. But sometimes,the products really disappoint clients. For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it. But only after some days,I found the shoes hadn't got a good texture and were destroyed by walking. Then from these advertisements,I take a lesson:Don't believe adversisements! When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive,it means in other aspects,maybe they are controversial. When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not. Watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of the world. And some advertisements are too artistic or dramatic, which attract people very much. Like microsoft's advertisements for pentium 4. They tell us a new generation of computers,Though high- technology such as computers,mobile phones, mp 3s are improving very quickly. But they are the fashion. And for me,I think high-technology and make-up things are toys. They are changeable like the toys I played with during my childhood. And they can be discussion topics. It makes us more interesting. Though their prices are not reasonable. Afterwards,though the advertisements always give us products not as good as they claim. But as daily information,we can't get away from them. In a global world today,we also get benefits from advertisements.","[""I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth. It's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products. But sometimes,the products really disappoint clients. For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it. But only after some days,I found the shoes hadn't got a good texture and were destroyed by walking. Then from these advertisements,I take a lesson:Don't believe adversisements! When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive,it means in other aspects,maybe they are controversial. When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not. Watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of the world. And some advertisements are too artistic or dramatic, which attract people very much. Like microsoft's advertisements for pentium 4. They tell us a new generation of computers,Though high- technology such as computers,mobile phones, mp 3s are improving very quickly. But they are the fashion. And for me,I think high-technology and make-up things are toys. They are changeable like the toys I played with during my childhood. And they can be discussion topics. It makes us more interesting. Though their prices are not reasonable. Afterwards,though the advertisements always give us products not as good as they claim. But as daily information,we can't get away from them."", 'In a global world today,we also get benefits from advertisements.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way.

Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in.

492,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are. Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it. The thing for people to decide whether to buy or not is usually outside looking. So people will complain about the products when they buy them.","[""Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products.

I ask them if they need anything when I am going to the market or for example. If something is going on in front of my eyes i do not close my eyes, i interfere and help. If I am not aware of what can i do about it? I think this sentence is both true and not true from different views. It is true that young people might be a little bit isolated from the community and because of this they are not helping much. but young  people, especially students are busy with studying and developing themselves and should not be worried about not giving enough time."", 'it is a communitarian responsibility to create the occasions for sharing and helping.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
498,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago. To improve its condition, I attend this activity.","[""I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together.

They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life.

504,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes. Most people usually plan to travel across the country or overseas in their own life. They enjoy talking about diverse experiences where each person traveled. From my experience, I agree with the travel in a group led by a tour guide for some economical and exciting reasons. Firstly, I like to travel in groups led by a tour guide because I can save more money and time. A tour guide is professional enough to give us more information suited to the places that we want to travel to. In addition, a tour guide needs to compete with other agencies, and it tries to give more benefits to its clients. A tour guide also has a lot of experienced information about what I want to travel, so it is kind to consult her to give information. The more important reason for agreeing is that we enjoy much more than traveling with several people for themselves. We can have a chance to socialise with a lot of new people. If we travel around unfamiliar places alone, it is difficult to first talk about unfamiliar people. So it can be alone. However, traveling in groups first is easy to talk about each other.","['Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes.

First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan anything because the tour guide knows everything about what to do or where to go. It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group.

507,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, people however their age, are selfish because of the values conveyed by modern society and capitalistvalues. Indeed, everybody thinks about themselves so young people have grown up in this atmosphere of ''me and myself''.

In addition, globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identificationproblem: which communities are for which people? Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fights between them. So, there is no unity in this world why would young people change this by helping who and with which means? Modern life makes young people very narcissistic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be useful. Some will help the oldest and disabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them. Others will come into an association to create a better life place for their community. Indeed some associations and organisations have social aims in which young people want to be involved. In my case, I really want to represent the Black in France because there is a lack of representation even in the media, fashion, intellectual and scientist work. So I went to the Boucle d' Ebenene association which promotes African and Caribean entrepreneurs even though I have my studies and different things to manage before to help them. To conclude, I agree with the fact that there is a lack of motivation among young people to involve themselves in social and civic activities to help their communities.

514,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price. To conclude, because of inaccurate estimations and damaging by the price of products, we seem to buy products which are actually not as good as they expected.","[""I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price."", 'To conclude, because of inaccurate estimations and damaging by the price of products, we seem to buy products which are actually not as good as they expected.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
515,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"This is not completely true. Indeed, I think that success is achievable in both ways. Some people build emperors doing the same thing all life long, quite as a south-italian farmer emigrated to Canada after World War II. In Italy he was a well known mozzarella producer, and once he established himself in Canada he began the same activity, with the same method, day after day, and now he is one of the richest men in the country, exporting his famous mozzarella throughout North America. Maybe nowadays in such a competitive market this kind of experience has become rare, because of globalization involving all the 5 continents that causes the rise of new competitors everywhere and because of the growth of multinational companies with uncountable capital. What is interesting is that in this statement' is that in our own life, fossilizing ourselves is a practice to avoy. A new idea, a different vision of life, the market, and so on, can cause a sudden success in our work place, family, group of friends or even in our school, and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position in this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study, to find a job, to be competitive in a single word.","[""This is not completely true.

516,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Personally i completely agree with this statement. Not only do I think this statement is true, but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act. I'm sure that one of the most important guidelines to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful, first of all you have to spend a lot of it! All successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evolving their companies and buying or creating new ones. I also think that one of the most important things for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power! It really doesn't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached. keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives. I can pick up a very well known example of a person who has been really successful: Silvio Berlusconi. The intention is not to discuss his political ideas, but to examine the goals a person has reached. A man who has always lived following this principle. At the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developing new companies. Some of these are always in the field of media, but some are not, like the italian football team AC Milan which he bought 20 years ago. Another example can be seen in the american Bill Gates. Can you imagine if he had stopped creating and inventing computer software after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway. Probably we would be less evoluted now.","['Personally i completely agree with this statement.

530,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand the ideas and concepts. There are two reasons why I believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. First, if students don't know about the facts perfectly and only understand about its circumstances and ideas, they will not know what the truth is. This would make students confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood the concepts of. They could do well according to what they have understood about, but if it is wrong what they have understood, they will fail at the moment. The second reason why i believe learning facts is more important is the change of concepts and ideas about what they learned. The concepts and ideas about an objective could change as time goes on.

There are two reasons why I believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. First, if students don't know about the facts perfectly and only understand about its circumstances and ideas, they will not know what the truth is. This would make students confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood the concepts of. They could do well according to what they have understood about, but if it is wrong what they have understood, they will fail at the moment. The second reason why i believe learning facts is more important is the change of concepts and ideas about what they learned. The concepts and ideas about an objective could change as time goes on. In other words, even though they learned the right concepts and ideas when they were students, the concepts of an object can keep changing depending on the social environment, so what they know will not come true anymore.

Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study. They are not afraid of troublesome things they feel that they can manage the whole world. They have not always been accepted in society for being problematic and for driving crazy at their parents. They are noisy people. In the end for adults used to be totallydifferent. They get enjoyment by other ways. Spend time with the family, go on a quiet vacation, read a good book, go to an orchestral concert, work at home, do the house work, are some of the activities which adults prefer to enjoy themselves.

532,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts? By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information. Huge topics and their contents can be covered in a minimum of time. But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned it. If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they really know it and will not forget it as quickly as they would if they just learnt it without understanding. So both sides have their positive and negative arguments. The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand. Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not really understand or would you be better off with some information you can handle and understand? Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just too huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it. So one should not concentrate on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) and one should not just learn facts. You would not know what to do with them. It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs that you have not learned, you are helpless.","['Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts?

Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil.

546,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics. Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. One of the reasons for students to clearly understand ideas and concepts is motivation. If students understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the importance of eating healthily. Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me an example of how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system. At that time I was able to learn how the heart works. Finally understanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity.","[""Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics.

Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me an example of how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system. At that time I was able to learn how the heart works."", 'Finally understanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
547,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The knowledge can be defined as the possibilities of everyone to speak on the biggest variety of subjects as possible. So it depends on the childhood, the luck to go to school and more generally of your life. For a student it is a good and a current question to know if he must choose early a speciality or keep during a long time many different lectures, What is the better choice ? It is not certain that the best choice exists. Nevertheless to my mind the recent evolution permits me to think that broad knowledge is preferred. The first example which accredits the thesis of broad knowledge is better is a farmer lost in a desert area with his cows he must primary know how to take care ofthem. It is easy to believe that he does not need to have broad knowledge in another speciality, but it is a restricted view. In fact if he wants his business to stay prosperous he needs to know how to read and write, it permits buying and sailing some cows or otheranimals. It is a simple example but there is another more technical  one. In the future the degree of expertise will increase so much.","['The knowledge can be defined as the possibilities of everyone to speak on the biggest variety of subjects as possible.

548,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"A person is successful because the person has different skills than the average person has. I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Successful people are open minded ,and they experience new things to improve their skills. First of all, successful people have wide horizons, and They have no limits. They try all types of new things so these new things make people achieve success in their life. For instance, Bill Gates is a successful person. He had broad horizons, and created microsoft. He had an idea to create an app in order to improve people's lives. His work in technology made people gain some extra time in their work. Secondly, people who like to experiment with new things achieve success in life. Successful people should have new ideas, and these new ideas lead people to experiment. Experimenting with a new thing lets other things come out.","[""A person is successful because the person has different skills than the average person has.

549,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. In my opinion, if you understand the concept, you always have time to learn facts or dates. In children's education, for example, it's important to give them instruments to understand nature and society. I think it's not so important to fill them with dates and facts. Moreover, if a child understands a concept, he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life. If he learns a fact without understanding it, he will forget it in a month. For example, i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old, just because my teacher explained the meaning of them. I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explanation of them. If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it, the children have no sense and don't pay attention to it. The same is true in adult education. In the university of medicine, for example, it is much more important to understand how to visit a patient, than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body. You always have time to take a book and learn it.","[""I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

550,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,According to me people only become successful when they try new things and take more risks. If a person continues to do the same thing that he is well known for then there are fewer chances that he can earn more profits than he is earning now. People like Bill gates or Ambani took risks and came to the position where they are now. I will take the example of my friend's father who used to sell toys on cycle. He used to get up early in the morning and come back late at night. One day he was offered a chance or you could say it was a risk. The risk was to invest some amount of money in a business. If the business works then he will become rich but if it does not then he will lose what ever money he has and become very poor. He took this risk and worked very hard for the business to earn profits. He started with a small amount of profits then he invested that profit again in the business and kept expanding his business. Today he is one of the richest people in our society. So now we atleast know one thing that without risk there are very few chances of becoming successful. My father is also very rich and has his own business but when i grow up i do not want to continue my father's business because i want to have a platform. Im getting help from him which i do not want.,"[""According to me people only become successful when they try new things and take more risks.

551,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First,it is very dangerous if one travels alone. When we travel to a new place,we do not know a lot about it. We will have plenty of problems. For example ,we may get lost in the new place;we may not find the right place to have meals and sleep after the whole tiring day. The first day of our trip will be full of finding ,boring and tired. Also,because if we travelled in a group,we could make a lot of new friends. I like to be with other people. It will not make me feel frightened and alone. When one of us is in trouble during the trip,the others will help him,we stay together like a big family. Sometimes after an interesting trip,someone could find his true love. Finally, our travel will become more interesting if we travel in a group led by a tour guide. The tour guide knows a lot of facts about the place which we are travelling to. He will tell us the history of the great interest when we see it. On the last National Day, I had a short holiday in HangZhou, I traveled alone without a tour guide. I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had been marked on it. But I failed ,I almost could not find any of them. I have got lost on the street at last.

557,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly.","['The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts.

558,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life. Nowadays, schools are almost every where in the world, where people would try to get as much education as possible, so they can be the top person. Almost all modern schools teach many subjects to the students, such as Maths, science and history. However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better. Not only is information going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future. In order to get into a good company or create a good company. People do not need all the subjects to do this. The only thing is the strength you have over the others. For example, a good program writer's nesscery skill is to write programs. He/she does not need to know Zoology well to do so, so why should he/she bother studying it if society only needs one strong strength per person. Strong strength is what a good company is searching for. Furthermore, specializing in a subject for a student can also benefit society and the world. Inventions make the lives better for people, such as the internet search engine and medicine prolong lives. People should specialize in one subject in order to make a good invention to help the people. Thus, specialized in one area does not only help individuals, but also helps society and other people.","[""Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life.

First, with the development of our society, young people have more chance to learn about different life on this planet through TV programs, the internet or other media. A young man always has a great interest in new things. They like to enjoy different life and are eager to get more amazing experiences. For example, in china so many older people spend so much time caring for their grandchildren, or staying at home to watch TV. They always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again.","['Young people enjoy life more than older people do? yes, i agree with this opinion.

Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail. One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"".","['I agree with the statement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than going for many.

Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem. Many countries are suffering from traffic jams. The government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jams. And one other problem as serious as the above is the environmental thing. Cars cause pollution in many ways, most seriously, the engine gas of cars makes the sky foggy and dirty. It causes contagious eye diseases, and respiratory problems. In addition, it promotes global warming which is making mankind very afraid. The carbon dioxide in the engine gas makes the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth. And then the water level rises and covers the available land of us. Maybe we will lose our whole earth to live on. If cars don't decrease, there will be a crisis of the entire human race.

First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree. Anyway now I am a military officer and preparing to enter into post graduate school for public policy majors. I could say this route is paved way. If I had been diligent in learning many academic things when I was in high school, I could have found the right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself nowadays. Lastly, specializing early may make one be partial. As balanced nutrition is very important for toddlers, balanced learning for young people. If one goes into a specific thing too early, of course she knows very much about her subject but not about other things. It can make her concentrate more on the specific, neglect more on all the rest.","[""In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject.

For example, if you do not know the concept of ""evaporation"" how are you going to know the ""process of raining"" or maybe understand some chemical process that involves the concept of ""evaporation"".

I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims. According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense.","['The ideas and concepts came from the facts.

582,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, the education systems are generally based on teaching ideas and concepts. The ideas of famous people and some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime. I think this system will not work in the near future. Because of technological advances, students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world. Thus, they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts. They will deal with the issues which they really exist. They will give more importance to the occurrences. I think it would be better when the students learn the facts, after that they can find the fundamental idea behind this fact and the students can both learn two issues by analyzing the facts. If this system is formed, the students begin to learn the issues by experiencing the living facts. The drawbavk of teaching the ideas and concepts is creating an abstract education for the students. The student may never encounter these ideas or concepts in their lifetime. However the facts are real and nobody can ignore and run away from these facts. All the students will be adults in near future and will face these facts. If they meet the facts in their school years, this experience enables them to cope with woes easily. Another essential benefit of teaching facts is improving the attention of the students. The examples of the real world will arouse their attention and I think they will want to participate in the debates about the occurrences. This system increases the efficiency of education, the other system is so boring in respect of this one.

593,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When students study, they need to understand what they study, rather than learning the facts of it.

Second, understanding of ideas and concepts will be in students' minds a longer time than learning facts. Because, there are lost of facts in all single questions. If students start to study facts, then they have to memorise all of the facts which is a bigger number than ideas and concepts. Lots of facts can be found in lots of similar type of questions However, those are similar questions, so if the students remember only one idea or concept, then they will be able to solve all of thequestions, instead of remembering all of the factors for each question. Therefore, understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts, so that will remain in students' brains for much longer. Third, ideas are much more appealing than facts when they have some other problems. When they understand the idea, they will follow on that idea and stick to lots of thinking and reach a much further idea and study more widely. However, the facts are too certain, narrow.

596,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"This is a controversial issue to define the important factor for students. Someone's priority knowledge of ideas and concepts that students gain is the most important factor in education However, others may say that experiences from facts are an important factor for students. These priorities would depend on everyone's previous life experience. In my case, I grew up in a school that gave me a mixed educational method,and that the method was equally balanced. Since I recognise mixed educational policy, both factors are key to obtaining better concepts, and at least I can say both factors were needed and just one of those would not bring a significant result. When I was an elementary school student, I learned the concept of insects. That was the first time that someone told me a concept. I was engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insects. This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant amount of knowledge even though I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insects. This experience made me realise the importance of understanding ideas brings me more knowledge. In contrast with this experience, I learned concept from fact that I faced an earthquake when I was 10 years old. At that time, I did not know what an earthquake was. First trembling came, and everybody went down stairs or desks to protect theirlife. Although I never knew such actions had to be done, I learned immediately and so did I. These actions kept me from potential damage by the earthquake. After the earthquake passed, my teacher gave us a concept. In this case, having to learn facts gave me a concrete concept and ideas of what an earthquake is. I say both factors are equally influenced and valued for better education and each is more or less valuable for better education.","[""This is a controversial issue to define the important factor for students.

And transportation has also improved a lot compared to what it was years ago. Now, airplanes, underways, and ships are widely used in transportation. But if one says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. I strongly disagree with the view. First of all, cars are really convenient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short. It can drive from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday. No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above. For this reason, more and more people will buy cars on their own. Secondly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is an example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow. Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there was no transportation to there in the past. So with the demands of the families, there will be more cars on the roads in the future. More and more families would like to have cars at that time. Lastly, we can find out that it is more and more busy on the ways now that before.

First of all, cars are really convenient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short. It can drive from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday. No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above. For this reason, more and more people will buy cars on their own. Secondly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is an example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow. Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there was no transportation to there in the past. So with the demands of the families, there will be more cars on the roads in the future. More and more families would like to have cars at that time. Lastly, we can find out that it is more and more busy on the ways now that before.', 'Maybe in the future there maybe other kinds of car to substitute the cars we are using now.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

608,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The statement at issue is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Young people are considered the seeds of hopes in a country. Helping the communities not only accumulate young people's personal experiences but expand their visions of the various and nourishing lives. I argue that young people ought to pay more attention to the communities and be willing to spend time helping the communities. Therefore, I fully agree that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping their communities. Here are some reasons why. First of all, due to the flourishing media activities, the grand and big cities are undoubtedly fascinated by young people. They are eager to leave their home towns and build up their own dreams and realize those dreams in prosperous cities. For example, in some developed countries such as Taiwan and Japan , young people enthusiastically move to those grand cities to pursue their future. Only the elderly and the children stay in their communities.","[""The statement at issue is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

609,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly disagree that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts. Currently, A lot of people do nt have a lot of time as much as a long time ago. Therefore, time has become very important in our student life. Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts.

When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example. I saw the information through a diagram of smart people,When some journalist asked a question about how they studied?

611,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I personally agree with this statement. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy, it is true. But let me tell you this; Albert Einstein has a quote: ""Knowledge is power. ""which is completely true. Think of Biology without Chemistry; Chemistry without Physics; Physics without Geometry: Geometry without Maths and so on. A chemist cannot explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without Physics, can he? Or a Physics master cannot measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lights it, can he? Another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago. Take Pascal as an example. He has a lot of proven theories in Maths  and Physics. Isn't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored in and made himself known in? The answers to these questions I pointed out are simple and true: The laws of nature, the languages spoken, people and all the others that we know of are in only one place: here on earth. No one can prove that the facts about it aren't linked to one another. The links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end, you will end up finding yourself at the other. So, learning Physics, learning Chemistry, learning Literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about. You will find yourself on the other hand if you study hard and learn a lot.

613,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"People learned a lot of kinds of knowledge in their schools. Education is a necessary point for all people to have a good life. There are many controversial topics about school and teaching methods. The statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts "" is also a big topic in education. I have studied since I was a child, and I have expenses of many kinds of teaching methods. From my experience, I agree with this idea I think that teachers can not teach everything, education gives us the ability to think. First, Teachers can not teach everything. In school, there are time limitations. It is impossible for students to learn everything in that school. For example, nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years. Do they know everything about nursing? I do not think so. Knowledge that students receive in the nursing college is just basic knowledge. In addition, knowledge is changed as research is done. In hospitals, nurses need to study nursing in depth in the critical area; nursing methods are changing everyday. Therefore, I think that teachers can not teach every fact in the school; students need to understand ideas and concepts. Lately, education gives us the ability to think: how to deal with a situation, how to solve that problem. If students only understood facts, they could not solve a different situation. However, If students know the concepts or ideas, they could use those concepts to fit the situations. In nursing, nurses care for a lot of kinds of patients: different age, gender, disease, race and culture. If nurses knew the concept of nursing care, they would change their nursing care to fit patients' conditions. If nurses did not understand the idea, they could not provide good nursing care, and patients would not have a good outcome. I think that facts show people one situation. Yet, ideas and concepts give us a lot of possibilities. In education, teachers are not able to teach everything.","['People learned a lot of kinds of knowledge in their schools.

He used to tell me to enjoy it a lot and he told me that the younger age is the age that will not return to enjoy it as much as it is possible.

628,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices. I have even come across a few parents who give their children the liberty to choose their career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects.

635,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects. Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects, I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it. First, when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic, he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth. These issues are often complex, and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable. As a result, it is possible to take a position on debated issues. For instance, I have studied psychology for many years and in my country, different types of psychology are debated now. Having this deep knowledge in this particular field, I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion. Also I can stand in a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue. In addition, I think that if I know a subject very well, it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects. As everything is related, it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways. And I believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permits us to approach very complex issues better. For example, early this year, the government of my country wanted to introduce a law involving changes in the social system. Since I had experience in this field, it was easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker's point of view, but I also enjoyed getting very interested in other points of views as legal or economic points of view.

Older people never had this great opportunity, nor the money for such a comfortable life. Second is the creation of a wide range of spare time activities. There are so many new possibilities for what one can do in leisure time, which did not exist in the time when the older people were young, and what they now cannot do any longer because of health problems. The variety goes from sports, culture, travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country. From this I want to move to the next point: foreign studies. Younger people don't even have the great opportunity to study, but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice. This is an important extraordinary experience, which has a great impact on later life. Living in a country for a period of time is something else than being on vacation. The young have the opportunity to learn really from other cultures and so probably develop a different view about many things in their early years of life. Older people can do this after years of work and can't take the chances in that way.","[""Regarding the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones, i hold the view this is true.

642,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Humans and study are connected very closely. People start to learn from when they are born. We have to learn language, ways of living, and many subjects in the school. I think the bigger knowledge is the better. It is good for people's minds, solving many problems simultaneously. First of all, knowing many things is helpful to someone's life. From learning many academic subjects, we can broaden our knowledge and common sense. Also, we can meet many people who study other fields, and speak to each other. Not only can we develop our social skills, but our thoughts are getting bigger. We can see other sides of society too. For example, there are many students who have a double major in my school. They can meet many students who have another major, and they know many professors. I think it is very helpful for students' futures. Furthermore, knowing many subjects, we can apply one thing to another. I think most subjects are related, and they have an influence on each other. If we know one subject accurately, it will help to understand other subjects. Hence, broad knowledge of many subjects is good for understanding many things. From my personal experience, when I was in high school, I solved many mathematics questions. From this process, I could also develop problem solving skills in society. I can use mathematical knowledge to solve real problems. To sum up, knowing many things has several advantages. It is good for a person's mind, also living in modern society. There is an old saying that ""Knowledge is power. ""We have to know the meaning.","['Humans and study are connected very closely. People start to learn from when they are born.

643,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior. Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman.","[""When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

655,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate. I reason when people hear about a product they should research on the internet or something like that. It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already. Maybe they can get more than money. I think most of the advertisement lies because my mother always says this one, ""if your merchants are good you do not have to call somebody to come around you and take my product.

656,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be young is beautiful.

So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society.

The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of facts -knowledge and who in fact do not read the newspapers"". Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact do not exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view.

A lot of people were convinced, that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programmes from his party or important political decisions. And in fact, I often thought similarly- until I met him one day. It was a rainy sunday and some friends of mine and I were walking through the bars of Berlin.

These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are. Thirdly, for many factories and supermarkets or sales, maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements. Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheating advertisements can perfect products.

By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results.

For example, it is also necessary to live with dignity.","['I do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do.

When one of the family members becomes ill, she needs a car. That's why an ambulance may not come immediately. However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home. They also don't go out for this reason. Moreover, telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jams. As long as people work these jobs. There aren't any traffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason. In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads. Besides telecommuting and air pollution, cars are expensive because of technology. When we look at the past, cars are more developed than in the past. Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future.

Many of the best inventions in the world were the outcome of risks taken by ordinary people, just like you and me. We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects.

He is good at what he does but just like him, many others are good likehim.

Doing what you already know to do will not take you anywhere if it is what most people do. Many of the best inventions in the world were the outcome of risks taken by ordinary people, just like you and me. We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects. A short example to help me prove my point is the following: There is a man that has been doing the same work over and over again, his life doesn't change. He is good at what he does but just like him, many others are good likehim.

689,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good.","['Imagine your life without Air?.

It is said that "" God will help them those who help themselves "" , it is implied that they take the risk and try out new things which may lead to great success. For example if Edison had not tried for a new thin he would not have invented the electric bulb. If Newton had eaten the apple, he would not have known the law of gravity. Always it is better to take calculated risks when ever required which helps us to flourish in life. When risk is taken the reward is sure some day. It is suggested that you try a new thing ,experiment which leads to development and growth in the field you are interested in. Aim for stars atleast you can seeeach moon. A good example for successful people is Gandhi, the father of the nation of india ,he tried a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took as much risk as he could , Finally he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land. Thats why the risk is always rewarded which is for a good cause for the maximum benefitof mankind. Most scientists are innovative thinkers they like to do things differently with a calculated risk and end up in getting great scientific inventions. People will be successful if they try out differently and take risks, if people take active participation in welfare for the country there will be a great development in the country and this will give confidence to people and the economic status of the country will improve.","['I agree with the author\'s statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"".

This statement may become true or false, because it is a guess but why did people believe in that guess or not. First of all I strongly believed in that statement. As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to travel by bus, subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because of improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have the chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway. That is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling. On the other hand people's choices will change while travelling along the cities; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropolis city to a tourist city in Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car. Because for making another guess; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all. Time is a valuable thing now; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay for a plane ticket for not being late for life.

Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame.

It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas.

But when the time comes for advertising this product. The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he can get profits as fast as he can. Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones. When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give. Like to give a mobile phone headset, a car charger, a mobile phone carry case, some applications, games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones. When a customer looks at this kind of advertisement he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw in the advertisement. Then the shop keeper shows him, he does not like the item. Why ? Because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones. But they find that they are not original. This causes a lot of problems when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else. I would like to share an example that I experienced a year or two ago. There is a trademark that is really popular among ladies. It sells readymade clothes for women. And his logo is also very popular. A shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost half the price of the material the original shop is selling and he advertised it in various magazines and newspapers.

Adversetising is the engine of many companies all around the world, companies that could not sell a unit of their products if they could not have access to advertising agencies. For example, everyone is aware of the dangers of drinking soda but because the companies that produce soda invest millions of dollars inadvertising, they keep selling millions of units all around the world. Another clear example that supports the statement is tobacco companies; companies like the worldwide company Phillips-Morris whose business is to sell as many cigarettes as they can, even though they are aware of the consequences of smokingas their customers do, they keep increasing their profits year after year because they great invest inadvertising, this is what permits them to show their product as something that is neither bad nor good, just as something that exists. Usually many products fail because of their marketing policies, some companies with really good products have declared bankruptcy after putting out their products without good marketing support or many companies with regular products have been successful because of it; one example of this, is that millions of clothes companies exist around the world but not all of them are known in different countries and they do not sell as the known ones do; many brands are sold in the world, brands like Tommy Hilfigher, Diesel, Perry Ellis among many, but it is not their quality or any other specific characteristics that these brands have that permit them to succeed over the companies that have no marketing policy.","['The statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is a fact.

738,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being makes it easy to succeed in their common life. First, usually successful people attract more successful people. For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends. That is, this meeting provides them with the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and these kinds of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove themselves and normally, they are going to win, the people tell us that they are lucky people. It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance. Second, two important motors of human beings' behaviour are motivation and emotion. These people are really motivated to get new experiences, learnings and knowledge. And even, this behaviour makes them pleasure by increasing some chemical substances in their brain. For example, taking new risks, such as changing the location of living, taking a new job and meeting new colleagues are really activities that pleasure them.","[""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

740,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks. The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal, he wants to have something new and more difficult to do. Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succeeded in something, he will always want more. Alpinists, for example, don't usually stop climbing after they manage to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other mountain , harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conqueror, didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finally defeated. And I think because he was successful for the first time, he couldn't get rid of his willpower. An other reason would be the fact that successful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships. Well, he is now looking forward to becoming a Formula one driver. Because he wants something new.","[""In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks.

745,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students can learn about many things in school. When students learn new things, It is very important for students to know what they are learning from classes. And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts. I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from text books. To understand the basic idea is not simply but, in my opinion, it can expand the student's abilities of thinking and creation. Understanding new ideas and concepts can take a long time and sometimes it could take a few decades for students. It can be a problem learning new things. That's why some instructors and students take shortcuts to learn new things. For example, when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio, so called 'Golden ratio' which is believed to be the perfect proportion for every object. It is a very difficult theory to understand for freshmen and it could take more than 2years, but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory. Even though it is difficult to understand the ideas, students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it. It can be easy to create new things with the basic concepts. For instance, a musician who understands the principles of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and rhythms using the basic music element. Consequently, I recommend understanding the main ideas when students learn new things. Even though it is a hard and difficult way to learn about new things, after understanding the notion from the basics.","[""Students can learn about many things in school.

749,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family. I would like to give an example of my father who is a manager in a company, When i was a toddler he taught me to take first firm few steps in the path of my life and gave me good quality education by enrolling me in a good public school where i could set fort my academicjourney, so he has the responsibility to give me a good career in the path of my life by giving much attention to me he rather by enjoying himself he gave me platform to secure me future to path of success. Also, if we look at the cut throat competition between the world there is not enough time for elderly people to enjoy life Although this same holds for younger people, they could be able to manage time for their enjoyment. It is also important for younger people to enjoy it because of the study burden because i believe that a healthy body can dwell in a healthy mind so for the future success they must be stress free. Enjoyment for younger people i believe that it is a dose for their tired nerves and if taken this dose will soothe their tired nerves and rejuvenate them for the upcomming responsibilities. This will allow him greater success throughout life as the elderly have crossed such a limit they have no more spare time to do such enjoyment. They have attended the proper opportunity of enjoyment at their time of development.","['yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people.

So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents. Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture. For instance, I learned about drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan. I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem. Now the number of old people has increased rapidly, they suffer from solitariness. But I think that young people make them active. And it is an advantage that young people learn about customs. These activities improve community problems. Next, I attend to the community's activities such as cleaning the river. The Tamagawa,one of the biggest rivers in Japan, was so beautiful 40 years ago. To improve its condition, I attend this activity. In conclusion, Japanese young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. Afterthought activities improve not only Japanese society but also the knowledge of young Japanese people.","[""I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

755,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts. Therefore the amount of money is a very important aspect of human life. Everybody has different points of views about how they must earn the money. Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger. Burger King advertisements are the most popular examples for the curious consumers to find out about their consumer rights. Last but not least, being the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the price of your product. For instance Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market. So they are able to change the price of their products, Ipod, freely. How did they become the main producer? With advertisements actually. They presumed their product would survive for 2 years, but after ten months it was almost broken down.","['Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts.

It is controversial whether the number of cars will decrease in future. The two types of viewpoints will be suggested as follows. On the one hand, some people believe that cars will be reduced in near future. The cost of maintaining a private car is increasing due to the high price of oil and public transportation services are revised these days. It would be much more comfortable to use public transportation rather than a private car. Furthermore, the new means of transportation is developing now. For example, there is the craft considered to be the means of transportation for the next generation. It provides a much more comfortable environment to ride in because it doesn't touch a surface underneath the body. If it becomes cheaper and smaller as common people can afford it, cars will be replaced by bicycles.

First, the advertisements have to sell their products, so they try to explain about their products. Then they do not want to tell disadvantages about their products, they just want to tell advantages of them. In the process, they sometimes have to cover the disadvantages. So they tell other people about their products being overly good. And other people believe what they say, and think about what they heard. People will think that the product is really good because they did not hear about its disadvantages. A good looking is tasting good. As for products, it is really important how they look. If they look good, then they seem to work better or taste better than how they are. So when people make the products, they make them look better to cover customer's eyes. And other people would believe that the products are better than they really are because they are looking good, believing looking good is better than looking bad. These days, people care so much about the products' appearance. For example, there are many different types of vending machines. They look all different.

Nowadays young people enjoy themselves well compared to in the old days. Because at this present time they have so many entertaining equipments and these all are not available in the olden days. And the world is developing rapidly. At a time, young people also worked hard to achieve their goals and to realise their ambitions. They are doing hardwork and enjoy it at a time. They separate their time for working and for enjoying themselves. Now these days so many young people are working for many great companies and corporate companies,then they all work weekly for five days for company and the remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family. So young people also do hardwork but they make some schedule and follow that. Now so many young people are working for some company or worked for some institute,But these companies and institutes are built by old people. So old people work in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run those institutes and companies. From the above two sentences i can say that old people work harder than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels. And these days also have some young managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists,But they all get that companies and that industry from their parents and they run those companies verywell. Suppose Anil Abani is a great industrialist and great managing director for Reliance companies. But he gets them from his father and he also works hard and develops their companies and develops their shares in the present market. So finally i am supporting that young people enjoy their life more than older people and they also work hard and get good positions in their lives.

773,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this statement. No matter whether successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing. Successful people try new things and taking risks are the best thing that they need to do. For example, an animal professor who discovers medicine for humans. If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have, so this is not called discovery and they are no longer needed. Of course they need to find new medicines and it involves risks because they test animals. Another example is students who are successful in studying. Why are they successful? The reason is they already try new things such as reading a lot of different books and communicating with teachers. The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required. If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful students? They will stay the same without studying new things. They cannot only study what they know well. Otherwise, they cannot be open-minded. For me, I have a personal story about this topic. I am trying new things and also taking risks. I came to America for study. I am trying to study new cultures and languages. I am not successful yet, but I am trying to be successful. Also this is a risk for me because my parents cannot afford me to study at university in America. The tuition is too high. My parents have to take care of me and my brother.

And also the government can not take radical decisions about traffic because everyone has a right to use his or her own car everywhere he or she wants. because of this there are not fewer cars in use or we can say that there are lots of cars in use now and it will be the same in the future in conclusion because most people would like to have a car and do not think about the solution to traffic jams there wo not be fewer.","[""some people think that cars are not very necessary for our daily life but some people also think that cars have very important roles in our lives.

In fact this reason is really a considerable one, which is why people can not change their opinion. for example I have a car and when I want to go somewhere my first option is to take my car. instead of taking buses or walking. and I am really sure most drivers think just like me. because it is the most comfortable one , even though it is not the cheapest one. the second reason is that people do not consider the traffic problem and this problem should be solved by the government. they think that the government should make big wide roads and design perfect traffic regulations. people just use their cars and don't think one of the reasons for the traffic jam is their cars. And also the government can not take radical decisions about traffic because everyone has a right to use his or her own car everywhere he or she wants."", 'because of this there are not fewer cars in use or we can say that there are lots of cars in use now and it will be the same in the future in conclusion because most people would like to have a car and do not think about the solution to traffic jams there wo not be fewer.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
787,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"".","[""I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

788,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I would say that I do not agree either disagree with both of the statements.

An idea could be difficult to explain, but with a fact, an example, the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to memorize. As an example, I can speak about the french revolution.","['I would say that I do not agree either disagree with both of the statements.

789,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Long has been written about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do, as well as how old people enjoy life more than young people do. Nevertheless, I consider that enjoying life has more to do with people's attitude toward life than with them being young or old. Therefore, I will try to describe some ideas in order to support the view that enjoying life has much more to do with an attitude than with age. For example, many people might think that enjoying life may be related to age. Therefore, if you are a young person you could enjoy life more than if you are an old person. Old people might think that young people have much more energy, or more activities in a day and therefore they enjoy life much more than them. The only thing they don't stop thinking about is that usually young people don't have as much spare time as old people could have.","[""Long has been written about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do, as well as how old people enjoy life more than young people do.

Younger people would say I am old enough to go out of the family and experience the world. In the year 2006, many things happened to me. I went to the United States of America for the first time, and have been a student at a college. I had to experience everything in a foreign language, English. Imagine, It still might have been hard if I was a student in my country, but i had to do it in a foreign country. It gave me new experiences in my life. I had to make my decisions on my own. My family and my friends were too far from me to give advice. It was a hard year for me. So younger people enjoy their life more than older people do. Young people might feel the world and think in their own ways but they still stay in a particular place like a house, school or by their friends.

792,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects,while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject. As for me, I would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only. Though there are a variety of subjects at a university for you to follow with. But a single man's energy and time are so limited that you can't afford wasting too much time on subjects that have nothing to do with your future career. Imagine a freshman majoring in Physics with a Selection Of English Literature in hand all day around, will he succeed in his field someday? Hardly. Furthermore, we call these ""academic subjects"" because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school. They are far more complex and complicated. You can't expect to manage it within a semester or two. It needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level in a certain field. Some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because of an affection on the spur of the moment, as soon as he realizes that he won't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever, he will just simply drop halfway. Finally, having a determination to specialize in a single subject is a crucial step on your way to self-realization. Anybody who wants to be successful and legendary in his field must have perseverance and expertise. Michael Jordan may be a good example.","['Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects,while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject.

794,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations. I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products. So it will even cause the situation worse than now. From those kinds of accounts I expressed my opinion.","[""Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations.

802,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities. However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry for her and regretted focusing on just the quantity of the feasible time. In addition, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never shows one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is an example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyers in Korea. He is renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedication to society. It is evident that he has limited time to do multiple things at the same time.","[""Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities.

803,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow. One, from my personal experience, traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by yourself. Because the travel company which the guide is affiliated with always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights. In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took. Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes. According to the 8 years of personal travel experience, most travel accidents occur in a group traveler. Because when we travel in a group by a tour guide, people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide. And that causes accidents such as robbery. One of my roommates once traveled to Spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated. And he paid attention.","[""First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow.

Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same. I believe, traffic is not just a waste of time; in addition, it is a waste of energy. For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour.","['Any other expression would not be more important than this topic.

However, I support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years for the following reasons. First, the price of energy will become higher than today. For example, many people prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy. Many car makers are making their efforts to produce cars which need not so much energy, though, such cars are high cost. In addition, there is difficulty in developing new laws that cost energy. As the above explanation demonstrates, in the future, people will use fewer cars than there are today. Second, environmental problems change people's way of thinking about traffic methods. For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city environmental problems are so serious. Originally Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had not so much a train network. However, the South Korean government improved the capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people. The government will continue such efforts to make Seoul's air clean. Trains seem to replace the car-centric traffic system.

The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here.

819,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Is there fewer cars in twenty years than there are today? Although there are many variables and uncertainties that may affect the number of cars, I agree with the statement. First, air pollution is getting more and more serious. In the last century, human beings have made too many cars. In some big cities, the exhaust of cars is the main cause of breath illness. The government also notices that, and it tries to prevent the problem getting worse. One way is to reduce the number of cars. Besides, driving in the rush hour in the city drives all drivers crazy, and it is almost impossible to find a parking space in the down town. The traffic problem in the city also attracts people to go to work by taking public transportation, and gives up their desire to own their cars.

The government also notices that, and it tries to prevent the problem getting worse. One way is to reduce the number of cars. Besides, driving in the rush hour in the city drives all drivers crazy, and it is almost impossible to find a parking space in the down town. The traffic problem in the city also attracts people to go to work by taking public transportation, and gives up their desire to own their cars.

I know I will become like my thinking. So I have to enjoy my life now. However, older people enjoy their life by using money. They go on big trips, to get houses, and to eat rich foods etc. This enjoyment is different to young people's enjoyment. They want to relax. They won't use such a weapon.

In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads.

835,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Whether to be a person who is equipped with plenty of knowledge from all kinds of academic subjects or just to be a professor in one field is not a straightforward issue. Everyone keeps their own opinion on it. While it comes to me, I would say that being a professor is more beneficial. First of all, people should save their energy from obtaining knowledge from all categories of fields, which does good for our advanced education. Energy, just like time for humans, is limited. With this limited energy, one can do what he or she likes to do. But, once distributed too widely, it can't be a professor in a certain field. For example, we know that teachers in the elementary school can teach almost all the courses that are provided. However, if the child grows up and enters college, no one can be responsible for all the classes. What he or she needs is a professor who knows a lot about a particular subject, not a teacher with a lot of knowledge from different subjects. In addition, people with a great number of knowledge in some special field help solve the social problems.","[""Whether to be a person who is equipped with plenty of knowledge from all kinds of academic subjects or just to be a professor in one field is not a straightforward issue.

836,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. There should be an energy when young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the environment they live in. It is sad that people can't see young people attending the activities of their communities. The reasons that cause this situation are competition, education and value. First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate in any activities. There is more stress on their shoulders, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and perform well in school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes. They have to sacrifice their playing time to achieve their goal. They try to get into a public university because the tuition is higher than before. There are many people who may not afford it.","[""I agree that most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant amount of knowledge even though I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insects. This experience made me realise the importance of understanding ideas brings me more knowledge. In contrast with this experience, I learned concept from fact that I faced an earthquake when I was 10 years old. At that time, I did not know what an earthquake was.

For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight. Secondly, there is a huge use of celebrities in the advertisements that gives a false image of what a product really is.

So when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol whouses this ' it might work for me too. So ' i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change as i thought.

First of all, we can use the internet to do many things. For instance, people in the feature will work at home and use the internet to do their job. Students don't go to school anymore, because they use the internet to complete the group discussion, or find something about the assignment from a teacher who teaches them through the internet. In addition, it is more convenient to travel around by train or airplane. The train or airplane will be improved. For example, the price of the train and airplane will be very low, Does anyone want to drive by himself or herself or herself? taking the train or airplane is more efficient than driving your own car. Finally, in the city, you can use a bus or subway to go to anyplace you want. If you own a car, you will pay huge taxes on the car, and drive it out a few times. It was a waste of money. the money should be used in other better ways. Furthermore, in japan, they usually go to the train station by bicycle, it is very convenient less polluting , and good for your health. In summary, we can use the internet to do many things.

I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part. You should know everything about this part. I want to give an example. If you want to specialize in marketing,you have to know everything about it. You can only be hired in this part of a firm. And if you are not needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked. But if you have knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm. A third advantage of broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things. you can learn new things in all parts of academic life. It would be boring if you did the same things the whole of your life. A broad knowledge gives you the possibility that you can change your work. Your life would be more exciting. To finish the text I want to give reasons why this is in my opinion. I am studying Business.","['First of all I want to say, what the question deals with.

866,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In the above paragraph author states that successful people take more resources rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings. so it was flying in the air. The Wrights brothers are different and take more risks to implement an aeroplane. Therefore what i am saying is that the people who are thinking differently from what they already know. If they are thinking similarly about the work. They don't get any new ideas and they do not succeed in that particular work. I conclude that the successful people who already know the work how to do well in that time also have a chance to implement the new things,but they are not thinking in a broader way. the successful people are always trying to implement new things,because they already know how to do the work. To implement new things it takes more time and enthusiasm to learn the work then only then are they committed to implementing the new things.","[""In the above paragraph author states that successful people take more resources rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings. so it was flying in the air. The Wrights brothers are different and take more risks to implement an aeroplane. Therefore what i am saying is that the people who are thinking differently from what they already know. If they are thinking similarly about the work. They don't get any new ideas and they do not succeed in that particular work.

867,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago. The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need.","[""I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

Alternative solutions are found with inventions. So though it may sound strange after looking at the ever increasing sales graphs of the auto companies,I feel there will be fewer cars after twenty years than there are today. Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers. Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call. Retail giants like walmart and food kings like McDonalds are accessible over short distances. These things virtually eliminate the need to go out,drive and shop. With the advent of the internet, it is very much possible to work from home. With means like video conferencing the members of a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe. E-learning has opened new horizons. Classes and even archives are available online. These things help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest, reducing the need to go out everyday. The population is a huge problem faced by many countries as it is linked with limited resources like land. It results in heavy traffic seen on the roads. Most automobiles today run on petrol products which are getting extinct.","['""Need is the mother of invention"" When needs change the things which are commonplace today change like a dream.

I have two reasons for this opinion: energy and freedom. First of all, I think that young people are able to exercise harder than older people because they are young, so they have a lot of energy in general. In my grandfather's case, he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even huge things when he was 21 years old. Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured himself when he was in junior high-school. I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster and play some sports when you are 70 years old. Secondly, I claim that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think. It is because older people have their husbands or wives in many cases. Of course, if you are young and not married, you can have a boyfriend or girlfriend freely. While it may be true that not every young person can fall in love with someone, and older people tend to have more money than young people. However, young people are given freedom.","[""Without questions,I agree with this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do.

875,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior. Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession. Another reason ,I believe that taking risks and trying new things brings success because it brings creativity in a person which leads to success in life. When we try new things in life then our brain works faster and we feel more challenging. Anil Ambani is the biggest example. He had a creative mind who always tried to do something new and take risks.","[""When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

878,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue.

I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more. Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future. They become more selfish. To sum up, given the reasons above discussion, I agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Because they are educated more selfishly, most of them concerned themselves more than others. In addition, they prefer to the other noticeable things to make their life more exciting and interesting. Meanwhile, they don't have enough opportunities to get in touch with their communities. They lack connections and interactions between families, schools and communities.

But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned it.

So both sides have their positive and negative arguments. The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand. Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not really understand or would you be better off with some information you can handle and understand? Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just too huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it. So one should not concentrate on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) and one should not just learn facts.

882,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,Over the last fifty decades education has been a significant role in people's lives. Because of that they have research into lots of subjects or just one. Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other people think that the better one is to specialize in one specific subject. First of all having a knowledge of many subjects does not mean having lots of essential things. People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use them together. Because those are different things. But when people are taking some research into similar subjects it can help them with lots of things. Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas. Because of that people can prefer this way. Secondly specializing in one specific subject can be more acceptable to everyone.

Knowing lots of things can get a number of opportunities which can help us in our social or daily life.,"[""Over the last fifty decades education has been a significant role in people's lives. Because of that they have research into lots of subjects or just one. Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other people think that the better one is to specialize in one specific subject. First of all having a knowledge of many subjects does not mean having lots of essential things. People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use them together. Because those are different things. But when people are taking some research into similar subjects it can help them with lots of things. Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas. Because of that people can prefer this way. Secondly specializing in one specific subject can be more acceptable to everyone.

890,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. First, we always choose the same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to the supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys the same snack. One day, I asked him, "" Why do you choose the same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watch this snack's commercial on television, then I think that this snack tastes good, so I always choose this one. ""I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he is influenced by television commercials , so he always chooses the same snack. Second, we always believe in the content of commercials. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food. My father asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy expensive natural food? ""My sister answered,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food. ""However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there was a lot of value in her natural food, but it was the same as normal food. She was influenced by the advertisement that included her book. Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercials, radio commercials, magazines, books, newspapers, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show the correct information. The meaning of an advertisement is to sell a lot of goods, so when we buy any good, we should research a lot of information, and we should ask for opinions from family or friends. If we can collect a lot of information, we can choose the correct good. I think that correct information is more important than influence by advertising.

They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together.

I can't stop asking why young people don't want to be involved in activities, which can improve the quality of life in their community. Lack of time is the first most popular answer. Nowadays youngsters are very busy: if the school doesn't give them enough homework, parents will find some extra - curricularactivities. Friends are also important, and something done with them seems to them to have more worth than something done for the community. Helping the community brings not only benefits to the community itself, but also to those who participate in the activity.

I totally agree with people who say that you must take many risks to plan a successful career. For example, if you want to open a restaurant, you must risk a part of your own money to have sufficient funds to buy all the equipment a restaurant needs. If you don't want to take this risk, you'll never open your restaurant. But only taking risks will not guarantee a successful career, I think you must be innovant to achieve this objective. By doing only what you can do, you'll never progress because you don't try to experiment with a new type of work and I think successful people are in constant progress to be the most competitive in their field of activity. And if they fail in a project, they can totally change their activity because they are more adaptable. So experimenting with new things is very useful to have success because the world is changing every day and it will not adapt to you, you will adapt to it. Imagine a grocery which only sells apples.

898,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people. Some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide, they think that it is more quiet and peaceful. As for me, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. But I disagree with considering it as the best way to travel. First, most people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel. In some scenarios, it may be very dangerous for travelers. For example, if you travel alone in a forest where modern technology can not be used to communicate with the outside world. Imagine if you missed your way in the forest, met some dangerous animals or got injured by accident, how would you continue your journey. In this situation, it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide. Your friends can help you if there are really some bad things happening. And since there is a tour guide, the opportunity to experience some bad things may decrease. So you can totally enjoy your trip without always worrying about all kinds of situations. second, common sense tells us that human beings are social animals. So for most people, they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone. Imagine, you and your friends on a trip , you can talk about some funny things, you can share some feelings, or play card with your friends. People in groups will make you travel more interesting, you have more things to do. However, if you travel alone without a tour guide, you are deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends. However, I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Because modern society provides us with many opportunities to choose. Some people can choose to travel the other way by their own option. But I recommend them to prepare enough and gather materials about their travel route carefully to resist potentially dangerous events that may happen to them. So, generally, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide as a very good way to travel. Since, you may get more pleasures. And the travel is safer for you. But I think that travelling in other ways is still a good way for some people to prepare well.","['Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people.

In this situation, it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide. Your friends can help you if there are really some bad things happening. And since there is a tour guide, the opportunity to experience some bad things may decrease. So you can totally enjoy your trip without always worrying about all kinds of situations. second, common sense tells us that human beings are social animals. So for most people, they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone. Imagine, you and your friends on a trip , you can talk about some funny things, you can share some feelings, or play card with your friends. People in groups will make you travel more interesting, you have more things to do. However, if you travel alone without a tour guide, you are deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends. However, I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Because modern society provides us with many opportunities to choose. Some people can choose to travel the other way by their own option. But I recommend them to prepare enough and gather materials about their travel route carefully to resist potentially dangerous events that may happen to them. So, generally, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide as a very good way to travel. Since, you may get more pleasures. And the travel is safer for you.', 'But I think that travelling in other ways is still a good way for some people to prepare well.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you.

Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone.

When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do. But any group in this situation would be disappointed. Finally, there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone, you are not alone. It means that going on a trip alone allows you to make friends. For instance, I went to Japan when I was a freshman at university. I had been travelling for a month. I could not speak Japanese fluently on that tour, I could make friends - Nakasaki, Murama, and Yorisimo. It was an unforgettable experience. When you are with your fellows, you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends.

The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future.

If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"". In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation. Due to gravity whatever things are thrown in the air from theearth's surface will fall on the earth again because of the gravitational pull of the earth. If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from the earth will fall back to the earth's surface,then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason why. Due to this type of learning none of the students will become good engineers or any other professionals.

In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"". In this the idea is about the Earth\'s gravitation. Due to gravity whatever things are thrown in the air from theearth\'s surface will fall on the earth again because of the gravitational pull of the earth. If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from the earth will fall back to the earth\'s surface,then they just learn the fact. They don\'t know the reason why. Due to this type of learning none of the students will become good engineers or any other professionals.', 'Because of lack of concepts and practical knowledge.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

There are three opinions in my mind to talk about why i disagree with this statement. At the beginning of the statement, I think one of the important reasons that people can be successful is because successful people have already done this thing as they are successful ,they use more time than other people , they continue their work all day , not give it up,so they are successful. It is not too easy to be successful for every successful person. Second, successful people do the same as other people. They just have more experiences than other people , At this time, they would have many experiencesto fair when they do this thing but nobody knows it. Successful people are not cleverer than other people,only harder working than other people. Third, new things not only have already been tried to , they need more time to think and to get some information to find some notes about them,successful people can not try new things when they have not already. Therefore, they change some opinions which they already know how to do well. It is too bad for successful people.

Because by understanding the idea only a student can make decisions correctly. By understanding the concepts he or she can judge easily and can get through it. Most of the students understand the idea so that they can do things better and get a grip on that particular idea and also they can learn more things about the idea they learnt. For example a student preparing for his exams is coming over in a few days, to get rid of that he must read properly so that he does not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need to mug up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam.","['Yes i agree with the concept of discussing that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better.

Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured himself when he was in junior high-school. I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster and play some sports when you are 70 years old. Secondly, I claim that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think.

I agree with the quote that says ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"", for many different reasons. A person who tries new things in his life, will gain experience and knowledge. Taking risks and learning new things will develop a person emotionally and physically. It is a good thing for a person to be adventurous, and go through different kinds of situations, because it helps him learn new things and lessons in life. By learning these new lessons, and by being more experienced, a person will suddenly see himself optimistic,and happy. His reason for living will increase, because he will love life more, and would like to do new stuff that will entertain, and teach him. I think that a risk taker is a very confident person, who knowswhat he wantsin life, and he is lucky to have this characteristic. It is a positive action that each person must choose to succeed in life, unlike the people that only do what they know. These people that are not risk takers will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life. They will regret not being risky, and not doing and trying everything new in life, and will hope and wish for time to go back, and do whatever they did not do. The difference between these two kinds of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new things and lessons in life, while the other is being self- -reliant , scared, and lazy, and he will not succeed in life as much as the confident, risk taker.

976,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is quite difficult. There are three points to discuss about this question. The first point is that having broad knowledge can help you in finding a job because as much as you know as varied can be the fields in with you can deal with. Moreover you will be able to take part in a variety of subjects with people and this can help you to socialise when you are in a new environment with people you don't know. Third, you can link different information and create a personal point of view. On the other hand, specializing in a certain subject can help you to become a leader in your job field and an expert. Furthermore you can speak deeply about your subject in a conversation, and you can use it to appeal to people who listen to it and make a strong impression. Finally, you can teach or give specific information to other people in a conversation helping them to understand new matters far away from their fields of interest. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge and I am quite sure that broad knowledge is better than specific knowledge. My experience teaches me this. I attended Social and political studies at university and this is a very broad knowledge course. :Later in life it has been really useful in my job, in understanding the world and making me flexible in learning new tasks. For all these reasons, I think it can be helpful in daily life and for yourself as a human being. In the end, I think one must stop learning in life, I would like to continue to study the subjects i like and learn new ones that can help me to be a better person.","[""The question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is quite difficult.

977,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"""Innovation is the mother of success "" I strongly support the prompt that successful people try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

The first one is that he will earn profit for himself which is a positive aspect of the risk taken. But on the other hand there is equal probability of his failure which is a negative aspect. In my opinion,both of them can't be stated as success. Because real success is to learn from failure and then hit your target again,but this time with full preparation and timing. Then I am sure that the person will not lose again. This implies that a person learns from his failure. Yes, I agree that,success comes to those who try new things and with proper planning. But its not only trying new things without even pondering over them. If a person takes a risk to gamble then its his luck that will win one time or two but its not that he will win. Its just a waste of money andtime. So risk should be taken in the right direction. It should not be in a vague direction. Let's have an example of the great industrialist of India Late DhiruBhai Ambani, founder of Reliance Group.

Because their function is to make products look nice to sell. and In modern society which has a lot of products, they have to get an opportunity to sell through the appearance of theproduct. The advertisements are capacity to sell efficiently. That's why they try to show the products seem much better than themselves. Without using the product, nobody knows the ability of the product. Before the customers choose some products, they hesitate. To them who are confused by the choice, advertisements have to make them purchase their own products. How? Through charming fashion. They have to suggest to the customer before they choose some products through that the products seem nice. Additionally, nowadays all technology has been improving. So the copy of some product is so easy. If some company invent the product which attracts customers, as soon as other companies also make similar products. In so many choices of the same product, customers try to compare with other companies. In the same technology, it might be the same ability of product. Then, how to sell more than other companies? The answer is the advertisement. But other companies also try to make nice advertisements. Then how to show that our products are better than other products?

992,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I totally disagree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I disagree with this because I am a young person who spends enough time helping my community. Why am I so sure that young people give enough time to helping their communities? First, I would like to say that at my university, there are numerous clubs dedicated to devoting. I am one of these clubs' members. We go to some retirement associations to chat with old people. Some of them have children, but their children are too busy to go to meet them. So we go there to accompany them and to clean the environment. Sometimes we go to meet children who lost their parents. Most of them are still very young, but do have enough love from family. So we become their brothers or sisters. We go there to teach and give them love. Moreover, all students at my university must help the community. This is the course we must take, if we do not serve, we will not graduate. Although some students are reluctant to do this, after they help the community, all of them are happy and willing to do the service by volunteering. Finally, I do not disagree that some people say we do not give enough time to helping.","[""I totally disagree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

993,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In twenty years we will live in a different world in which we will have completely avoided pollution by wasting as little natural resources as possible. In my opinion, we have already experimented successfully with methods to achieve this aim consuming less oil and using more bicycles and public transport. As a matter of fact the cost of the bus ticket is going down because people are starting again to consider this way of transport as a valid alternative to their own car and as the easiest possibility to save money ( nowadays, the cost of oil is growing too much and,on average,only 2 people per 5 are available to spend a lot of money onit ) and to avoid being stuck in the traffic of the city center. But refusing to drive cars and choosing to go to work by foot or to reach university by bicycle is also a good motivation to keep fit and to do an everyday-life gym without spending any money which can help us to maintain our youth and to look younger and better as long as possible in order to teach our children or grand children to respect nature and to improve our physical attitude simply by using an alternative transport to cars. In fact,cars (as we are used to thinking of them) are doomed to be fewer because we will improve the prototype for a different way to give locomotion to them. Recent studies have asserted that it is possible to make cars work by involving hydrogene instead of oil and it could pollute and cost ever less than a traditional car. So, I am sure that cars in twenty years will disappear and we will be able to support the disappearance of alternative transport better because technology is working to give us the best of itself in order to improve the quality of our life.","['In twenty years we will live in a different world in which we will have completely avoided pollution by wasting as little natural resources as possible.

I have some friends who are NEET. They have free time, so they can enjoy life without thinking about time or dates. Now, I am a graduate student. I work in my laboratory from early morning to late at night everyday. I am busy everyday, so I am always thinking that I want to have a rest. For me, I sometimes envy NEET\'s life because they have freedom. However, I don\'t think that it is good that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I have 2 reasons. First, young people need a lot of money if they want to enjoy life like older people. But in most cases, many young people earn so much money.

1014,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I kind of disagree with this statement.

The  happening of the earthquake in indonesia is a fact. I need to know it to understand my concept better. Facts are important in order to understand the concept. You can not say that fact does not worth it. Without fact no concept and no idea take place. Facts are the life of concepts. One more example here is that countries in the southern hemisphere have a warmer climate and countries in the northern hemisphere have a cooler climate. How can i prove this statement? I will give all my geographical reasons and explanation. How can I prove all my geographical reasons? Now to have facts is important. If i say that the United States is in the Northern Hemisphere and that is why it has a cloudy climate, and Sri Lanka is in the Southern Hemisphere and that is why it has a warm climate.","['I kind of disagree with this statement.

1020,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Industrial engineering is a profession having a broad area that has become more popular in our country recently. It is thought that studying everything a little is better than specializing in one area. However in my opinion it is not a good idea. Firstly, people with a broad range of interests can not learn and use everything well. It is obvious that human beings have a capacity and this can be only enough for some extend. Specializing on a specific subject makes it possible to use all your effort for it. Hence you will be more powerful in that area. Secondly, studying everything may be useful for someone to see the big picture and see some problems easier. however fixing the problems usually needs to be an expert. For example knowing accounting and computer programming may help you to define a problem in the accounting software, but only a software expert can fix it. Lastly, think about the inventions that are really essential for our life. For example electricity, engines, computers, and so on. All of these are a product of long training on a certain subject. This process is an increasingly learning process and it does not have an end. Hence, people should use all their effort to achieve the point that they can achieve.

1021,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts. The reason is that understanding ideas and concepts is more creative activity for students. When we try to understand the ideas and concepts, we must consider lots of factors of ideas and concepts. First we must confirm whose ideas or concepts they are, to add more information to them as the backgrounds. Next, we make an analysis of why they have the ideas or the concepts using acquired background information. After these practices, we can approach the stage to make answers or own opinions. To get answers or opinions, students can have a discussion with friends, parents, and brothers. In addition, they can get some suggestions from their teachers or they can also conduct investigations using books or the internet to add more information. I think that these consequent practices are very important for students to develop their way of thinking. In contrast, learning facts does not need such pressures. It is easy to access the facts without any kind of thinking. To learn facts, students just sit down on their seats in the class room and just listen to what their teacher says. In this case, the information is only given from their teacher to students. If students listen to what their teacher says and write it down in their notebook, they can get new knowledge.","['I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts.

First it allows a person to share the ideas which are provided by the other travels and sometimes the person will learn from his group.

As a result of this a person becomes a jack of all Trades but master of none.

1032,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"As far as I am concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. A student, in general, even if he has the idea of what to do in his working future, does not always match his dreams with the real life. It can happen that the economic situation at the beginning of his studies could be very different from the one at the end of his studies. This can happen for several reasons, such as political, economic, and so on. If a student starts to concentrate only on a specific subject, that can be for example, literature , at the end of his studies I will be very well educated on that subject, but in a world that is requiring people that have technological skills. It is important to say that a student that is involved in many academic subjects will be able to manage all of it, but he will always have the possibility to specialize in one of them. I want to say that the best choice to make is to study many academic subjects because it is always possible to specialize in one specific subject during the study period. On the other hand it is always more difficult to change its own study plan from a specific subject to many academic subjects. Only if a student has the chance to study different academic subjects can he also have the opportunity to discover his talent in subjects that he did not know that he was able to do. Sometimes talent is hidden and only a good teacher can help students to reveal it. Students, if they decide to study only a specific academic subject, will not give the chance to any professor to discover their talent. The Italian University educational approach is based on many academic subjects that can give students the opportunity to learn different topics and also not linked from each one. Only after university , can they choose to specialize in one specific subject. I can see that Italian students, in the end, are more prepared than USA students, these latter are too specialized in only one subject and unable to face real life so different and changeable.","['As far as I am concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

For example, I participate in a clean up activity around the central station of my city. This activity is held every week and young people who live in my city are strongly encouraged to attend, however, there are few young people among the participants. This example clearly shows that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Second, the vote rate of young people in elections in Japan is generally much less than that of elderly people, although joining the political process of communities is an important activity to keep their communities active and healthy. To join the political process, the voter must have their opinion about their communities. If young people participate in their communities, they should have some opinion about the situation or future of their communities, and they should have a strong incentive to go voting. This is the reason why I think young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Third, there are many companies which help elderly people with their house hold errands and chores.

1034,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with this statement. The reason is that in the twenty years there were not many cars in use as now or because people could not afford to buy one. If we look at history, the twenty years were not many successful for many people. For example, in the United States although there was a period of health in the early twenties and people could afford to buy cars, in the last years of the century the Depression let many people withoutjobs, houses and without even necessary items. As well in Europe, as always, there were so many status differences between people that only rich people had the opportunity to get cars. However, today there are a lot of different models of cars and you can buy a car cheaper than in those years. For example, now a little car that allows you to drive along the city costs about 6,000 euros that is a reasonableprice. Also, nowadays, you have the chance of buying a car and paying for it every month for several years, so even young people having good jobs can afford to drive their own cars.

Facts are implemented earlier, before facts ideas and concepts are developed, with these development of ideas and repeatedly occurring of the same thing they were recorded as facts. Some facts may help the student but with out concepts these facts may not be understood clearly.', 'Facts are those they are already implemented.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
1040,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the statement that""Young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities"". Because young people nowadays have become very responsible and honest towards their customers. The young people of today are working more and they earn high salaries,but they are always first in helping the communities the best example is helping the people ,who are victims of the tsunami. The students community and graduates collected the money and the clothesand distributed it to affected people. All over the world, people say that the future of any country or place liesin the hands of the young,it seems to me that it is correct. In particular, in developing countries, educated young people are playing major in the elections,and they are always ready to help the uneducated people. The young people are working very hard to get in to this highly competitive world, they are having less time to help society.","['I disagree with the statement that""Young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities"".

1041,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do? To answer this question is important to take two points of view, the first one is to answer why young people enjoy life, and then answer why old people enjoy life, and finally i will see who enjoy life more, young people or older people. I think that younger people enjoy life, because they are in an age where everything is known, they are exploring the world, they are dreaming, they are building their goal, which is a wonderful moment in life. It is when people start to grow up , and during this process they understand and respond to many questions that only living can answer, It is a stage when you can make a mistake, and it is ok because you are learning, no one is going to judge you, It is part of learning. I think that i am in a great moment of my life, I feel and I am young, and if i take my own experience i can say that i really enjoy my life, i had difficulties in my life but they were just part of it, sometimes you need to feel and then stand up and go on, thats life. By the other hand, i think that older people also enjoy life, because no matter the age that you have you will always learn , and at this point in your life you have more experience, so you dont have to worry about if you are going to make a mistake, because you know that if you make it everything will be ok. For example my grand ma was an old lady, but she was a kid, she never felt old, she always learning , and at this point in her life she had more experience ,t do when se was a child so she didn't have to worry about it. Know she is death, but she teaches that life is only one and you have to enjoy it, no matter your age.","[""Young people enjoy life more than older people do?

1042,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I fully agree with the claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This method of teaching has been widely known and is used by students all over the world. And I agree with this method because I believe students require full understanding of concepts therefore they could have longer knowledge, and create their own thoughts through understanding the concepts. First of all, the most effective way to learn things would be understanding concepts and ideas. Since students get to understand its concepts or the ideas, it makes them fully understand it and also, it remains in students' minds and it becomes part of their knowledge for longer than when they learn its facts. For instance, from my personal experience, I only remember a few mathematical formulas or the scientific terms that I memorised when I was in middle school. Moreover, I could only memorise a few things even from last year which facts I have learned. On the other hand, I can crystalize things that I have experienced. For instance, I have clear memories that I have learned from experiments in biology class which I experienced in my younger age. In fact, understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students and is a more effective way to learn than it is for them to learn facts. Secondly, Understanding the concepts makes students able to think further. Interestingly, most of the great inventions such as the phone and computers came from basic understanding of the concepts. Thus, sometimes facts work well for students to learn complex things.","[""I fully agree with the claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

1043,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I strongly believe that successful people tend to face and challenge new things and tasks rather than doing one thing they can do well. First of all, those who are changing constantly can succeed now. Some people think that doing one thing continuously is more efficient than doing many things. However, It is now not available. Nowadays, everything is so fast and complex. So people can easily feel bored at the same thing. For example, as many people know, the rock group 'Radiohead' is still popular. They have been singing for more than ten years. there were many popular rock groups at that time. Radiohead changed their music style and challenged new things that people had never heard. If they had had stock in their one style of music, they could not have continued their popularization. Furthermore, challenging new things and facing new tasks are more exciting and refreshing. Only doing onething makes people feel bored and lazy. people who are lazy can not be better than those who are excited about doing something. suppose you have to eat hamburger everyday. Even if the hamburgers are delicious, you would be sick of having the same food. Moreover, While people challenge new things people can learn new skills. we do not need to try something which we already know how to do well.","[""People often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

However, I firmly believe that helping their communities is quite an important thing in their life. First of all, We can not live by ourselves. we have to help each other. of course that is an option and we can choose whatever we want, but nowadays, It would be harder and harder if people tried to live bythemselves. If we try to spend our time in communities, It can be a good way to get to know many people who can help us when we get into a hard time. For example, I was trying to have my own piano recitle in my communites. and I heard that is not so easy. but fortunately I was a volunteer in my community last summer and through that experience, I had a chance to get to know lots of people who could help me. so I could have a report very easily because of their recommendations. Secondly, we can improve our social skills. nowadays, people tend to be isolated. but I dont think that is the best way to live. For example, I have a friend and she always tries to be alone in her room. I thought she enjoyed her time by herself but one day, she got a disease and It was depression. If she tried to live out of her room, she would get sick.","['It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities or not. some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their communities.

That's why people try to work hard on studying or exploring. Then successful people tend to try new thing s and take risks because of three befits; new opportunities , high outcomes, and freeness. First of all, trying new things has new opportunities. Because no one has done it before, if people pursue new things, they can be the first people in a particular field. I-pod examinations this outcome. Because the creator of the I-pod made the first creative MP3, the I-pod became the symbol of MP3, making many profits.

If people avoid taking risks and bet just a small amount of money. they are never going to be the same status throughout their lives. Successful people, for example, spend a large amount of money to build a new office instead of limiting risks, they created a great office, making employees comfortable and willing to do their tasks. Finally, trying and taking risks have freedom leading to success. As I said, no one has done it before, people exploring new things do not have to follow existing rules or retrospects.

Furthermore, young people are more attracted by the colourful world rather than staying at home. They are afraid of grounding because it is indispensable for them to have fun.

Moreover, they will not bother how much money they have left. Instead, they will have a great time spending the money to find their dream beautiful life. Finally, young people can endure the challenges. An example is, they will challenge new stuff to know the right way to enjoy life even including doing drugs.","['Some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

1056,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students. Actually from my point of view, facts are the same important just as ideas and concepts. First, without facts, how come the ideas and concepts? Ideas and concepts can not be separated from facts. For example, when we learn the concept of force in physics, students need to do experiments to be aware of the fact that there are different kinds of force everywhere in the world. The teacher will confuse the students if he or she just draws a symbol and points it at them, then says "" Look, it is what we call force"". By doing this, the teacher is at the rick of being fired.","['I disagree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students.

He would be responsible for all the needs they want. I personally disagree with the assertion that going with a tour guide is the best way to travel. First of all, traveling with a group could waste a lot of time waiting for another person. And it is very inconvenient to go travelling with a lot of people, especially as they are all strangers to me. There will be several rules that you should follow. It is not romance and happy at all. Second, the tour guide often wants to have an abundant impression of all the people in the group. The places are arranged too much; in the end, there is always not enough time to spend in each place the group has been to. I could not remember or experience the environments where I only spent five minutes staying with them. I need more time and enjoy the difference between where I live and where I used to live. Last but not least, I have heard more than one time that people have the same impression of the same country they have been to. It is because the guide always takes people to the same place. For example, It is the same as the pictures of my friends and my parents which they took in France, only the faces are different. However, I want something more than all the people's experiences. To see the real things happening in foreign countries is more interesting than the photos on the post cards. In conclusion, it is not interesting at all if I can not decide where I want to go. The most interesting part of traveling is to study the country and decide where to go, and it would be better if there are some things unexpected happened. Going with a group is definitely one of my choices.","[""Although many people think that there is nothing to worry about while there is a guide. He would be responsible for all the needs they want.

1060,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"There have been a lot of events from the past in Korea : the Korean war, the invasion from Japan, many political incidents, and so on. That's why the older generation has gone through roughly in Korea. However, the young generation has no problem living within our country these days without thinking of many problems the older generation has had. There are some evidences that show why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. On a trip field, it is kind of boom for many young people in Korea to go to Europe for their travel recently. Not only Europe, but also many countries, such as the States, the U. K. , southern Asia, Latin America. The most important thing is that they go travelling with their money which is from their part-time job or their work. Whereas, there is no doubt that older people didn't usually go travelling abroad when they were younger. It's because they couldn't afford travelling abroad at that time, which doesn't mean that they didn't want to. Besides, development for flying abroad was not enough for them at that time. In other words, there were a few barriers for older people to travel abroad. As to the work as it concerned, while older people had to work 6 days a week from 9 a. m. to 8 p. m. , even more, the younger generation has ""working for 5 days a week from 9 to 5"" these days. They can even take a rest on Friday for some jobs. That's the reason why they can enjoy life on the weekends. They go shopping, go to a concert, go to a theatre, and go on a holiday.

1065,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am inclined to agree with the statement that people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful. I have certain reasons to agress with this statement which I will discuss later in my essays. I would also like to highlight the fact that taking such risks might not get the success in the 1st attempt, sometimes people need to attempt multiple times. The main reason for this my view is that I believe in the ""More risk, More gain"" philosophy. If I decide to get into some new business/idea, which nobody has tried, I need comparatively more resources in terms of money, time and effort to pursue this new venture. There is a chance that this new venture could fail, but on the positive note if that business/idea succeeds , I would have a tremendous potential to make money in this new business as I will not have much competition. I will give an example of John Chambers, CEO of a networking company. This company was traditionally in the business of selling networking devices. As its business became more mature and competition increased , John decided to take some risks and expanded into the telephony business and became successful in this new business. This company ranks as number one in telephone business. The 2nd reason for my view is that unless I venture into unknown territories I will not know what lies there. As a human, we always have this comfort zone which we do not want to leave but there is no guarantee that there is no risk in what we are doing today. My brother has a gift business and he was very comfortable in that business. I insisted him to try exporting business, though he was initially reluctant but he tried and became successful. In conclusion, I believe that risk taking is a shirt cut to success which we should try.","['I am inclined to agree with the statement that people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful.

If he prepares a particular lesson in the syllabus by mere mugging or learning the facts in the textbook without getting to understand the concept and the idea of what the lesson expresses ,it would be very difficult for him to pen down on his examination because one can basically only rely on memory. What if the student gets tense as soon as he sees the question about that particular portion. Being more anxious could result in palpitations and he may not put forth the answer. Instead if the student had just understood the idea and concept then it would have been easy for him to put forth and develop in his own words too which may actually be an expressive thought and eventually fetch him more marks. Take an other example of a research student. A research paper to be completed needs lots of information which should be compiled properly to meet the requirements of the research study. For this to happen, students try to gather a lot of information and materials,take notes,read. establish in mind how to put in orders needs lots of ideas. Only if he can understand the basic concept of that particular subject or paper can he develop new ideas which will fetch him good notes to complete a research paper eventually winning praise for his work which shows confidence. This will be very useful for the student if he is asked to deliver a paper presentation,because he has already understood the concept and the basic idea which has given him the confidence to express and deliver in a public gathering. Another example could also be taken which was proved, which isNewton's Law of Gravity. Just because Newton had the capacity to understand his topic to be invented his thought process welcomed the idea and thus the Law of Gravity was exposed to the world. If he had just learned the fact probably till now the law of fraud wouldnt have been in existence.","[""I personally agree with the statement that it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learning the facts because for a student getting to understand many facts is very important before applying them.

1075,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Responsibility plays a big role in our life, especially for older people. when a young child is having fun and he doesn't care about money, home and issues that happen to any person. Young people think that they still have good health but when they get older their health will start to go down. I agree with young people who want to have more fun than older people for a couple of reasons. First of all, responsibility as I mentioned in the beginning, makes any person think about how to make his life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do. For example in any family, the father always thinks about how to get money for his children, the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially. If we look at the children, we can notice that they want to play everyday and have fun without thinking about anything. That was a good example of showing the difference in how young and old people act. The second reason is that old people always start to take care of their health which absolutely goes down as they get older. On the other hand, young people think about no responsibility and no problems with their health, so why don't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future. For example, if someone is 60 years old and he is retired from his job, he could have health problems and refuse him to enjoy his life.","[""Responsibility plays a big role in our life, especially for older people. when a young child is having fun and he doesn't care about money, home and issues that happen to any person.

1080,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Traditionally, many people, including those who are going to advertise their own products, believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they are and this enhanced image from the advertisements helps to increase the sales of the products. However, my opinion is that this common sense does not always make sense. The chief reason for my view is that ill-manufactured advertisements could have bad effects on the product image or sales performances. If information about a certain product which a customer wants to know from the advertisement is not provided in the advertisement, most customers may forget the product after looking at the advertisements. Moreover, many advertisements could not succeed in focusing on the characteristics which the customer wants to catch in the advertisements. The other reason for my view is that core value or quality of product could not be invented even though most famous artists or advertisement agents manufacture the advertisement. Real value or real qualities could be diffused by other types of advertisements such as blogs on the internet, word of mouth, or articles in the newspapers or magazines. Some might argue that even though an advertisement could be ill-manufactured or create different effects expected, most advertising could create productive effects. But there are many examples that show how severe the effects the ill-manufactured advertisements had had. For example, a car manufacturer's advertisement puts a stress on more security-guaranteed facilities in a small car. But most prospective small car customers want to know how much the price of the new small car will be because most prospective customers will use that car as a second car and already strengthen big cars. In sum, I concur with the opinion that advertising could have good effects on the product's image or sales growth.","[""Traditionally, many people, including those who are going to advertise their own products, believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they are and this enhanced image from the advertisements helps to increase the sales of the products.

1082,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion successful people are more related to trying new things but they are not necessarily more attracted totaking risks.

Therefore they have responsibility for many employees who are working in the firm. For example when the boss of a company wants to develop a new, lets say, a new car. The car works with new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested well yet and will probably not make much money. In my opinion the business leader should not take the risk of developing the car until it has been well known in a country and has reached high interest. Because if it does not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employees would be unemployed. Nevertheless I think that successful people are more willing to try new things. They probably develop new things and also give impulses for the future. That means that they are pre- thinkers of future ideas. In spite of my opinion I could imagine that there are successful people who take risks. These people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care about the people who depend on their decisions.","['In my opinion successful people are more related to trying new things but they are not necessarily more attracted totaking risks.

1089,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that the means and ways of helping in a community have changed, but I totally disagree that young people do not give enough time to helping the community and society in general. A group of people coming together on a shared idea or opinion is called a community. Before the advent of the internet, people had to be physically present to be in the community, now it is not so. I think that with the exponential increase in which young users are releasing the benefits of the internet, there is a lot of time to create, expand and cherish the communities. Information age has given us more communities than there were any previously. If you just browse yahoo. com and orkut. com, you will find a community already present in which you are interested. Be it music, software, movies, entertainment, fund raising and so on. Young people not only create these communities but also make sure that they take active part in them by updating the latest and removing the rest. with the increasing number of users help is ensured to be given to the needed. Also, In today's world where people are living in high-rise buildings, I am sure every member of each house in the apartment will come together to form a committee, to atleast make sure that they know each other. when they come together they also find ways in which to solve each others' problems. Youngsters who care about society will make sure that community festivals are held with their utmost diligence. for example the Ganesh chaturiti festival in India, there are more young people than old ones and the festival is celebrated with full vigor and enthusiasm. In a typical college environment, there are many communities formed by young people who make sure that many weaker students get the necessary additional help that is needed. Communities can only exist if there is a shared interest, but now a days there are so many choices and as young minds change every now and then we think that they are not helping the community in which they have taken part.","[""I agree that the means and ways of helping in a community have changed, but I totally disagree that young people do not give enough time to helping the community and society in general. A group of people coming together on a shared idea or opinion is called a community. Before the advent of the internet, people had to be physically present to be in the community, now it is not so. I think that with the exponential increase in which young users are releasing the benefits of the internet, there is a lot of time to create, expand and cherish the communities. Information age has given us more communities than there were any previously. If you just browse yahoo. com and orkut. com, you will find a community already present in which you are interested. Be it music, software, movies, entertainment, fund raising and so on. Young people not only create these communities but also make sure that they take active part in them by updating the latest and removing the rest. with the increasing number of users help is ensured to be given to the needed. Also, In today's world where people are living in high-rise buildings, I am sure every member of each house in the apartment will come together to form a committee, to atleast make sure that they know each other. when they come together they also find ways in which to solve each others' problems. Youngsters who care about society will make sure that community festivals are held with their utmost diligence. for example the Ganesh chaturiti festival in India, there are more young people than old ones and the festival is celebrated with full vigor and enthusiasm.

1090,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do not agree that Young people enjoy life more than older people do. I can not support this idea for two interesting reasons. First of all, young people have less free time than old people do. Think about the development stages of a human life chronically. When they are students, every day is full of something to do mandatarily such as homework, tutorials, lessons. Also young parents are so hectic almost everyday earning money, working house chores, taking care of children and being social to survive the difficulties which come into their lives. Just during the holidays they can relax and enjoy some time, then they have to struggle again after those certain times. It is hard even to think of themselves and their lives for a short time. On the contrary, old folks are quite often seen taking a walk, reading substantial books, playing golf, cruising on a beautiful ship and so on. Second, young people have less money than old people do. Actually young group makes a lot more money than the other one.","['I do not agree that Young people enjoy life more than older people do.

Having broad knowledge of many subjects is better than having knowledge in one subject. Because, every subject in the academic year is related to the other subjects. As we know, MATHEMATICS is the father of all subjects. It has a major influence on all other subjects. There is no such subject which does not have an influence on it. having a knowledge of it only one can have the knowledge of the other subjects completely. For example, in our Bachelor's degree, we have the subjects MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS and WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS. Each have the influence on the other.

1117,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities, because they have time to help their communities. But I do not think so. I have some reasons for this. Firstly, young people are too busy and selfish. Their time is occupied by their schedule. For example, in Japan, my country, the number of people going to schools has been increasing at a high speed, because the quantity of things for teaching public schools in Japan has been cut. In their school, they cannot learn enough knowledge. Moreover, many young people are always playing with their friends or are always staying at home despite not having anything to do. For those reasons, I think, they do not want/can not help. Secondly, recently, the opportunity for having relationships in their communities is decreasing. In particular, in urban areas, the connection between people is very weak. For instance, my friend has never participated in events of her communities, such as a Japanese festival, instead of only seeing them. My home town is suburban. So I often take part in Japanese festivals. Of course, all members of my family do, also, at the least half of the population of my town do, too.

They think that they should respect their elders and should not hurt their feelings in any way. On the other hand,older people need not respect their younger ones and have the right to behave as they wish.","['I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people.

1144,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Mankind always needs education therefore education is a very important aspect of human life to reach high life standards. Ideas and concepts are the most important part of education. Some assumed that it is the most important for students to understand ideas and concepts in contradiction to this some think that the best for the students to learn facts. I totally agree with the first idea. These are the following reasons. The first reason for my belief is that,the students must learn the ideas first. Because the ideas are important and also the concepts. Students must pay attention to the ideas and concepts rather than the facts. If students learn the ideas and the concepts the student can learn the facts by time. The second reason for my belief is that,the facts are not important exactly. Because the ideas make the shape to the facts. So its concept is important so it is related to the ideas. If the student learns the ideas first he or she can prepare the facts before and he or she can look at the facts in different ways. This is the important thing. On the other hand the facts are important some times to look at the objects truely.","['Mankind always needs education therefore education is a very important aspect of human life to reach high life standards.

Furthermore life becomes faster and that is why everybody, not only young people, has to think better about how and why they do the things they do and if it is the best they can do. Besides that it differs from age, religion and place in society how active or passive young people are in their communities.

If they are happy with the world around them the help of young people is logical, but if they have no friends and fun at work it is logical that they are not willing to help the community and prefer to sit in their room next to the computer or television. Besides that the government could try to make help and work of young people more public, so that young people can see, that they can help and perhaps can have a better feeling throughout that, what they have done. For me it would be important to show which goals young people can achieve.

First of all,when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel,you can only see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group. You can not find out around the city. Everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide. For example,you want to see the other side of the city,but there is a certain travel program which includes seeing certain places in the city. You have to follow the travel program. Secondly,People who are from that city can understand that you are a tourist. This system has some difficulties. They can cheat on you or sell kind of present things to you much more expensively. For example,when you go to a store for shopping,if they understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist they can try to sell many things much more expensive,but if you travel alone and you can speak the language of that country which you want to see they can not understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist. So people who are from that country or that city can sell things to you for the original price. Third of all, traveling with groups is not an expensive activity but it is also very dangerous. There are many terrorist people or groups who want to kidnap tourists and foreign people to come true their bad purposes. Those kinds of people can realize that you are a tourist,because you are travelling with the group and following the tour guide. They can kidnap you and kill you. Furthermore they can use you for their purposes. That situation happened with tourists many times. Those people killed the tourists or got money from the tourists of the family.', 'In the above,there are many advantages to traveling alone and following the tour guide.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
1159,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do not agree that life is more enjoyable for young people than for elderly people. It is not a fact which is proved scientifically that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As for me, when you get older you will learn what kind of facilities and activities make you happy or unhappy. Because of experiencing more than younger  people, being older has lots of advantages. Firstly, young people are more interested in trying new things. But it is not sure that they will enjoy what they do. They will experience an action to learn something. Sometimes this can lead young people to be unhappier than before. On the other hand, when you become older, I am sure that you will be more clear about new things. Moreover, when somebody gets older, he or she generally becomes what sort of actions change the mood positively. As a result of these experiences, old people get a better time though they have fewer times to live than young people have. Secondly, the ages lived teach people to be more patient. That is why older people tend to insist on doing something even though they were very unsuccessful at it before.","['I do not agree that life is more enjoyable for young people than for elderly people.

1163,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Here are three reasons to support my agreement. The first reason is that the idea is the most important one of everything. Only when you know the main idea about it, can you think about more details and ask more questions. Furthermore, the concepts are the main body of the lesson or something like that. You should understand the concepts and after that you can learn other information. For example, if a student can't understand the idea and concepts of the chapter in accountingclass, he doesn't know what this chapter istalking about. Then, he gained nothing on accounting class. The worst thing is that he will fail the course. The second reason is that understanding is more basic than learning. You can learn something after your understanding. For instance, in order to learn how to read, you should understand what reading means. It means you should see the words in the paper and say them. Therefore,you must gain the idea and concepts of reading. After understanding those, you can learn other things such as different kinds of reading methods and how to read. Moreover, when people are talking about reading, the first thing that appears in your brain is the meaning of reading. It is the basic one. The third reason is that ideas and concepts are always put in front of the book such as an outline. You can know what the author mainly mentions in the book because of the ideas and concepts. Then, you can read the book from the first page to the end and learn the details and facts. Generally speaking, it is normal when you read books and learn them. On the whole, you can't learn the details and facts without having known about the ideas and concepts. It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Sometimes, it is enough for them to know ideas and concepts.

1169,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I think being specialised in one specific subject is good, but is not enough for your personal development. First of all, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is better to improve your communication with people. I mean, if your knowledge is really broad,you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of different subjects with a lot of different people. Being open minded in your knowledge leads you, most of the time, to being open minded socially. It is important to be interested in several things, that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations, and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point; whatever you actually want to do in life. Furthermore, the more you learn, the more you want to learn (and need to learn actually). The desire to learn can be found if you are specializing in one specific subject, but a single subject may lead you to isolate yourself in technical considerations that no one can actually understand, whereas plurality of subjects makes your mind breathe. It is no longer a question of 'academic"" knowledge, it is a question of curiosity. According to me, acknowledgement goes the same way as it goes for food, that is to say if you eat the same food everyday, you will just be quickly disgusted. Therefore, if you just study one single subject, even if you go deeply through it, you will be disgusted one day somewhat. To summarize, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can thus talk about more things, and it makes you so curious as if you were majoring in one specific subject.","['I think being specialised in one specific subject is good, but is not enough for your personal development.

So the increase in cars can be considered like an obvious result of modern society. But if we think about the future further there may be a completely different situation waiting for us. There are some elements able to limit the car's increase in future. First of all, the development of telecommunication will definitely decrease the need to move. All texts, data,graphics or even sound elements can be transported by the internet so we won't need to move out to get our office to work. Payment is also getting informatised because we are using credit cards and telebanking systems. All the concepts of our life are becoming non-material and they exist just on the internet's web. Decreasing of transport of materials will reduce the number of cars as a means of transport. These days there aren't many private airplanes but in the future airplanes or another system will replace cars. Technology is very fast changing and progressing. Cars will be one of the materials of the last days we won't use anymore. Soon there will be another system which can fill the lack that a car couldn't complete or who can solve problems that a car was provoking like pollution or accidents. The main reason that I suppose the number of cars has decreased is there are a lot of problems caused by cars. Most people die because of car accidents rather than illness. Certainly there will be another way of transportation that human beings will find out."", 'Nowadays cars are definitely increasing all over the world.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

1174,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,Knowledge is an important thing for a person's life. According to many people; specializing in one specific topic provides them with several opportunities to express a subject but i strongly believe that having broad knowledge is more advantageous. You can work on many topics; you can demonstrate your knowledge to others and you can improve yourself; First of all; if you are familiar with some kinds of topic; you can easily predict the subject and understand the mainstream. And also you can give a speech about the topic eventhough you dont know everything about thesubject. Secondly academic subjects are related to each other so you can find the transitions and you can realize the connections between the subjects.

1191,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts because without them they will never understand the facts. I can explain it much better with an example:if you understand the concept of gravity you can understand why we can' t fly, but if you only know the fact that we can't fly you don't know the concept of gravity. You can understand that there is something more but without some further facts you can' t find the concept. But at the same time facts are very important for a student. We live in a society that forgets the past in a very easy way, the more we go on the more we forget and school is not good at giving us the information. I also know it is difficult to give us all the information because there is so little time but the few arguments that they have chosen for us are not enough. In Italian schools, for example, we study for many years the Preistoric period, the Acient, the Middle age. The Story! But when we finally arrive at study, at the latest year of school, the recent story of the world and of our country we run and at least we arrive at the first period after the Second World War; now we are in 2007 and there are fifty years of facts that we don' t know well and for this we have a not culturate class of people that will govern us. This is only an example to show how facts, in my opinion, are much more important to understand than ideas and concepts also because if you learn much better the facts, from them, you will recognize also the ideas and concepts that are unified to them.","[""In my opinion it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts because without them they will never understand the facts.

They have to seek an opportunity to speak to a new person, and get to know each other. Although, parents, who have already gained a friend, do not need to make new friends. They do not need to experience those stressful times any more. To give a more considerable instance, my mother enjoys more of her life after my entrance to university.

Specialising in something you can give to your research a peculiar prospect and then increase your field of study. Let me give us some examples based on my experience as an anthropologist. I think they could clearly illustrate what I mean. During my anthropological field work in Cameroon, West Africa, I argued that there were lots of interesting aspects of this African society ( for example kinship, economic or religious systems etc. ). However I Decided to focus my research on witchcraft and sorcery. Observing life in a small village I saw that I could note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric. The occult power was used in a social and economic level. Moreover when I wrote my BA`s thesis I used a specific prospective and a peculiar method of analysis. I used the post-modern prospective on hidden cults of japanese Christians and i demonstrated how these hidden cults influenced the modern japanese Christians and other religious movements. I tried to explain just one aspect of African or Japanese society and I tried to explain how these particular aspects reflected on the whole society in different levels.

And they would rather give enough time to dedicate to helping their communities. On the other hand,some people show less concern towards helping their communities. Perhaps they would be rather busy with their day-to-day activities. They would be more self-centred and they would never even bother about helping their communities. It is not necessary for younger people to dedicate much of the time helping their communities,infact a small amount of help can help much better. Sideways people with positive views towards developing a community are more concerned about helping their communities and dedicate their sufficient work to helping them make their communities better. They will organise more effective programs to help their communities. They will arrange more and more effective plans to take their communities in a straight way. The young people should be motivated to help their communities and effective programs should be implemented to motivate people. Moreover some or more young people are more than enough for a community to develop. However the formation of communities helps most things to grow in a straight way. It will also give suggestions to most of the problems. Communities should be developed in such a way that they should drive the people's attention towards them. They can do this by organizing some cultural activities on some occasions. By doing so, most young people will be motivated to help their communities.

I agree with this statement. There are several reasons for this. One does not have to waste time learning facts and also experience can help students to learn facts. Just understanding the idea and concept can also help to be more creative. It is a waste of time giving students everything about the topic. They need to run their own brains to understand what the whole lecture is about. For example in an art class, the teacher wants students to create a new tool for thekitchen. He gives the idea about what he wants but if he gives the facts they do not have to search for anything to increase their knowledge and ability as well. They can not look from a different perspective. Experience is one of the most important points to learn something. For instance, you studied for your lesson and you got your driving licence. Without having experience of how you expect to drive as well as the others can. Experience is more important than learning facts. You give the idea and concept. Afterwards they experience it in real life by facing them. Being flexible in our creations depends on how free we are. Just having ideas can help you be more creative. In order to think well, sometimes we should learn facts by searching for them. In conclusion, trying to learn facts is a kind of waste of time and without experiencing the concepts we learn do not help us to improve ourselves.

A person who wants to have an academic career should be aware of a lot of academic issues. However specialization makes people more successful and unconfused. So I do disagree with the statement. First of all, it is obvious that people who have academic careers, should have a broad knowledge of not only academic subjects but also global issues around them. However specialization is necessary for the academic periphery. Let us imagine a professor; when a student asks some general questions about his or her research project, he can answer them but if the student asks some specific questions, the professor can not be satisfied with details. The brain has a capacity for knowledge. If a human behaviour focus on a lot of issues, he or she can be aware of many more things but can not know anything in detail. Secondly, when we look at developing countries, we see that specialization is the main point in this development process. People do what they know best. Without argument it is clear that intellectual knowledge is important in social life and benefits people to have a vision of life. However, in the academic career specialization makes people successful. People have a perception capacity. Therefore people should choose subjects which are in their perception of an academic career. In conclusion, all of those reasons show that a person who wants to succeed in his or her academic career, should specialize in some subjects. The academician can be confused by the other option. People should do their best in their working life. Making the best happens only if specialization happens.

1219,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"In my opinion, traveling the world with a group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money. First of all, while they give you time to explore places, it's a very short time, so you miss out on lots of things that are necessary. Secondly, crashing a bus that drives for hours and hours without knowing anybody or anywhere just isn't a fun thing to do. Finally, some tour guides don't even know what they are talking about, and don't talk when they are supposed to, so you have to take risks on picking the right time and date. Let's say that you went to an University of Harvard, and they have lots to see like the science center, and famous people who graduated from that place like Bill Gates. So the tour guides tell you to explore places within half an hour which is a very short period of time in such a large place. So while you are looking at unnecessary things, time goes by, and you miss out on the important things like the golden statue. Also if you don't make it in time for the bus, they all complain about waiting for you eventhough it is just for a minute. Eventhough, you go to places with your family or friends, they have lots of other people on the bus who are traveling with you. You could get bored only by talking to your family members or your friends. But some people don't care, because they also have TV's on the bus to entertain you, but it only entertains me a bit. Then all you hear is chattering going on and on beside you and infront of you. You can't tell them to be quiet, because they will point fingers at you and even curse you. The other thing is that if you want to sleep, and lean back your chair a bit, they complain to you about how uncomfortable it is which is very annoying. The Great Wall of China. It has lots of history and legends to it. Surely, people want to know about it, but the tour guide doesn't even say a word about it, and even if he talks aloud, he doesn't know what he is saying. Well i am not saying that every tour guide acts like that, but if you pick the wrong time and date, you will have to face the consequences. Therefore, i disagree with the statement. First of all, the tour guide doesn't give you the right timing for you to explore the place. Secondly, you barely know anybody on the bus except for people who came with you, and finally the tour guide would stink if you picked the wrong bus.","[""In my opinion, traveling the world with a group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money.

1221,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people keep enjoying, sometimes indulging, their youth. They believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. So they have to consume their limited youth for enjoyment. I have to say such an idea is inappropriate since enjoying life is not a priority for young people. There are many types of enjoying your life, no matter whether you are young or older. Everyone, at any age, can find his or her way of enjoyment. Young people are physically energetic so that they can climb mountains, play Internet games, play basketball and do disco dances. Older people can travel in more peaceful ways like on a cruiser, playing chess and gathering to watch basketball matches. Some enjoyments are just mission impossible for young people in the sake of age.","['Some people keep enjoying, sometimes indulging, their youth.

1222,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. When I was a high school student, I usually learned just facts. It was a system of korean education. For example, in math class, I could learn a lot of information in a short period. However, I usually got low grades in each test. Because the teacher changed the style of problems in each test, I could not use such factors which I learned before. That's why I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important. Next, if I understand ideas and concepts of problems, I can use them in our lives. For instance, I learned the effective value of electronic products through my physics class. Therefore, I can save on utility fees because I can find which products are more effective than others in the home. Finally, if we knew about concepts and ideas of some accidents, unfortunate accidents would never happen in the future. For example, if we just know factors of invasion from other counties, the invasions would be faced again because we did not know how to prepare them.","[""I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

1243,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement. First of all,every body agrees that successful people are not ordinary people. Because they've found a way to get richness and success while others are still stay poor in either their money or their futures. Successful people usually think differently. For instance,an average person who makes about 50 thousand dollars a year would probably save 10 to 20 thousand dollars in their bank accounts. What a successful person would do is use the money to invest other than put that much money into a bank. That's how a small amount of money gets larger and larger. Successful people think things in advance. They look at the market and they will know what hot deals are going on. They would find out which you can and which you cannot do. They would figure out which worthes the risk to invest in. In other words ,they have the intelligence to distinguish good stuff from bad stuff. Any way,successful people are usually businessmen. My friend John is a stock bloker who works on wall Street. He makes money only out of looking at how the stock goes. He usually works at home, and seldom goes out. But he knows every thing. He gets information from the internet. He's just more intelligent. Once he knows what the stock will go for,he knows for sure.","[""I agree with the statement.

Second, especially recently, young people such as university students tend to live by themselves. Actually, most of my friends live apart from their family.

1259,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays, there are some kinds of ways to learn something which have never been done before in personal life. I disagree with the statement that it is more effective to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. People should face the facts about what would be more Important things. First of all, there is no doubt about the fact that facts are composed of real things. Most of them have records or certifications in several ways, writing, taking photos, painting, or existing substance itself like a fossil. There are obvious no assumptions and personal opinions in the facts. Besides, facts would not change their form because they can not be made by human thoughts. For example, the earth exists in the solar system, it is a fact. But some people had ideas the earth was just existing on its own, no system, in the ancient world. Second, ideas and concepts are based on facts. If there are no facts, ideas and concepts can not be born. People tend to add to some thoughts in their own way on the fundamental, facts. In the other words, facts bring human thoughts, ideas and concepts. In conclusion, facts have some more advantages for the study than ideas and concepts that I have shown above. There is no possibility of existence without ideas and concepts.","['Nowadays, there are some kinds of ways to learn something which have never been done before in personal life.

We can exchange information together by all kinds of communication systems such as the internet and mass media. Even though we purchase one item, we try to get information about all resources.

I think only the development of new ways and new technologies can make you successful for a long time and that is what they want to have. Success for the rest of their lives.

For good and successful work you have to enjoy it and if it is boring you can not even enjoy it. Another reason for taking risks is that the people may not lose their jobs when they are unsuccessful. That gives them the possibility to improve new procedures. Probably the fact of being restless and of taking risks is the key to being successful.

1274,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Generally people who are successful take risks that other people might be frightened of. It is not easy to make a decision to take risks; however, there is a massive chance of being successful after dealing with the risks. There are some advantages to taking risks when people do business. First of all, there is your own opportunity to succeed. If you operate a business with an initiated item, there is only success or failure. When a person thinks that the item that he/she has is exotic, other people might think it is, or not. If you read other people's minds and invent an item that other people couldn't think of, then your company will be the necessary or need other people. Secondly, people who take risks, they can save a lot of time. As an example of the most successful person in the world, Bill Gates, he quit the college where he studied. After all, he invented DOS and Windows with his friends and coworkers, he became the richest man in the world at a very young age. Therefore, taking risks could make a person become successful even though he/she doesn't have a school grade. Finally, taking risks not just makes you rich, but it also makes you facmous and helpful to other people. Most successful people who take risks are famous and other people need them. Being rich with business that other people also do may not be too difficult to attain, but being famous and being needed by other people is not easy to achieve. In conclusion, people are afraid to take risks, but it is a chance to be more successful than other people. With the advantages above, it is clear that dealing with risks has more chance of success than doing what other people do. Taking risks could destroy people's lives; however, if you are born into this competitive world, isn't it valuable to take risks if you can succeed?.","[""Generally people who are successful take risks that other people might be frightened of.

Being rich with business that other people also do may not be too difficult to attain, but being famous and being needed by other people is not easy to achieve.

1290,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"This is a very hard discussed question and I believe everybody you ask tells you a different answer about this aspect of the generation gap. But with the tendency that always the other group is accused of being more enjoyable than the one you belong to. So everybody's opinion as a young or older person could be affected by such an influence. Thus I am trying not to be affected by such group thinking. I would say the majority of our society is enjoying their life, although older people do it more. Surely one could say the young are lazy and the only thing they have in mind is making a party. But I think that relates to their younger and more active body and mind. And I am convinced the relatively short time young people party cannot be compared to the long periods the older people sit around watching tv, playing poker, or spending their free time in female chatting clubs. Of course there may be several older people that use their time efficiently by working, keeping the front yard nice or being active in a sports club. There are also people who are ill and cannot do what they have in mind. But in summary I want to make a statement about the mean, the normal, older person. Young people are simply doing much more, in both fields enjoying and working, than older people.","[""This is a very hard discussed question and I believe everybody you ask tells you a different answer about this aspect of the generation gap.

1291,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"There are some differences between young people and older people. I want to explain important points about their characteristics. First, young people are more active because they have to go to school, they have to learn what their requirements  are. They also have to grow to become what they want to be. Though, they are growing up, there are a lot of struggles that they have to face. They are confused and lost because they can not see what is going to happen next. Second, think about older people who are calmer and have knowledge, and go done with their development. They can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school. They may have time to think about their grand children who they got. But there are things that they can not do which is going to school, playing sports beyond their average , being expert at some new thing. So some limits come up to them because their age is increasing. But it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do. For example, if you want to have your own time to relax, sleep, talk with friends, it seems like young people have time for those kinds of things, but young people may not do it because there are a lot of things to do like home work, sports club, planning for university or job. But older people may do it because they have time, maybe they are having a job that they really want to do. School work is hard to have fun, there is such a limited time, they are still struggling with everything. Older people can enjoy what young people enjoy, if they want to play sports as much as young people do then they can do it.","['There are some differences between young people and older people.

Knowing how much money companies are willing to spend in an advertisement I have to say it must work. Now there are some more reasonable ways of responding to the question. We could talk about packaging forinstance. Between products that offer the same thing, that are at the same price, I would rather choose the best looking one. For me the product aspect reflects its real quality. In this case the true problem is comparison. I don't think you make a product seem better than it really is, the point is making the product seem better than the other products ! I think this is really working. There is another way of advertising a product : getting the buyer to know the product before he even gets to buy it : advertising in magazines and  on television. In my opinion, this may be more efficient because the buyer won't necessarily compare the product to the other ones. He will just get in the store and search for that exact product because he has been told it is the best. In this case it is true that advertising is used to make the product seem better than it really is.","[""Advertisements have been increasing a lot during the last 30 years.

1295,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"There are people who support the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and others do not support this idea. I would say that I agree with this idea that most advertisers make products seem much better. In the following discussion, I would like to explain the reason with some examples. Firstly, in Japan, I have heard news that some people have died because of using to reduce weight pills. Recently, over weight problems have got bigger in Japan too. Many people want to reduce their weight in an easy way. This company imported this pill from another country and advertised it all over the country. It says that some people could lose 5 kg in two weeks or less than a week. Many people bought it and some of them had really terrible results. I am not sure that pill was the main cause of their death, but I had heard that it works to blood pressure. So some of them affected badly. Secondly, I like to go to restaurants or bars. I can choose from several kinds of foods from the menu. I decided on foods, because they look so delicious and they also have a great range of good prices. However, when I see the real one, sometimes I am disappointed. These foods are totally different from the menu, for example, the amount of food, taste and price. Whenever I see it, I decide I will not come here again. I understand companies need to have more profits from their products. They have to make people want to buy them. The advertisement plays an important part in their profit. However, if they show their product much better than reality, they will lose their trust from not only customers but also their company accounts. And they also lose their position in their field. Finally, I would say that the advertisements should not make products seem much better than they really are. Companies do their business in an honest way.","['There are people who support the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and others do not support this idea.

They can also see the trend of life therefore they can prepare for the change of life and try new things that may lead them to success.

How can we enjoy this life and be happy? Everyone knows that life is not easy and it needs lots of work to be a successful person in it. There are two groups of people who can enjoy this life, such as young people and older people. First, young people can enjoy life in different ways. For example, they can do many things in this life without any responsibility for what they are doing because they know that the responsibility is carried by their parents. Also, they can do a lot of things that older people can't do as a result of health. Young people can do a lot of activities in one day , but older people can't do that.

The logic provides these points in a very clear way. Old people had already taken their time to enjoy this life when they were young. So they have to give the chance for the other generation to enjoy their own life. Finally, in my opinion, young people are the right people to enjoy this life.

All this knowledge that you get in all this time makes your life much different than those that never take the chance to go. That is why people who take the chance to do it,must have an open mind to understand ideas, concepts and obviously to learn the facts of any information. When you are talking about topics like children, you must learn about everything, food, games, sickness, parents etc. so this is the idea, ""children"", but you must learn about concepts, like what is common in them, what is terrible, what is normal in their behaviour, how to treat them, how to talk to them, how to play with them, and when you find all this information and understand it, it will be much easier to do everything with them, so this last part will be the Facts. For example, to coach children skaters you must know first how to skate, then how to teach children , and with all this information you must know how to apply your knowledge tochildren, and during this time you will find that every single kid is different and you have to treat everyone differently. To sum up this subject I must say that any student that is taking any class at school has to memorize, understand different ideas, different concepts and of course to learn facts,to have an open mind and in this way to learn all the information that you are receiving, this is the order in an normal and objective way to learn.

Another side of the same coin is the recent economic  situation. The value of the firms only depends on their success at the stock fairs. As a result the managers are trained to push these courses and they don't care about their employees (it's not a risky behaviour, because everyone does it). In this case success is a question of the definition. But there is another way to succeed too. Doing continuously the work you know how to do well will give you a smaller but steady flow of success.

1310,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people take risks rather than doing only what they know. Successful people do take risks as they want to escape from the ordinary life. I do not call myself a very successful person, but I once took a risk and my life has been better.

Henry Ford, the father of the car, once was an expert on watch repair. He worked as one to earn his room rent and to study mechanics. Then he thought about transportation and invented cars. Next, the success is equal to the riskyness. Which means that when you have a high probability of failure, then you have a high reward when you succeed. I am in middle school grade three, since grade two, I have liked a girl. She is in the same school and I still like her. I wanted to say that I like her, but I got too shy when I stood in front of her. When I said that, I felt like falling down an endless cliff that I could never come up again, but when she laughed, said nothing and looked at me, I felt like a mattress holding me from the cliff, so I like her, and she knows that I like her. Lastly, risks are sometimes making something new or re-designing some products. Edison, the king of invention, once tried to hatch an egg, and did not go to school when he was in elementary school. His mother taught him. When he was grown up, he made a telephone which was already made by Alexander Graham Bell.","['I agree with the statement that successful people take risks rather than doing only what they know.

1314,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people. Enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people of all ages. There are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other, all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurrence. Both younger people as well as older people have problems to face in life. Each age group's enjoyment is curbed because of these problems, but the enjoyment is never far away. Lets take the example of a young boy. He does not enjoy it when he has to give exams, study, or go to school. However, he enjoys it when he goes to play, or when he watches television. In the same way an adult (middle aged) does not enjoy going to work, or working around his or her house. But they do enjoy it when they come back from work, when they are on a holiday, or when they go to a party. In the case of old people as well, they enjoy it as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds. But they face problems regarding their health. So this way every age group has its own share of enjoyment and problems. We cannot draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or less as there are various factors such as time and society which decide that. Along with this there is also the fact that one's enjoyment can be another's problem. In contrast, children enjoy playing more and studying less. The adults (parents) have problems with that, which curbs their enjoyment of seeing their child study. When the child is forcefully made to study, then the parents' enjoyment becomes the child's problem. In the case of old people, their enjoyment is that they do not need to work.","[""I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people.

1321,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","What will our planet look like in twenty years? This question is in all the conversations about the consequences of what we are doing today. Will it look better or worse? It's not a debate today but one of the interrogations concerns the use of cars, which are becoming more and more accurate all over the world. On the one hand, we might think that the number of cars will progress significantly in the years to come, thanks to economic progress and innovations in technology. More and more countries nowadays use cars : in China, for example, the car industry is in great development, and as there are really many inhabitants, we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive markets in a few years. But on the other hand, we may add that considerations about environmental protection are taking more and more importance, Sustainable development is a recurrent term in speeches and official documents, more especially, of course, in developed countries, which had already known the excitement of car technology and had also already benefited from its advantages. So the point now is to find solutions to limit the damage to cars to the environment, such as the recent alternatives that are developing in France today. In big cities, the public power is making big ad campaigns in order to attract people to use public transport [bus, metro. ] or to use a bike.

This question is in all the conversations about the consequences of what we are doing today. Will it look better or worse? It's not a debate today but one of the interrogations concerns the use of cars, which are becoming more and more accurate all over the world. On the one hand, we might think that the number of cars will progress significantly in the years to come, thanks to economic progress and innovations in technology. More and more countries nowadays use cars : in China, for example, the car industry is in great development, and as there are really many inhabitants, we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive markets in a few years. But on the other hand, we may add that considerations about environmental protection are taking more and more importance, Sustainable development is a recurrent term in speeches and official documents, more especially, of course, in developed countries, which had already known the excitement of car technology and had also already benefited from its advantages. So the point now is to find solutions to limit the damage to cars to the environment, such as the recent alternatives that are developing in France today.

My instant reply is no, and mainly because I realize how our technology is rapidly advancing, and cars will change, changing only to make people love them more, satisfying urges for beautiful car models, creating more desires to own one. Looking back into the past since cars were first invented, there's a huge big difference in how much cars are owned. Compared to before when only the rich ownedcars, cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price, considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one. As time passes, the rich will continue to buy more cars and sell their old ones, and at the same time, the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price. With this cycle going on, more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them. And why are the rich buying more and more cars? Generally it's because of the constant change in car technology; the desire for speed and unique designs. A stereotype view of rich people is people who buy cars just because of their looks.

1332,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do. 'There were two main reasons for agreeing with this statement. They were 'variation of choice' and 'passionate'. For the first reason, young people can have more choice than older people do. Usually older people have less opportunities than young people have because of their age and also they have worse health than young people do. Also when older people get hurt, they recover slower than young people do becauseolder people 's cells are too old to reproduce themselves. This has caused older people's choices to become limited. For example, oldies cannot ride a ski or snowboard as young people do dangerous tricks because they have more risk than young riders have. The second reason is related to passion. Young people usually have more passion than old people do. For this reason, it is because of hormones and the different amount of experience. Old people have less hormones than young people have and hormones are one of the scientific catalysts that make the brain excited. As a result of this, even if young and old people do the same situation, their excitement is different because of the amount of hormones. For passionate people, the amount of experience also affects a lot. Usually a beginner has more excitement than a veteran does. For example, when two different types of people have the same girl friend, the amount of excitement is different between a lady and a guy who never had a girlfriend because a lady's guy already has experience of having a girl friend. This relationship does not change a lot between old people and young people because old people usually have more experience than young people have.","[""I agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do.

The situation is just for my country. If we think about all the countries in the world, the number of cars is horrible. In China most people use bicyclesoutside. But they are alone. Even if the number of cars in use is increasing. If only all people in the world did that. If they did, the roads would be very quiet and also the atmosphere would be cleaner. But if we look at today it is impossible that there will be fewer cars in use. Unlike today the number of cars in use will have increased so much that we will not walk on the streets. If it continues like this it will damage the environment ,too. We are damaging the whole world and in twenty years we will not find anywhere to live. Using cars also causes a decrease in petrol prices. We are consuming so much petrol that it will not be enough.

Therefore, I completely agree with the opinion that says people who try new things are able to be more successful. In our life, getting risk is a fundamental part of our world. No one can expect what could happen to him or her. So, I think it is worth it to try new things, use new media, or meet new people. Many successful people built their successful on a moment that they were born. For example, the famous actor ""Arnold"", he can be just like any other actor , but he decided to engage in the political world and now, he is the governor of California State. I consider his decision to be a bold and smart decision because after a few years he would loosen his ability to be good and attractive actor because of his age.","['Usually, people are familiar with what they used to do.

For example if you need to shop you have to be worried about the feelings of your group, but it's easier when you travel with a friend or a member of your family to change the schedule of your journey. Secondly, all of your movements during the trip are restricted because you are in a group. For instance, if you have a plan to enjoy eating in a different restaurant, if you will meet many new people, it's not possible to do this in a group because during the trip you are always with your group, so you don't have the time to meet someone and the travel can be boring. Finally, if you travel with a guide you are not able to quit the group and to do what you want to do. You have to follow the instruction of the tour guide it's like travel information that's not good.
