1131172.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Before presenting my point of view, I think it is necessary for me to examine the question carefully. Which one is more important, learning the particular facts or acquiring the concepts and general principles. It is a matter of balancing the pros and cons of these methods, the decision, therefore, is not easy to make. In my opinion, ideas and principle concepts are more important. the first and foremost reason in support of my position is that it is impossible for us to learn every fact during our limited lifetime. Take mathematics as an example, we could not do all the measurements for the three lenths of every triangle and it is easy to make some mistakes. However, we could just calculate the length precisely and quickly by using the principle. Another compelling fact in favor of my position is that facts are often too specific and not convincing and we learn little from particular facts. A striking example is that many fevers can be healed by Keli. Although in some clinical cases it would result in some side effects, we could not deny that it is not a good medicine just by observing such a specific ""fact"". I cite this extreme example merely in an attempt to demonstrate that we would make false decisions by observing some specific facts.

Because cars are one of the biggest problems with pollution's creation that damage our environment, it will be forbidden in the next future to drive cars. Pollution destroys our Earth and kills about 100 species of animals everyday. Moreover, the climate on the Earth changes dramatically, as a result, our flora and fauna are destroyed. Here are some reasons that show that in twenty years, cars won't exist anymore, because of this problem of pollution creation. Another reason is that before twenty years, new methods of transportation will be invented. As stated in the first paragraph, cars produce too much pollution.","In fact, some people will create a revolutionary method of transportation with an engine carrying water or sunlight, instead of gas.",-1.0,,,,,,,1.0,"In fact, some people will create a revolutionary method of transportation with an engine using water or sunlight, instead of gas.","In fact, some people will develop revolutionary methods of transportation that use water or sunlight as fuel instead of gas."

1881363.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There is an argument regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Personally, I agree with the statement for the following reasons. First, broad knowledge will discover one's potential talents. Also, it leads people to grow deeply from many aspects. First and foremost, knowledge from a variety of fields will help people to find potential talents. In today's society, many schools offer as many subjects as possible for the students. That is largely because there are plenty of people who have not known what they want to be. In this case, broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a good experience for the person's future. they can learn a variety of subjects and choose their major from them. To be specific, my brother always dreamed of being a dentist however after he experienced many academic subjects, he realized that he has more talents in astronomy rather than in dentistry. It turns out, he enjoys his job and always tells me that ""people should learn from a variety of subjects to discover what they really want"". Therefore, knowledge from diverse areas is crucial for developing one's talents What is more, broad knowledge allows people to grow into more desirable people. Thesedays, it is common sense that being a specialist in one area is the key tosuccess. However, those people who are successful are not appropriate. Although they finalcially succeed, many specialists have problems with some issues that they do not major  in. According to a recently released survey by the Korean national research center, more than 40 percent of specialists have a problem with socialization.",the research shows that these people tend to self-esteem due to their notion that they are much better than others.,-1.0,,1.0,,,,,,the research shows that these people tend to have high self-esteem due to their notion that they are much better than others.,The research shows that these people tend to have lower self-esteem due to their notion that they are much better than others.

With ever evolving technology at hand today, the world has become much more connected, unlike in the olden days, people now need cars for many reasons such as commuting to work or visiting relatives of friends living far away.

Cars are also very easy to use and can take the driver to any destination he or she desires. Currently with the increasing competition between companies, car prices have fluctuated. These effective vehicles can take you anywhere at any time, unlike trains, buses and other public transport systems which have defined scheduals and destinations.

Laundry is as clean as it has been 10 years ago, isn't it. It's absolutely the same procedure. Moreover the variety of products increasesdramatically. It's hard to keep a realistic overview when you go through the shelves in a grocery store for example. All the so-called improved recipes of e. g. yogurts. With colourful wrappings and slogans on it. Does the most appealing advertisement really confirm a better and healthier dessert? I think the answer is no. Last but not least, an incredible competition takes place in the western markets. Everyone knows it. The most offered products particularly according to our daily use are available at a sufficient quantity and - relevant in this context - at anoutstanding quality. How can suppliers capture and enhance customers' attention? Logically producers are forced to emphasize the experience and description of their supply to attrack people's demand.

1766936.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The issue at hand is whether students should concentrate on understanding or to ""cram"" facts. This issue is difficult because it depends on the subject. In some subjects like Physics it is more important to practice understanding and approaching theories rather than learning facts by heart. In other subjects, like medicine, both facts and understanding are essential. But to know facts dominates. I believe that focusing on studying facts is the better option, because if they are learned appropriately they will last forever. To study facts intensively and frequently is preferable because it's the basis of your knowledge and therefore the basis of your proficiency. Facts you once gained will be available at any time when required. For example a doctor always has to rely on his / her basic knowledge ofphysiology. If he she had to look up a process before curing, treatment would take too long. In addition, would such a behaviour be reliable? Because facts are the basis of our jobs I think most studies should focus on building reliable knowledge.

593292.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that ''most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are''. Usually the products in the advertisements are shown to be more good looking,elegant,tasty,good texture,and all the higher qualities, for which most of the time they don't possess all those qualities. For example take an advertisement forsuiting and shirtings,the dress they show seems to be very beautiful and attractive,elegantly coloured, but the same when you see it truely may not be so good,the stitching may not be so perfect ,the colour shades may not be appropriate and it may not fit well. The other example, if we take the advertisements regarding food products ,they show them to be very tasty and delicious and they also show that they can be prepared within a few minutes,but actually when we really taste them they may not be that delicious,or it may even take a long time to prepare them. Even the advertisements for various medical products show that the medicine works really faster ,in a more efficient way,and they show all the things that make us appeal that the product is of superior quality,but in reality they may be associated with various side effects and may act differently on different individuals or even the costs may be higher. For example once i was watching an advertisement on the television which was about equipment for reducing weight. The advertisement said that we got to workout only for 15minutes on that equipment and no diet necessary and it would make you lose about 5 pounds per week,and even though they were showing some of the people and their experiences who used that product and by looking at all those i was so tempted to buy the product and ordered it,but once when i got the product and started using it for afew days,i couldn't see any loss in my weight but i also noticed knee pain problems by using that equipment.","So,with that i clearly came to know that I never believed in advertisements as they usually make the products seem better than they really are to increase their sales.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore,with that i clearly came to know that I never believed in advertisements as they usually make the products seem better than they really are to increase their sales.","So, from that experience, I realized that I should not trust advertisements, as they often exaggerate the quality of products to boost their sales."

1799186.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I stand behind the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. There are three reasons: changed society, health and the internet. First, comparing it to some decades before to the present, society has completely changed. Old timers spent time on themselves to live somehow to earn as much money as possible when they were young. However, young people these days are given almost any goods which are essential for everyday life when they are born. Therefore, young people can spend their time enjoying themselves. Secondly, although in order to enjoy life, people should be healthy, older people are more likely not to be healthy than young people. If they are sick, even if they are very optimistic people, it is usually hard for people to enjoy their life enough. Lastly, in present circumstances, in order to enjoy this worldwide and borderless society, people need to operate a computer and use an internet service enough. To operate a computer is a kind of hard for older people. For instance, my father who is 65 years old can only type with his right hand so he spends a lot of time operatinga computer. Also on the occasion of the computer being crushed, my father, one of the older people, couldn't solve the situation. On the other hand, young people are more used to using a computer and know much about it and the Internet.","In their age, computers have no more complicated material than mere everyday staff like a microwave.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,1.0,"Moreover, computers are more complicated to use than everyday appliances like a microwave.","In their time, computers were not more complex than everyday appliances like a microwave."

1023469.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion, i don't agree with the statement that was mentioned in the question and i believe that students should understand ideas,concepts and also learn facts. All facts started as ideas, concepts , hypotheses and theories then after many researches and studies they become facts. incontrast,many facts and things that we believe are true, they become questionable and adoubtable. For instance, i once read an e-mail that talked about the fact that Americans were the first people who went to the moon which becomes questionable when a professional photographer provides a paper that analyzes the pictures that were taken on the moon by the American and political issues areinvolved.

1192291.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I believe that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and this can be inferred from different reasons. The first of these is that we are living in a very competitive world and this gets people to make bigger details more than what they are, to involve the clients in buying the product. A typical example can be found in a lot of good for children, where really little features are presented ""in scale"", for example the ability for the toy to rise in size or the ability to make strange movements. Another reason could be a legal process. The productor is covering himself by legitimating something of the good. First this could be a bed advertisement , but could also explain the particular nature of the object, really fragile, a quality that could be researched from the client. There is also an ""internal"" reason if we want to say so. The manager wants to present a creation to the stakeholders and needs to have their approval to start the production. In this case the interest of the productors is directed to the owner of the company, not to the client, but it is important too, of course. The last reason is similar to the first, in this case we can find people who are presenting only the positive points of the products without talking about the negative.","The mission of this manner is the same but here the people aren't creating anything, they are missing a part of the complete reality, differently in the first case where the people could also present the negative points because there are a huge number of positive points which cover them.",-1.0,,,,,,1.0,,"The mission of this manner is the same but here the people aren't creating anything, they are  introducing a number of positive points.","The goal in this case is similar, but here people are omitting parts of the complete reality.

Schools take away the most part of the day and personal study takes away another big percentage. The rest of the day is used by young people to relax or to have fun. A critic reader might say that these aspects are secondary, but it is not totally true.

121551.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people might say that learning facts is important for students without understanding ideas and conceps because the way is more convincing to grasp some knowledge. However, I believe that understanding ideas and concepts process is more important for students to learn something because of several reasons. First of all, understanding ideas makes students not lose the ideas easily. without understanding means students study not deeply because if they study to get more reasons and information, they will be able to understand and not to forget it easily. For example, when i was a high school student, I learned about my country's history. My teacher let us know just the history's facts, and it was too difficult to understand. Although i got a high score in the class, I cannot now remember anything because I couldn't really get it without understanding. If my teacher and I had tried to understand about my country's history, I would have explained about that fluently. Another reason I believe students need to understand concepts is that knowing the studies' concepts helps students to study the course comfortably. If you go some where without knowing the direction, do you feel comfortable? I don't think so because unknowing where we are going makes people feel frustrated and lose confidence.","According to the news I've watched, 45% of students who know about the taking course's conceptby teacher's explainations show higher achievements from the course in that they can know what the course is going on.",-1.0,1.0,,,,,,,"According to the news I've watched, 45% of students who know about the taking course's conceptby teacher's explainations show higher achievements from the course, because they can understand the objectives of the course.","According to a news report I watched, 45% of students who understand the concepts of a course through their teacher's explanations show higher achievements because they have a clearer understanding of the course material."

When we search for successful people's lives we can see what made them successful is that they find new subjects , create something new, they find new ways, new styles etc. To continue what you know well doesn't make you successful but it can make you experienced. Being experienced is good and essential for doing a job but it cannot build your ability to create something and change your life style or thinking style. When we look at some artists or scientists' lives, we can see that they tried to live in a different way and change something which they never lived before.",So what makes people remember and artists because they do different things and make a change in people's lives.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore, what makes people remember and artists because they do different things and make a change in people's lives.","So, what makes people remember artists is that they do different things and make a change in people's lives."
1128278.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Giving a real contribution to the community is an important social aspect. In my opinion the time dedicated to this purpose should take a part in the life of any of the members of a community. I disagree with the statement because I think that young people nowadays are the most involved in helping their community. Many of my friends give their contribution to different social activities and they do not earn money for that. They simply do that because they believe in the importance of their help. I think that young people are more involved in helping communities rather than grown ups. This could be ascribed to the different amount of time which they have. Grown ups are more likely to be involved in career and in family so they are not able to dedicate a large amount of time to this purpose. Instead, young people have more free time and, in addition, less worries to deal with. Therefore is reasonable that they use this chance to help other people in the community. However, according to me there is also another reason why young people are also more involved in giving their time to the health of the community. A young man is typically more idealistic and full of enthusiasm. Therefore we can imagine how a boy can enjoy the idea of helping people spontaneously.",On the contrary a father might prefer to use his time and his resources to help his own family.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"However, a father might prefer to use his time and his resources to help his own family.","On the other hand, a father might prefer to use his time and resources to support his own family."

1727075.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that "" It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts"" because, a student can also learn easily if he understands the idea and concept on the topic he is being learning. For example, let us take the example of two students who attended a lecture in their school. The first students learn the topic and try to memorise the topic in the lecture class only whereas, the second student tries to understand the lecture and put his own ideas into learning the topic. After a few days the first student has many chances to forget the lecture which has been explained in the class whereas the second student does not forget the lecture topic. Secondly, if a student understands the ideas and concepts of the topic he can do well in implementing his own ideas in his future whereas if a student tries to learn he might get through the present situation but will not be able to persuade in his future without the concept of understanding.",A person can be successful in his life only if he understands the topic which he is learning otherwise it is nothing but saving the data into a machine which cannot understand or do any thing without the help of others.,-1.0,,,,,,,1.0,"A person can be successful in his life only if he understands the topic which he is learning.

I also think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because you will learn a lot about the subject, you will be taught everything you have to know about it, and you will know all its different characteristics. For example, if you arrive at university and you choose to learn economics sciences, I think it is better to take different courses related to it than to take, for example, one italian class, one class in modern art and so on. that are not related together.

446062.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. On the one hand I agree with this idea but on the other hand I think it is not true. Of course young people usually have no responsibilities and serious problems to be sad. They play games and they live without thinking about their future. Young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragic events of life.

On the one hand I agree with this idea but on the other hand I think it is not true. Of course young people usually have no responsibilities and serious problems to be sad. They play games and they live without thinking about their future. Young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragic events of life.

Recently, the world has become very busy and society has changed drastically compared to 50 years ago. There are two main reasons which prevent young people from helping their communities. First of all, young people become very busy, they can not spend enough time in their community. For example, nowadays, young people go to not only school for studying but also private schools. Around 75% of junior high school and high school students in Tokyo, Japan go to private school twice a week till night. In this situation, it is very difficult for students and young people to spare the time in their community. Moreover, young people's lives have been changed. They play with their friends in the city not only in their community. The city has been developed, and there are many entertainments, such as movies, internet cafes, and shopping buildings.

One of the reasons for this is that alot of people are moving in and out of Tokyo because of their studies and work, and people do not settle down. Thus nobody will take care of local activities. On the otherhand, young people in the suburbs tend to move out to big cities for study and work and come back several years later, and naturally, they cannot join or help their communities.","In conclusion, I support that young people thesedays don't give enough time to help their communities because of luck of time and change of community.",-1.0,,,,,,,,"In conclusion, I support that young people thesedays don't give enough time to help their communities because of ""lack"" of time and change of community.","In conclusion, I believe that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities due to a lack of time and the significant changes within the community itself."
1838943.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that it is more important for the students to learn the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts. The reason why ideas and concepts are more important is that learning a certain subject will be much easier to understand by students. Students have different ways that they learn. Some of them learn from facts, but most of them learn from ideas and concepts. Most of the time the facts can be difficult to understand. Teachers can teach the students the basic ideas and the concepts in order to understand easily and quickly. For instance, the first few weeks in my government class my teacher taught using facts, but most of the time, many facts were confusing to me. Then, I asked my friend for help, but most of my friends that I asked were confused by many government systems. After, I talked to my teacher about where I was confused and the way he taught us.

In addition,the resources of energy play an important role in my decision and affect the existence of a large number of cars in the last twenty years. To start with,we have to know that the resources of energy have been developed through the last decades. First,people relied on themselves for transportation then they began to depend on animals like horses and camels. Then more resources began to appear like the resources of steam energy which could be developed after the appearance of the cook. Then the development continued until the finding of the petrolum. Then the activity of this type spreads alot and continues till now in its growth. The oil (a part of the petrolum components) drived alot of fields in the improving and developing of cars' inventions. The manufacturing process of cars is now one of the biggest industries in the world. That oil has become available in many countries and there is a good reserve for it. Also,the iron factories which become more advanced and have the ability to provide large amounts of it for the process. Indeed, high technology has appeared in recent years in the field of improving the characteristics of materials used in the industry which helps to invent new ones which can bear the impacts well and have small weight. In fact,this process is in conjunction with the development of materials in the industry that it makes the reduction of impairments in many materials increase their quality and decrease their costs.

Personally, I think that age isn't the only factor to check the enjoyment of life. Among many factors that help people enjoy their life, the first factor is a hobby. Having hobbies makes people use their time useful. I have a friend who has a hobby, making pro-models. If he had spare time, he would go to a pro-model shop. He actually likes that kind of making. So, I've never seen him waste their spare time uselessly. I think he knows how to enjoy his life in his own way. Another factor is a friend. From kindergarten's time on, people usually spend their time with their friends. With friends, we did our homework, played outdoors, and struggled with them. We can't imagine life without our friends. This means having good friends helps people to enjoy their life more. I have a good friend. He seems like he always has a fun time with me and our other friends. If he didn't exist with me, I would get stuck in boredom. Whenever we have spare time, he schedules a tour plan and watches movies and sports. Thanks to him, I doubt that I actually enjoy my life more than others.

666.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. But from my point of view, the opposite is the truth. I think it is hard for a young man to enjoy his life better than an older man. First of all, nowadays few young people are aware of the purpose of their lives. It is hard to say that a person can be happy without knowing the purpose of his life. Instead, many of them idle their precious time. They do not know what they should care most about in their life. Older people, on the contrary, know exactly what their purpose is. So they do not care much about other trifles as young people do. They know how to set up a goal and keep chasing it. This is what I envy older people most. One of my cousins spent two years in college and tried to find her favorite major. But even now she cannot make up her mind because she changes her interests so frequently. Furthermore, young people are not mature enough to control themselves. So they make more mistakes. Many young people do things just out of an impulse,. Sometimes it can be dangerous to do things this way. As for older people, most of them know clearly what is right and what is wrong. They have their own judgements and they can often do things according to their life experiences. No wonder our young people always need an adult to teach us right from wrong. Finally, young people are much easier to give in to temptations,especially in today's society. They are not steady enough to avoid the bad effects of many negative things in our society. But as for older people, they have seen much more than us, so they know when and how to say no to temptations.","So, I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person.",-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore, I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person.","S: Therefore, I believe that older people find it easier to enjoy life compared to younger people."
1220399.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Considering the academic period of education there can be a lot of plots,ideas and many other impressions on specialize in one specific subject or is it better to have a variety of many academic subjects. On answering that question, primarily we have to deal with two major points in education which indicate the position of our life and future outcomings. The first is our life situation. The latter one is about the plans and feed backs. If a person in academics wondered to make an extend to vary his knowledge,mostly he or she would have no economic problems or any anxiety about his working conditions. To explain that,they have already satisfied with their life style and they wonder to know much more knowledge. Besides their motivation for learning varieties have almost acts them to doing that relentlessly. For me, becoming one pointed or one focused training programme makes a person much more aware of life and in worklife. In work life for instance, a person must be well qualified in his or her matter. While dealing with the problems in the work sector, a person must be elite in his or her section for being a qualified one. Thats why , focusing on one section would be more essential and vital for the person in a specific range. It is also crucial for me that a person must be aware of his lifestyle standards. Choosing one section field may not help utterly to person. Being aware of the field and determined what to do are also other necessities. A great deal of time has to be spent on one section field. You have to asses your knowledge often or you may fail in advancing information.",Holding both advantages and disadvantages focusing on one field is my indispensable choice.,-1.0,,,1.0,,,,,"Therefore, olding both advantages and disadvantages focusing on one field is my indispensable choice.","Focusing on one field, despite its advantages and disadvantages, is my indispensable choice."
