1265932.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In this topic, some students prefer learning facts, others believe understanding ideas and concepts is better. Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts. It is hard to catch the main ideas, students may only be interested in the stories, but didn't know the meaning. It can't happen when you focus on the ideas or the concepts. Because the concepts and ideas are the standard for whole stories. In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content of this course. Although the facts can let them know how to use it in society, it still limited. However we can't refuse it and it can lead to students getting some experience. It is still not general for the students. Finally, the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course. The facts concluding different types of knowledge. They are all useful.",But the knowledge which is discussed in the course may lead students to the wrong way.,1
119361.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Cars have been playing an extremely important role in society nowadays. While people are enjoying their obvious advantages, problems come accompanied with the convenience they bring. More and more people are complaining about the air pollution that cars create. However, cars, as for me, will also exert a great influence on human society in the future. And their number will not even decrease. On the contrary, the development of cars will be surprising and momentous. Twenty years can be a long time or a short time, but the development of the quality of cars, including speed, security would be tremendously huge. People will definitely enjoy these obvious advantages in the thought of travelling to more places in the world that have become smaller and smaller. And there are also other aspects in their development. As you know, many institutes and countries have been doing research to find a fuel that possesses both efficiency and environmental benefits.",Progress has been made in these research.,1
241910.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Nowadays, an increasing number of people like travelling. Someone said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, because the guide knows the place more deeply than the travellers, and a group of people will have more fun. But others think that travelling with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfortable. And i'm one of them. First of all, if you have a tour guide and a group of companions, you will not feel very free. Travelling with a tour guide, the plan will be formerly ordered, something you want to see another thing or want to go to another place will not be allowed. You can't change the plan. But for me, the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like, but i can't change, because of the whole ground. That makes me feel very upset. And a large number of people will have a large number of opinions. It's difficult to recognize the idea. And some people will not follow the rules. Once i joined a travelling group, but we had to wait for one or two people all the time after visiting some scenery. I felt that's a waste of my time. Then, travelling with a group by a tour guide is always very busy, you can't visit one thing in a comfortableway, there's only limited time that you can stay in one place. The whole journey is at a quick pace so that you can't enjoy it. And most of the tour guides will let you go to some place which they will get benefits from.",But this kind of place really wastes our life.,1
1630850.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years from now, surely. Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem. Many countries are suffering from traffic jams. The government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jams.",And one other problem as serious as the above is the environmental thing.,1
661192.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,Our society is a society of value. I mean people often like us for what we did rather than what we are.,This statement allows people to try new things.,1
1526310.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this. When people watch television, read newspapers or walk in the street, they see a lot of advertisements. Even though people don't concentrate on that, they already have influenced. The first problem is the company cheats the customers. When the company makes a commercial for selling a product, they usually try to show their products as the best and they tell them only good points.",Because they made people believe that products didn't have any defects and customers but it.,1
236812.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society. From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects.","For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable.",1
236812.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society. From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is because he does not know about the realities. If he had already learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into a puzzle. In addition, students always get more interest in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts. Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt to society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already knew the facts. Besides, students can also use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas.","In summary, it is obvious that ideas and concepts are much more important for students to learn than just understanding for the reason of the clearness of the reality, student's interests in the subject and the benefits for their future.",0
12040.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"This is a hard question, because success means not the same thing for all people, and also because both ways can take you to success. In my case, I am a tennis player. For me success would be to become a professional player. To achieve this there are no secret formulas, there are no new things to try, nothing like that, but doing what must be done, and what has been done since the early years of this sport, working for it. Also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind ""if it is working and giving you results do not change or try something new"", successful tennis players do not take great risks, nor try new things, they just do what they know they do best, and stick to it if it is working. So this makes me think things should work like this in every other subject, if something is giving you success, why change it? Maybe if you are just in search of that ""success"" in other subjects rather than sports you should try new things, for example in pizzas, we have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Peter Piper Pizza, etc.","so maybe thinking in subjects like this is hard to achieve success following the same steps others did long ago, because of all the competition, maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so competitive subject, so maybe here it is when you will have to try new things, explore new markets etc.",1
528240.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,Understanding ideas and concepts is one of the most important reasons for the education of young people.,I strongly agree with this statement so that all the facts have an origin in an idea.,1

1106913.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"this question reminds me of the time i chose my way when i was a high school student. I definitely agree with the statement that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject for three reasons. first, it provides us with a broad and comprehensive point of view. in reality, there are many problems that cannot be solved by one point view. for example, you can refer to the environmental problems or poverty and so on. the environmental problems are related to chemistry, economics, or politics. poverty is also connected with many points of view such as sociology, economics, agriculture and so on. there is no problem that can be solved with only one point of view. you have to integrate your broad knowledge to find the solution. second, it can give the students choices about which field they want to study and have a career in. it is stupid to force students to choose their field without knowing many subjects and which field suits them. especially in japan, students must choose their discipline before they enter the universities.","therefore, i was frustrated doing it, and chose my current program at my university which allows you to study whatever you want while you are an undergraduate student.",1
838581.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, most young people don't know what misery is. I'm talking about countries like France, the USA or Germany, and so on. Countries that are rich. When you have everything you need, you can not imagine that you could help people who would love to have your help. I agree that nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their colleagues. But this is not true only for young people. Nowadays, in our society, everyone thinks about him before someone else. It's called 'selfish'. And i definitely can not agree with this because even if we have the chance to leave in a rough country, poverty exists. Young people and also adults have to pay attention to their community. But if we want young people to help, adults have to show an example. We must have a lot of people who help each other because it is so much easier to live this way. First, when you help someone, you bring him so much happiness that he will feel much better quickly, and you give yourself a good satisfaction by doing it. But the man, or woman you did help will do it for someone else. And this other person for another, and so on. By the way, if you think about this, by helping each other, this is all society who will feel better,and if there are more people doing this, after a while, fewer people will need help. I know it's not possible to solve everyone's problem, but it's a dream that can come true. There are 6 billion people on Earth, so is it better to have 6 billion people who don't care except themselves, or is it better to have 6 billion people who are crew.",I will finish like this.,0
1607000.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think to be successful you don't need to do different things but to do things differently. Success and what are the essential ingredients which make a situation or a person successful? In simple terms, success is achieving goals with maximising efficiency.",To set a goal for himself and envision the future is what successful men do differently.,1
1012427.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with this statement. No matter whether successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing. Successful people try new things and taking risks are the best thing that they need to do. For example, an animal professor who discovers medicine for humans. If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have, so this is not called discovery and they are no longer needed. Of course they need to find new medicines and it involves risks because they test animals. Another example is students who are successful in studying. Why are they successful? The reason is they already try new things such as reading a lot of different books and communicating with teachers. The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required. If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful students? They will stay the same without studying new things. They cannot only study what they know well. Otherwise, they cannot be open-minded. For me, I have a personal story about this topic. I am trying new things and also taking risks.",I came to America for study.,1

1531692.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I prefer having a broad knowledge of different academic subjects that are specialized in one specific subject. Specializing in a specific field is not a weird decision, we can see in our daily lives that there are a lot of people that in the last year of degree decide to continue studying in a specific field of knowledge. However, from my own point of view and experience I prefer having a broad knowledge of different subjects , because this is translated into a person who is able to face different topics in a discussion or debate. First of all, I would like to explain my choice by arguing that in the future I would like to work in a business in which to do dynamic work. I mean, consultants, for instance, change the projects on which they are working every week, so they have to deal with different subjects, such as telecommunications, energy resources, the economy. That is what I like! ! ! However, as I said before, many people decide to specialize in a field. This is the case of professors at university.","For example, in the faculty of Chemistry we can find different departments: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, thermodinamics.",1
237139.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I agree with the statement because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts. The first factor is age at this age as a student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are the first step for a student. At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts. Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts.,Any student who is getting older can learn from his past about the facts.,0

Some people say that the numbers will decrease because alternative transportation will be popular in the future. However, I firmly believe that cars' occupation will increase because of the lack of technology and economic growth. Firstly, the technologies to make other good modes of transport are not developed yet. Although modern technology has developed to a higher point, it is hard to make more economical and popular transportation than cars in twenty years. In the future, other modes of transport such as sky-train will appear, but not in twenty years. Besides, economics are growing consistently to the extent to support non-wealthy people, These will make most people afford to and maintain their cars.",It is a similar result to computer occupation.,1

58551.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"There are several views which are related to this topic. Some may think that there is no helping from young people for their communities. However, I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Nowadays, there are a lot of social problems in the world. These problems have to be solved by citizens. However, if it can't solve the first generation, the new generation, young people is needed. Therefore, we can easily observe from the cases that most university students participate in their society. They sometimes resist unfair politics or not good enough international plans. In this case, we can realize how they are really interested in their society and try to help their communities. Furthermore, all societies are educating young people. This education makes students think and adjust to their new life when they grow up. So we can not determine that they are not helping their communities.",Because studying is the basic resource which makes educated people think about social problems and to find the way to solve some problems.,1
1599863.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place.","Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there.",1

1009294.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In an aspect of shot time,It seems more effective to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize how much information or how many facts we learned and knew. However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others. There are two aspects to all the information we face everyday. One is the fact that we can see easily. It is like a penonmenon in nature. We can believe what we can see. The other is the concept that we can see only when we study it and we understand it. If people understand a certain information, it means that people know how the information is formed, what the information and how they can apply it to others. It is good for students because they must have interest in the information when they can understand it totally and apply it to others. It can make students keep studying and learning.","Lastly, understanding ideas is less boring than learning fats.",1

The students' main aspect of learning things is by understanding the facts beside them and the other way is to understand the ideas and concepts about them. In the olden days students used to learn things by learning the facts about the things which they were going to learn, As it certainly takes more time to learn a particular subject as they have to know what the actual subject is and how it is going to work, it is a time consuming thing to learn a particular subject. while coming to learn a subject by knowing or understanding the ideas and concepts about the subject is the best way to teach students about the subject and solve them easily. let us consider an example to solve a mathematical problem to find the area of a given triangle,which is given to two different students in the class, who can solve the problem by knowing the facts and the other student who understands the ideas and concepts of the problem. response who knows the facts of the problem and the student who understands the ideas and concepts.

Young people can enjoy more kinds of sports than old people do because their physical condition allows them more chances to do things like snowboarding, motorcycle riding, mountain climbing, sky diving which need more wild actions and physical abilities. No one can say old people can enjoy these sports too. Sports are one of the most important ways of enjoying our life. Furthermore old people are much more conservative than young people when they challenge something new in their life. For example, they have to consider their family and company before challenging new things. However young people feel more free to launch new things. They are much braver than old people so that they can experience more new world events even though they fail sometimes.",That is o.,1

The very purpose of that advertisement is lost now a days, they are just showcasing the product , then it originally exhibits its characteristics , comparing it with other products and fooling the public of the worth of the product, then really it has. They use some girls , for advertising face creams, before they use this product they look not beautiful, but using the products for a few times brings change. It seems, they will be looking charming, how does this happen, its just the camera trick and the make up they are given , if we use it orginally will we get that change, no definetlty no For example take an product, namely toothpaste, the companies related to it are pepsodent, colgate, closeup, all this product have same ingredients and mixtures of same level , but while advertising each company showcases its own product , differently, comparing with others , not mentioning name of the differnt company, that their companies product has better features than others, u just tell me how the product desingned with same formula , but with companies different have different features.","So the way advertising is now used is just showcasing the product than it originally was, making the product seem much better than it really is.",1

1134094.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly.","The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparison to the risk resident people face.",1

Big companies use strong advertising and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spend time on the products. Moreover, interacting with friends takes most young people's time. All of these activities occupied every minute of them. Second, education from young people's parents does not give them the idea.

That's why they say about that. They don't know so the children don't have to know. I think that's kind of stupid. And the adults scared of the kids will learn that something they didn't know. I think it is a very good thing to know about the facts and concepts. I know it's hard, but if you learn that your world will change. Don't you think that's a more interesting thing than just learning from the text? I think yes. So iwant kids to know about the facts and facts. Then they will be interested in lots of things.

1952060.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand the ideas and concepts. There are two reasons why I believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. First, if students don't know about the facts perfectly and only understand about its circumstances and ideas, they will not know what the truth is. This would make students confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood the concepts of.","They could do well according to what they have understood about, but if it is wrong what they have understood, they will fail at the moment.",1

He tried to learn computers because it was very interesting. later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself.

1758784.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"First of all I want to say, what the question deals with. I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part. You should know everything about this part. I want to give an example. If you want to specialize in marketing,you have to know everything about it. You can only be hired in this part of a firm.",And if you are not needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked.,0

1886379.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge. There are three reasons why I think that. First of all , It will be very boring to study one subject for a long time. In fact , you might get totally exhausted and you might even lose interest in that subject. For example, students who are good at calculation study math for a long time and would also like to change the studying subject to a subject that can be read without using your hands or brain. Secondly, you can know what you are really interested in when you study a bit of various subjects.",This is the reason why education doesn' t focus on a specific subject and it can also make up the choice of what we really like about a student after a long time of basic education till high school.,1
1408795.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The world changes very fast. People change with the world and they have to adapt to society in the best way. Young people nowadays have different tasks to do from the people who were young in the past. Today life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different to those 20 years ago. A young person has to go to college or university, maybe he has to work if he wants to pay for his studies or other activities. The free time is not a lot, so when a student is free, he usually goes out with his friends and to think about enjoying activities like going to a disco or listening to music. Someone might think that it is selfish but I am sure that a young person must have a leisuretime. However the time can be spent for the communities. It's quite true that a lot of young people don't like helping their communities. The young people nowadays are not all lazy. I can explain this point by a clear example. Last week I went to a rock party which was organized by one of my best friends. He worked a lot because this event was wonderful, but he did it with other guys. The party was a music competition. There were a lot of people and everyone was very happy because the players were fantastic and the organization was too. In conclusion I think that today young people are different from the young people in the past so a comparison is not so easy. The free time is less and the things to do are more.",The young people's mistake is to think that doing something for the communities is boring.,1
1329241.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family.","I would like to give an example of my father who is a manager in a company, When i was a toddler he taught me to take first firm few steps in the path of my life and gave me good quality education by enrolling me in a good public school where i could set fort my academicjourney, so he has the responsibility to give me a good career in the path of my life by giving much attention to me he rather by enjoying himself he gave me platform to secure me future to path of success.",1
852796.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Nowadays we can watch on television a great number of advertisements for a lot of products. Consequently, we can wonder whether the products we see on television are really good or not. I totally disagree with advertisements because they turn people into stupid. Most people buy products only because they have seen them on television and think that they are good. Most of the time the products are not really so good. For example, there are a lot of advertisements for food whereas everybody knows that these products are very bad for one's health. That is why I think that advertising is really a con and is here only to attract naive people and so that businessmen might make a lot of money on those poor people. Moreover, in my opinion most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Western countries are living under the reign of money. Money attracts money, that is capitalism and this is one of the reasons why advertising exists. On the other hand, food scandals are more or less the consequences of advertised products.","For example, I can quote foot and mouse disease or mad cow disease.",1

It will be a new experience if we take risks and invent new things. This boosts our confidence and gives us a new experience.

Then they can know more about the country or the place they are planning to go to. there are many ways to do that. For example reading books or asking some friends or going to atravel agency to help them or to advise them to place that they shouldgo to. i think the best way of having more information and knowledge is to have a tour guide that can help the travelers and make them have fun. I think that is a good way to get more information and make the travelers not miss the best places that people should visit. I think that it is more effective and helpful because, having a tour guide and he or she is usually from the place that the traveler is heading too. The tour guide will provide a lot of information and advice to the traveler much then asking a friend. For example he or she will have the best to teach or inflounce the traveler. In addition, some times the tour guide will teach the traveler the country's culture and language or slang that the travel agency can not do. That will make them have more information known and information about the people who live in this country. Also, it will make it easy for the traveler to ask them about the culture. Because usually travelers have a lot of questions that they need to know now about the culture that they are going to and it is not easy for them to ask someone who lives there. Also the tour guide can introduce the people or the traveler to the cultural food or the best places to go or the best hotels or cities because they will much know about it.","For example, last year i went with my family to Hong Kong, China which is the biggest city in the east corner of China.",1

According to me I prefer to have extra information about one topic instead of having knowledge about more than one topic. For some reasons such as ; being happy or earning more money. First of all; Having extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist in this area. it is such an important feature of making your job good. If you improve yourself really extraordinarily in a specific subject, it also brings you success and power. For instance; you are a doctor and you are really successful in your job.

All successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evolving their companies and buying or creating new ones. I also think that one of the most important things for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power!

It says the importance of learning not only the facts but also the "" way"". But it highlights the importance of the way. Like this old saying, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. First, If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions. For example, when I was a middle school student, at the start of math class, I couldn't understand what the teacher said. But finally understood the way of solving the math problems, I could solve another math question. Although that question was more difficult, I understood the way of solving it so I could do it. If I couldn't understand, I couldn't answer that question. Second, If students understand ideas and concepts, they can imagine more ideas and concepts. I mean, for instance, when I was a high school student, I learned about poetry. Most people don't like poets because of their words. Those words were difficult to understand except by the teacher. Teacher could understand all of the words. That is why it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, I couldn't understand because I didn't have any idea.",So I agree with that statement.,1

46344.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Others believe the best way to travel is on your own. Both opinions have their advantages and disadvantages actually. I agree with the second opinion. To me, traveling on your own is much better. First of all, when you travel on your own, you are free to go wherever you like. You can design your own tour according to your likings and interests. You can manage your time better. That will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the places you like better. Another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spending according to your budget. In a group, the places you will visit are determined by the tour guide, and unfortunately, you cannot change it. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide costs a certain amount of money, which probably would cost you less if you planned it yourself. You should follow the tour guide and go to the restaurants the guide determines as opposed to getting your own food. For example, my husband and I planned an ""interrail"" trip in Europe a couple of years ago. It was all on our own. We planned in advance where, when, how, for how long we would go. It was more fun to explore the places on our own since we had the chance to interact with local people in their regular daily life. We made friends too. As a result, I strongly support the idea of travelling on your own.","You have more freedom, you interact with people and you make friends.",1
439202.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"This is a controversial issue to define the important factor for students. Someone's priority knowledge of ideas and concepts that students gain is the most important factor in education However, others may say that experiences from facts are an important factor for students. These priorities would depend on everyone's previous life experience. In my case, I grew up in a school that gave me a mixed educational method,and that the method was equally balanced. Since I recognise mixed educational policy, both factors are key to obtaining better concepts, and at least I can say both factors were needed and just one of those would not bring a significant result. When I was an elementary school student, I learned the concept of insects. That was the first time that someone told me a concept. I was engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insects. This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant amount of knowledge even though I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insects. This experience made me realise the importance of understanding ideas brings me more knowledge.","In contrast with this experience, I learned concept from fact that I faced an earthquake when I was 10 years old.",1

715539.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I personally agree with this statement. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy, it is true. But let me tell you this; Albert Einstein has a quote: ""Knowledge is power. ""which is completely true. Think of Biology without Chemistry; Chemistry without Physics; Physics without Geometry: Geometry without Maths and so on. A chemist cannot explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without Physics, can he? Or a Physics master cannot measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lights it, can he? Another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago. Take Pascal as an example. He has a lot of proven theories in Maths  and Physics. Isn't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored in and made himself known in? The answers to these questions I pointed out are simple and true: The laws of nature, the languages spoken, people and all the others that we know of are in only one place: here on earth. No one can prove that the facts about it aren't linked to one another. The links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end, you will end up finding yourself at the other. So, learning Physics, learning Chemistry, learning Literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about.",You will find yourself on the other hand if you study hard and learn a lot.,1

1355292.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It seems that there has been an argument that young people in this society spend a lot of time helping their communities. There are some points of views that students already participate in enough communities. However, in my opinion this cannot be true in terms of. In this essay. I will briefly present two reasons supporting my opinion. Most of all, individualism causes young people nowadays not to concern themselves about their communities. Most families in this country have one or two children, and they cannot have a chance to experience cooperation. They grew up only with their parents and without any siblings so it is hard to know how to share or yield for others that can learn from a large family. As a result, these children tend to behave individually and do not think about others who need help. This is the main reason why I think young people hardly help others in their communities. Moreover, schools and other organizations require students to do something for society without their own will. What I mean is that this requirement has a bad influence on students. It may help students spend at least time volunteering but they will avoid helping others because of this rule, which is essential to go to a good school or get a better job in our country.","In my opinion, helping someone that they don't want to do makes them not do any volunteer work except required time.",1

I personally agree that trying new things helps you to become successful because trying can help you to learn all the other capabilities in one self for example, somebody took a job of pizza delivery for some reason, for example, suddenly needingmoney , dropped out of college and while doing this job he learned that he knew so much about the city that he could try to be a tourist guide. In doing so there is a big risk involved in giving up a well earning job to somethingfairly new. But until he doesn't try it he may never in his life be able to do anything else except being a pizza delivery person. secondly ,It helps you to know how to deal with different situations at different points. If one fails in his first attempt ,he knows what precautions he need to take incase he tries to do the same thing next time.","One of the strong examples I would like to mention at this point is ""Gandhi"".",1

1729734.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well. The most important thing in life is improving and challenging yourself and it helps the person to succeed in the future. Eventhough it involves high risk , you really should try it. To improve your skills, career, and knowledge, you have to challenge yourself. The most successful people are the people who do not fear failing. The person who fears failing can not challenge new things. I was that kind of person when i came to America. I did not try or challenge new things. I did not speak English at all because i was afraid of failing and someone might laugh at my poor English. After a few months, i realized i was wrong.","In fact, although i live in America, my english has not improved at all.",0
1581339.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks. The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal, he wants to have something new and more difficult to do. Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succeeded in something, he will always want more. Alpinists, for example, don't usually stop climbing after they manage to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other mountain , harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conqueror, didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finally defeated.","And I think because he was successful for the first time, he couldn't get rid of his willpower.",1

An other reason would be the fact that successful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships. Well, he is now looking forward to becoming a Formula one driver. Because he wants something new. Something that gives him the opportunity to achieve another great goal. The last important factor is, according to me, the fact that when somebody manages to win something, or to earn something, he would probably want to get more of it.","No matter if it is money, glory or power.",1

110274.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Whether to be a person who is equipped with plenty of knowledge from all kinds of academic subjects or just to be a professor in one field is not a straightforward issue. Everyone keeps their own opinion on it. While it comes to me, I would say that being a professor is more beneficial. First of all, people should save their energy from obtaining knowledge from all categories of fields, which does good for our advanced education. Energy, just like time for humans, is limited. With this limited energy, one can do what he or she likes to do.

This personal barrier we unconsciously establish in our minds, limiting our personal objective's optimum results. We compete every day with more developed and evolutionized minds. Qualities that a person may possess, may limit the desire to abroad their studies. Some determinations, obstacles or maybe the lack of interest may affect ones' studies. Setting and focusing the minds is an essential fact for acquiring knowledge. Determinations may hold one back, establishing only to study what they are truly passionate about. What people don't see is that to have to optimmum product towards being the best at your passion, one must be prepared for everything and anything. Obstacles may be presented on a road towards success, but the key is to overcome the obstacles and learn from them, exposing every day the best of anybody. Another thing is the lack of interest one may gain if the subject to study is of extreme boredom. It may be a teacher's fault that the subject is disliked, there by causing the desire of the students to only study the specific subject and terminate the agony.

Young people have many goals that they want to achieve, for example they want to achieve good education, a high position.

At the beginning of the century my country suffered a civil war. People had big problems and they only tried to survive. They did not want to solve the problems of the others, they only wanted to eat and to care for their families. However, right now, not all people have big problems and they are more implicated in their communities. In my personal experience I could explain these arguments with several examples. When I was young, my teachers at highschool encouraged students to help other people in their subjects, even if those students were in an other school. I felt very well because I could help a lot of people who did not know how to speak or how to write. I remember two girls who were 8 years old and they didnt know how to read. I helped them twice a week for years and they finally learnt not only how to read, but also how to write. Furthermore, when I was at university, I created with my friends an organization that prepared conferences in order to obtain money for poor people. We could collect a lot of money by doing these conferences.

To be specific, in the time when people had difficulties finding information, people depended on their memory a lot. However, now people can access the internet to gather general information as much as they want. This means people do not need to memorize general things. In conclusion, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.",This is not only because students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible sources on the internet reduce the necessity of learning facts themselves.,1

1439837.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. This is undoubtedly true and i would absolutely agree with it. Today's generation have become more hardworking and sincere towards their career. There is so much competition that the young generation is just so busy preparing themselves for a better and more secure future. There is so much competition that one does not have the time and energy left to support their communities. They find it very demanding to support their very own survival and they feel it will hamper their future if they invest time in supporting their communities. One example i would like to mention here is that a friend of mine who used to always be busy supporting his community found that people started exploiting him and taking undue advantage of his goodness and kindness. He felt that he was putting his future at risk if he carried on helping his community and he was not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in times when he would be in crisis. Infact one day while he was helping a member of his community, that member said this line ""God helps those who help themselves"".",He told him to start helping yourself first by doing well in your academics and then helping your community.,1
1352639.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"As a senior in high school is sitting in a row , he is trying to figure out what he wants to become in the future. How does a person decide? School has given students the opportunity to learn many academic subjects. Whether it is Maths, or Chemistry the broad knowledge that it is combined with serves as a help to discover the inner talents and creativity that a person might possess. During senior year, one of the hardest decisions is to pick the major or career one wants to do in college. Would it help if a student only studied one specific subject? Is that really the students' true interest? I am senior in high school. At first all I thought I liked was math, and all I wanted to do was math. However, the school required some other regular classes and electives. My junior year in high school, I decided to take computer programming and I fell in love with it. Then this year I currently have physics and it is like my favorite class in the world. When it came down to making a decision about what I wanted to do with my life, I took all the different classes I took into consideration. Since, I had such a broad knowledge of many subjects like math, physics, and computers , I narrowed it down to electrical and computer engineering. I am very glad that the school provides such a variety of classes. However, this doesn't only apply to education, but to everyday life as well. A person may know how to count and mix chemicals together, but can he or she write a letter? Life doesn't rely on one subject, if not on many. It would be very useful to have at least a little bit of knowledge on different types of subjects. With this in mind a person doesn't always need to rely on others for help. A chemist can write correct reports.",A writer can keep organized his finances.,0

Our children today do not do alot of simple things like our fathers and grandfathers used to do. This is because many parents do not let their children try and experience how it would be for them to help your communities and communities nowadays do not open the chance for young people. First of all, parents do not let their children experiment with how it feels good when they help their communities because parents think that helping the community is a waste of time. Even if the children try to do these kinds of things they punish them and tell them to concentrate on their studies and forget about these kinds of things Therefore, even if the child has the intention of helping his community his parents may let him down. As a result the child willdo the same thing with his children when he growsup. In addition communities are not the same as they used to be.

1611251.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is more important for a student to understand concepts and ideas than to learn facts by hearing. This is for some simple reasons. It might be better for a student to learn facts, dates and results because that is what the teacher asks for. But in real life, this means life after school, the time you need to work for your money to survive, it is better to understand things. A person not able to understand what she or he is doing is not able to develop an idea to find mistakes and eliminate them. A person who is able to do this would be much more successful in her/his job, just because of being able to make the way of working more effective. In school this kind of understanding and finding solutions to problems should be taught. Another reason why a theme should be understood is because of fun. Fun motivates us to go on, to do more. For some people it might be perfect to learn by heart, but most of them get bored. The more effective way is to support the wishes of people to understand (who do not know the most frequently asked question of a child:""Why? ""). While supporting this wish, it is easier to motivate someone for some topic even if it is a theme with a lot of facts. I my self support this fact absolutely.",In school I had two different teachers in physics  in 2 years.,1
1119781.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people tend to do things which are not familiar with them and take risks. I have several reasons for this. First, challenging new things makes people well-rounded. To take a personal example, when I was a junior high school student, I hated studying liberal subjects, history,art, music. I had never been to museums or concert halls. However, when I was a university student, I changed my mind and tried to study liberal subjects. Thanks to the change, I became a well-rounded person who can talk to any person. As the above example illustrates, trying new things makes people well-rounded. Second, people can find their best ways when they try new things. For instance, four years ago, I applied for a new project in my company which I did not know how to do well. Although I had been a sales person for five years, I tried the production field of a computer company.",I did well because I know what the client wants for our products.,1

People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do.

They create an idea through the advertisement into the consumer's mind that their product is the answer to his problems.,"Excessive competitive advertisements cause a lot of distraction in consumers' minds which obliges companies to make their product seem much better than they really are and to an extent to make their product better than all of the other competitiveproducts; in other words to make their product ""The Unique Product"".",1

1818765.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible. It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future.",So this stuff will be prone to degregations.,1

Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects, I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it. First, when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic, he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth. These issues are often complex, and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable. As a result, it is possible to take a position on debated issues. For instance, I have studied psychology for many years and in my country, different types of psychology are debated now. Having this deep knowledge in this particular field, I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion. Also I can stand in a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue.

By the following years to date most households have at least one car or sometimes more than that. After this explosive growth in applying a car the awareness of polluting and damaging the environment is also increasing. This has been happening in the 1960's when the hippie movement was at its peak. This means that up from then, people began to think about the consequences of using a car and particularly using a car for movement for which a car isn't necessary. They also started to consider what kind of aftermath their behavior would have for their children and the children of their children. They recognize the impact of using a car for the environment, for example they receive that the high use of pollutants like cars can be harmful for the ozone layer. The turnover of conduct and so the try to treat the environment more carefully can also be found in many political strategies or in new laws for protecting the environment.

The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside.

1856265.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well. That means that it is so competitive in that area. If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others, it is rare to achieve success. Let's think about one example. There are a lot of Pizza Hut stores in our area. many of us know how to make it.

1192415.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, for two reasons. Here are my reasons. First, if one person doesn't want to give enough time to help other people that means he is selfish. I joined an interview process and new hired people training at my company. In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help. Once I worked for a local campaign , but I always helped people and did some volunteer work for a patient group. Till I want to work at a Global company. Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities? Give the poor person help to educate, get work and receive benefits. We will not have much more public problems. Moreover we will feel happy and lovely. For these two reasons, I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities. Young people are like sponges. What you teach them is what you earn.",Moreover young people have to study and they have the ability to care about other communities.,1

On the other hand when I travel without a tour guide I can stop wherever I want and I can do wherever i want , and if I do not know what places are the famous places of the city I can ask the people who live in that place or i can go to a library and look on the internet for the directions and then get a map and then I am ready to go wherever I want thus it is so fun because if I get lost I need to ask how to return and at the same time I know the city I know more people.","I know that it is a risk, because for example my friends and I are going to travel next weekend to Quertaro to visit some friends well they are members of my church, but I have never been there and no body that knows how to get to the city wants to come with us , so we decided to take the risk and we only have the map, the car and money, well I want to tell you that some times I feel afraid of getting lost or something like that but something inside of me tells me ""you can do whatever you want"" ( and I know that voice is Good, and.",1

1379069.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The issue at hand, is who does enjoy life, young people or old people? ?This subject is an interesting one, because it challenges all ages to enjoy life regardless of their age. From my point of view, I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones because they have all the abilities, health, and energy to enjoy life. The first reason I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones is because they have the motivation towards life, and life without motivation is like a car without oil. For example a young person will work hard towards improving his job description, or his capabilities, and from my point of view this is an enjoyableexperience. Whereas, an older age person does not have the motivation or energy to achieve any of his remaining goals. Another reason I believe that young people enjoy life more is that they have the facilities to face all surrounding problems and obstacles.","Obstacles that affect daily life, obstacles challenge the younger people, and thus make life more enjoyable rather than depressing them.",1

I always travel in summer with my family. my father, mother, and younger sister usually go to different countries each year. Traveling with my father is much better for us because, he is the tour guide. First of all, travelling with a tour guide will make the trip short and easy, since the tour guide has experience in his place. He will make my vacation more enjoyable. The second reason is that, the tour guide will choose a good place for me better than I do. One time when I went to a new city I asked for a good place to go and how I could go there. At this point I lost the way. So it saves time going with a tour guide who will take me there in a short time. and i do not need to think of time. Finally, first think I could teach my son about travelling is to find a good tour guide.",To save time and show him more places on one trip.,1
323858.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.",From my point of view it is right.,1
653273.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Personally,I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. It is for the following reasons. First,young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people to survive. Second,young people are more self-centred than they used to be. In addition,young people do n ` t be educated to care about their communities. First,young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people to survive. Today,with the economy growing,people have to earn more money to meet their material desires. In order to make a good living,they spend lots of time learning skills. In contrast, in the past,young people had an easy life,they would have more time to care about other people. Second,young people are more self-centred than they used to be. Today,young people are spoiled. Their parents always provide them with a good life. They can easily get anything they want,so they don ` t appreciate the people who take care of them. Therefore,they are becoming more selfish. For example,one of my friends was born and grew up in a wealthy family. He always thinks ""money is the world"". All he cares about is how much money he has. He totally ignored his family,friends and communities.","In addition,young people do n ` t be educated to care about their communities.",1
1076677.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I partially agree with the given statement that ""young people enjoy life more than older people""because young people enjoy life by playing with friends,by watching thelatest movies,by going to colleges,by teasing younger people etc. where as older people enjoy life sitting at home,chatting with the people surrounding them,going to piligrim places etc. Younger people now a days have a lot of fun life to have for example if we consider the case of my brother he enjoys a lot. he goes to college on a bike,he meets friends every day in the evening,he will have a big chat with them about the movies,he then goes to his classmates' house to have a fun time with them about the funny things that happened on that day,finally he comes home and has a good meal and then he goes to sleep. If we take the case of older people they have work to be done,for example if we take the case of my grand mother she is quite relaxed,she usually gathers the other people and she starts chatting the whole day it is a kind ofentertainment for her,she watches old devotional movies with them and enjoysfeeling about god,some times she used to go to piligrim places like tirupathi,shirdi etc. she used to eat the food she wasinterested in ,she used to spend money as she wished. I think both younger people and older people both enjoy life very much but not compared to each other they enjoy it in their own way according to their age.","If we consider the real time facts to better understand this concept we just consider a normal teenage age person who used to go to college or some other jobs they lead their life in a luxurious way thinking that this is the age which is not going to come similarly, if we consider the life of older people they just wanted to enjoy their life in the end days so they enjoy their life as they like and also other peoplewill cooperate for that.",1

208569.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Whether to travel by forming a group or individually has been controversial among many people. However, I basically disagree with the position that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. I have two reasons for my claim. It prevents people from enjoying their personal privacy and enables them to visit only limited places. Most of all, peoplehardly like to enjoy their privacy once they have had a trip by joining a group. As a matter of fact, participating in a package travel needs people to organize it altogether and it is always necessary to have cooperation with strangers. Besides, people are even required to eat their meals at the same places and at the same time. Thus, there is no private time available to enjoy themselves such as walking on the beaches and having some relaxation when they wish to. As a result, traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite disappointed. In addition, it is hard to travel around some places where they want to. Generally, the trip's schedule has already been planned by a tour guide which makes it difficult for people to visit their own desirable places where they always dreamt about. In contrast, by travelling around some countries alone, it will allow people to walk around places and take some photographs and enjoy their holidays. Accordingly, going on a trip individually will be beneficial for people to access diverse places. To sum up, everyone has different opinions on this issue. However, I strongly oppose the view that travelling as a group is better.",This is because it provides a lack of time to have private time and only a few places are able to be visited.,1

375388.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The statement at issue is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Young people are considered the seeds of hopes in a country. Helping the communities not only accumulate young people's personal experiences but expand their visions of the various and nourishing lives. I argue that young people ought to pay more attention to the communities and be willing to spend time helping the communities. Therefore, I fully agree that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping their communities. Here are some reasons why. First of all, due to the flourishing media activities, the grand and big cities are undoubtedly fascinated by young people. They are eager to leave their home towns and build up their own dreams and realize those dreams in prosperous cities. For example, in some developed countries such as Taiwan and Japan , young people enthusiastically move to those grand cities to pursue their future. Only the elderly and the children stay in their communities. Furthermore, the government does not put in practice the education of how and why people should help their communities. Helping the communities looked dumb and unattractive to young people.","They don't know how to help their communities can benefit the community, the whole society and themselves as well.",1
1741422.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops. Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body.","They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool.",1

So it is good that universities force students to study a lot and do conceptual exams. But many of the people that attend university are not young, and for them i think that the lessons have to be more interactive and with facts. Infact they need to match what they are studying with what they have learned from their experience.

1446679.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life.

Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group. However, I personally prefer that when I go in a group, it must be led by the tour guide. Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups. They make some funny statements, and sometimes jokes. Sometimes, the information is real but it is conveyed in a group such a way that everybody laughs. For example, I went to visit a museum, i. e Tajmahal in India. This tajmahal is built by the Sahjaha in love of the wife. Everytime our tour guide asked us what our husband would make for us in future. He said to the man that he would not build this kind of monument which means you donot like your wife.",This is historical truth but the way the tour guides were expressed makes travelling interesting.,1

Of course, choosing the best way to travel is in a group without a tour guide also has advantages to some extents,like we may go by ourselves and get new experiences in that time.","But all of these factors are contemplated, the advantage of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide carrying more weight than those of the best way to travel is in a group without a tour guide.",1
1989288.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I dont agree with this statement that successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than those that only do what they already know how to do well. I think that both things in different ways can bring success to a person's life. Sometimes a person is good at doing something, and they really enjoy doing it, so she/he really puts effort and commits to doing the best they can, and they achieve success doing that. Furthermore, a person that doesn't feel good doing something or feels that they can be better at doing something else should take a risk of trying new things. For example, my Mom was good at her job in a bank, but she felt like she needed a change and so she took the risk of trying to open her own business.","Her dream was to open a spa, which in my country there are few.",1

Now is the best spa in my country, even people from other countries come to mine just to try the spa. What I want to illustrate with this example is that sometimes if you take risks or try new things you could be a successful person, but this is not always the case. Sometimes just doing what you know how to do well, and doing it with effort and being willing to do better, you can also be a successful person. Someone once told me ""Do what you want, but do it right"".

243572.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"On an economy that is based on the selling of products, going from restaurants, to technology products, to simply grocery stores or even real state. To try your best to sell a product is understandable. And nowadays, traditionally in many parts of the world, people will buy products not by the way they taste, of they work, but by the way they look or simply because that is the ""thing"" to buy. Being on the restaurant business, i can't say that i agree or disagree with advertisements making products seem better than what they are. The reason being that i find myself on both sides of the statement. I definitely agree that you have to sell a product for what it is, and don't hide anything, or lie to your customer. But how do you do it when you are trying to sell the best product in the world, but it just does not look good enough for people to buy. I identify myself with both sides of the card, on the one hand, i am the customer, and i want to buy a product, that does exactly what they do when they shoe it on the advertisements , i want to go to a 5 star restaurant and get a 5 star treatment, and a 5 star food. On the other hand, i understand, that if you need to sell a product, you have to find the way to make your customers buy your product. There is nothing wrong with trying to be successful, as long as your advertisements stay as close as possible to the real thing. And there is nothing wrong either with asking for what you paid for.","As long as the customer understands that sometimes advertisements are going to picture things as they are not, people are going to try to push things as they are not.",1

688768.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes I do agree with this statement. In my opinion, when a person invents something new which is not available on the market. He tries to include everything that he could do. This is a good thing. But when the time comes for advertising this product. The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he can get profits as fast as he can. Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones. When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give. Like to give a mobile phone headset, a car charger, a mobile phone carry case, some applications, games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones. When a customer looks at this kind of advertisement he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw in the advertisement. Then the shop keeper shows him, he does not like the item. Why ? Because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones. But they find that they are not original. This causes a lot of problems when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else. I would like to share an example that I experienced a year or two ago. There is a trademark that is really popular among ladies. It sells readymade clothes for women. And his logo is also very popular. A shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost half the price of the material the original shop is selling and he advertised it in various magazines and newspapers. People started buying from him not only keeping in mind that it's the same kind of material.",So this kind of advertising can lose alot of money on just silly things.,1

Second, new technologies develop to substitute cars, such as monorails, private air crafts, and these equipments will be practical immediately. There have been many research efforts to create new transportation which is better than cars, and finally these days, these efforts are gaining their results. For example, many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in ordinary places, because air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars these days. About two years from now, they succeeded in the development, and according to some newspapers, it will be practical in ten years from then.

As time goes by, older people get more experience from their lives and they already have some fierce. So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people. As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people worked for a living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of their lives. Young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is a very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself. Sometimes, he looks like a working robot. I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working has become his routine life. My father has worked hard for the living and he can't stop working even though he is rich enough. I think my father is similar to any older people.

I live in a small city called Erding and also in such a small city a club to help students to get better marks established. I joined this club one year ago and at first I was surprised how many young people were offering their help there.

First, the way of thinking is verifing now, so car makers should produce many kinds of cars to match the people's needs. Some people use theircars only when goingshopping, others use their cars as a kind of hobby. they like support cars, racing cars or off road cars, etc. Today, a typical family living in Japan has one car. But it is said that a typical family living in Japan will have two cars in a few years. one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother. The price of cars has become very cheap because of technology development, a typical family will be able to buy two cars in a few years. In addition, in Japan, we cannot have a second car now because we don't have enough parking space in our home or we cannot pay the expensive parking fee. But these days, Japanese real estates have become cheaper than before. if this situation continues, we will be able to have enough parking space in our home or pay enough parking fees in a few years.","Finally, in Japan, the government improves the railroads and highways by investing a lot of money these days.",1

Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or months you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting. Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You should not be concerned about whether you have enough money either if you have a job or not. It does not matter to you.",On the other hand it really depends on how people have planned theirlives.,1

Those people really do not have a lot of changes in their lives. The time schedule is nearly every week the same. However I know some other people who have a completely different way of life. For example one guy I know, he is 50 years old now, and has stopped working at forty. He has had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on for the rest of his life. So he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world. He works from time to time if he can at a bare in Jamaica, but only one or two months a year.

They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be young is beautiful. If you were a child, you could do what you like without problems. A child thinks nothing about serious events or facts. Old people are under stress or serious.",Young people are always happy.,1

1247584.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I completely agree with the statement ""In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"" because the fact that people like to enjoy more comforts and the improvement thing is that technology is increasing exponentially in everyday life which can make more nu. I support the statement because of the following considerations which i have taken into consideration. The first consideration is that man wants to enjoy comforts and is one of my major considerations. It is because the bikes cannot support the driver in all cases, that is in the rainy season. and the driver wants him which could help him to take him in any atmoshperic condition. this is the first time a person wants to have a car. And the second reason is that it would be safer than bikes because he can keep the temperature of his car according to his will and his comfort while the person riding a bike cannot. And the other reason I would support my statement is the cost of the car. The cost of cars has decreased now a days because of the growth in technology. Now a days, car makers are improving their technology so that the car will of least expenditure, so that there will be more people to buy their car. If we compare the number of cars present 20 years ago and the cars present now we can see that the number of cars hasincreased , a wide variety of cars are now present on the market and also the features the car should have has also improved a lot. Also the lowest cost of the car in these 20 years has been decreased to a major extent.",So I totally support the above statement and I can say conformingly that the rising technology will give the future a better car and also for a cheaper rate so that more people can enjoy the comfort.,1

173637.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only do what they already know. I have specific reasons for my opinion. Which mainly support the idea of success and development. The first and most important reason is, that I strongly connect success with challenge. In order to have success I need to have a challenge. You can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate. He does this every day, without any change. Therefore he has no challenge, because he has done this several times and knows what to do. Without the challenge he can not show success and willn't be recognized by anyone. The second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful. Everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular, new or difficult. In order to do new and difficult things, I need to know my capabilities. These capabilities will need training. Hence if I do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities, I have less possibilities to choose from. Therefore I am limited in the things I can solve. In contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which lead to beingmore successful. The third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful. For example your boss will test you before he promotes you. He will give you things to do that are new to you. For that you will have to take risks to solve these problems. Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful. I had this often in my personal career. My boss tested me and gave me difficult tasks. He was not mainly interested in the result of the task, but how I did it. In conclusion, success needs people to take risks, move to unknown territories and try new things.",Without this there would be a stillstand not for yourself but also in the recognition of others.,1
1037117.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is true that students, today, are really more inclined to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts. Though it is not what is supposed to be can we blame the students? The education system in many countries, itself, requires it to be like that. And today world has nothing to do with the `facts` indeed. in many countries education systems are so restrictive and so close to development and research that students find themselves in an environment which is totally close to the facts. when using textbooks is the only option the students have and when they are expected to be successful in a kind of competition at the end of which the winner takes it all how can we expect the students to possibly try to reach for the facts? the system forges the students to be tend to get the ideas and concepts.

Alternative solutions are found with inventions. So though it may sound strange after looking at the ever increasing sales graphs of the auto companies,I feel there will be fewer cars after twenty years than there are today. Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers. Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call. Retail giants like walmart and food kings like McDonalds are accessible over short distances. These things virtually eliminate the need to go out,drive and shop. With the advent of the internet, it is very much possible to work from home. With means like video conferencing the members of a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe. E-learning has opened new horizons. Classes and even archives are available online. These things help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest, reducing the need to go out everyday. The population is a huge problem faced by many countries as it is linked with limited resources like land. It results in heavy traffic seen on the roads. Most automobiles today run on petrol products which are getting extinct. Also they depend on the political aspects like relations with some oil producing countries.",We can have an alternate solution for that like renewable energy like solar power but the effectiveness of it is still a doubt.,1

997307.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"When I was a little boy, I always thought about "" Why does Uncle Can look sad? "". It was the times that I tried to create new thoughts in my mind and tried to find out why we happened to be alive. Uncle Can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind. I tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic -like I said, I was a little boy then- , which i solved lots of times. However it did not matter how many times I had solved his problems. It just made him create more. Then I understood that it is not just the ""things in his mind"", but there is something more which is socially structured by human beings and our culture. As time goes by, we grow up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society, which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people. When we are talking about society, we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structured situations. In this example that I will give, one may see things more clearly. When I was at elementary school, I just had to pass my courses, then I attended high school, now I had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university. Now I am studying at Bogazici University which is really famous in Turkey. However my missions continue to increase and advance while I am succeeding and going on. This may seem like a story of one. However that is not the truth. The truth is as a human being who grew up, he/she will have more responsibilities which makes us more stressed than yesterday. Why do you think old people love to look at old pictures? It is obvious that he/she wants to be like in the old days, the old days when he/she did not have any responsibilities.",It may seem like only constructed society is to be blamed.,1
626910.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do. First of all i think that young people have something that is frequently not possessed by elderly people ; that is good health. Good health means basically the possibility to travel all around the world and visit exciting new countries. It also means the possibility to practise new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air. For example, it is also necessary to live with dignity. Secondly, young people do not generally have great and impellent responsibilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends, go dancing , practise known sports , stay up late without any problem. Moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems concentrating and remembering the things they learn. This problem can seriously affect their chances to learn new things by reading books, which I believe is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy yourself. Another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which is often lacking in older people. To end up i would like to touch on a very important issue that sadly affects our developed countries.",In several important and crowded cities in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolate apartments or even worse in retirement houses.,1
608718.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,Conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they haven't had too many sad experiences yet. I think that it is ironic since most people want to live longer. But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger. First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously.,Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life.,1
331578.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The question of taking or not taking risks is a controversial one. On the one hand some people think that to be successful they have to try different things. On the other hand, by doing what you already know you may be more efficient and successful because you avoid risk. However, most people have an aversion to the risk, and taking all aspects into account, I strongly feel that it is better to keep doing what you have been used to doing. To start with, it is true that if people do what they already know, they will be specialised in a task and therefore have a real social status. This status is one of the aspects of success. In our modern society, it is important to have a social position in order to be different from other people. Furthermore, most people will agree that nowadays, professionals ask, from their applicants, a specialised profile. At the same time, customers have the same requirement. For instance, most people prefer a specialized doctor rather than a generalist.","Thus, studies are more and more precise.",1
993488.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The statement is about successful people and their attitude to taking risks. I agree with this statement, I think it is true that people who have already reached a successful place in society don't take risks if they're not sure of their success. Why do they act like this? Maybe they don't want to look silly in the eyes of people that are looking at them. If a man is known as a genius at math for example, why should he try to write sentimental poetry or sing in a Broadway musical? He's quite sure that this is going to be a disaster. I think that that's the principal reason why successful people don't even try to do something that is far away from their speciality or that is not really something that they already know.",People usually don't want to try anything new if they're happy with I think that I'll do the same thing if I were in them.,1

1208494.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are two reasons: relief and ease of the guide. To start with, i'm relieved when a tour guide leads us. Because she knows everything example, I travel to a foreign country. If I can not communicate in English and not my mother tongue, I worry about it. I may not be able to listen to a guide and not to see the direction. Then I may get lost. In my case, I traveled in London alone. I have a map and book which has the details about that city. I walked around the city while I looked at the book. But I got lost. I was so nervous because I could not find that there were no japanese and people who could speak Japanese. Then I thought. If I belonged to a tour group by a tour guide, I didn't get lost. Next and the last, a tour guide is the expert of introducing. Because She or he knows the information better than ordinary people. For instance, in this case, it is also a foreign country. Last summer, I went to Italy in a group led by a tour guide. This is my first chance to visit Italy and also the first time to travel guided by a tour guide. I wanted to visit various places, so I often asked a tour guide like this. Where should I go in order to eat dinner at a cheap restaurant? ? or Which place is the best place to go to church? ? A tour guide always told me. And she also told us the history of the city and country. furthermore she showed us the secret place where it is not written in the book.",I felt it was happy to know.,1
439975.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my personal opinion, I agree with the statement, that defines successful people as the person who tries new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know. I consider that successful people share this definition, in the sense, that people that do nt try new things, experiments, or adventures will suspend or shorten out their knowledge, converting them into not successful people and standard people. If you have that spirit of investigating, like in trying new ways of finding certain knowledge, you could consider yourself as a successful person. Another important thing, is that if you are scared of trying new experiments or new methods, that at first could seem rare or odd, you could never have the belief that you are going to succeed in life. If you study history, you could find some examples of scientists like Gramman Bell, Franklin and Mark Twain, who took many risks in their investigation and tried hundreds of times their experiment, here they never settled up. Now their discoveries and their knowledge are recognized world wide, and they were successful and recognized scientists. This scientist never declines in their idea of investigating new things, this characteristic permits them to go beyond the other people that dont try or investigate new things.","Always, when you try a new thing, you have a percentage of failing in what you are doing or of getting your objective, but imagine if you take the risk and invent something that nobody has reached to.",1
417184.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think that to be successful people, people can try new things and take risks much more than doing only what they already know how to do well, but when they become successful they often do only one thing. In fact often the person, who becomes successful, does one thing very very well: he knows how to do something and he does it. For example a successful artist does his work very well. But for some other people that don't have particular abilities, a good way to become successful is to try new things and take risks. But when they know how to do something well, they often only do this thing. This is a pity because this behaviour makes their work so boring and i think that there isn't anything that a person can know completely. In every field there is new knowledge, for example in biology scientists discover a lot of new things every year. Another serious problem is the ""knowledge division"": for example an expert in literature cann't know the common problem of pictures.",Because cultures of people are a damage: every person has to be a bit interested in a lot of things.,1
1055965.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People have a lot of time and energy to do things when they are young. Whatever they do, young people have many more chances to do better than older people. Young people have a lot more possibilities to do enjoyable things. First of all, there are good chances of success doing things when people are young. People who succeeded in their lives usually had busy and tiring but enjoyable lives ; they were motivated and ready enough to do what they were supposed to and wanted to do. Most people who fail in their lives usually regret that they did not use their time efficiently to have enough time to enjoy themselves. Therefore, It is proved from the general lives of people that young people have chances to enjoy their lives.","Also, everyone knows that they can do a lot of things when they are young.",1
1091257.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"There are many things people should know and learn because knowledge is increasing and increasing every day, therefore, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because it can help people to improve their social lives, develop their other skills that they do not know yet, and get good jobs. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who like sports. Even though one does not like sport, he can still talk about sports topics with other people. Because he knows the knowledge of sports, he can create good friendships by communicating easily. Moreover, learning every knowledge might help people to discover their other skills. For example, a doctor always works everyday. One day, she studies dancing, and she feels the dance is her interest. therefore, she has another skill and interest which has a big difference between being a doctor and a dancer. Finally, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is easy to find a better job. Because people have a lot of skills and knowledge required by some companies, they probably can be hired by any companies. For example, there are two people interviewing for a job.","One has broad knowledge, but one has specific knowledge.",1

91268.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life, in several supports and in several ways. To wonder if advertisements make products seem better than they really are could be seen as a nonsense question, because precisely the aim of an ad is to make a product unacceptable. That is why I agree with this statement. Advertisements are made to give people the will to buy the product. It's also the only way to get people aware of a new product, and obviously the better this product is, the more people will buy it, even if it's just to try. So my first point is that advertisements should and must make the product better than they really are, because they're made for that. My second point is that advertisements can do more than just showing a product at it's best. I mean that advertising is also a way to build an image, a spirit for a product and for the people who buy this product. For example, in advertisements for cars, advertisers manage to show only what they want to insist on, in order to attract a specific range of customers. They can insist on security, fun, sport, but it's always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving. So advertisements are a way for producers to sell their products by giving more to the consumers than only the product.","Obviously all people are sensitive to the same propositionsof advertising, and that's a way to highlight the weakness of advertising.",1
1632122.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"For me, as I am one of the young people nowadays, I believe that we should give enough time to helping our community. I would like to introduce our works for our community. In school we are asked to do voluntary work for an exact amount of time. According to my knowledge I believe every school has the same amount of time to do volunteerwork. Our school has to do more than 20 hours of volunteer work for 3 years of junior-high school. This may feel that we are foreced to do it, but even though we are forced to do volunteering, I say we eventually help out the community. Young people nowadays don't only spend time helping their community but also spend a lot of time helping their country. Korea is a small country with no fossil fules or what so ever. The only resource that can help Korea to keep on going to the top would be students' or young people's intelligence. A few days ago I found out that not even Japanese students study as hard as we do. What I also knew was that Korea's students had higher grades in math and science than other countries' students. Many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now. As  a result of this, many parents in Korea's young people are making their children work harder than any bodyelse. for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on. According to my opinion, I think young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities.","Although helping by volunteering which is forced to do from school, I believe young people do realize they are helping out their community.",1

193664.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Who enjoys life more young people or old people. It is very important for us to enjoy our time in our life span owing to the fact that we feel positive and happy if we only enjoy our time. People often claim that young people enjoy life more than old people however I am inclined to believe that,old people can enjoy just the same level or more/I have many reasons to believeso. To start with according to me young people have a good time which is true they do not have many responsibilities ,they can do many sports,ride their bikes and the like but they are also in terms of their education. I think that this is a very hard time in someone's life they have to obey therule,to be disciplined which can be gloomy and sad. In this term of their life they do not have the opportunity to choose what they want. They are in control of their parents or their teachers. According to me,adults have the ability to choose what they want to do which is the most significant issue according to me. Fredom is something which we enjoy in life naturally and instinctually. In particular, if we choose a job that we tend to like, I can not see any reasons why we can take an adult to be unhappy Taking everything in to account,i strongly believe that adults can also enjoy their life just as young ones do or much more by choosing the right job and controlling themselves.","Working, earning money and spending it on something they enjoy.",1
364007.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people. This agreement is based entirely on my own experience and common sense. To demonstrate what I believe, I would like to state some views here. Every time I meet young people, I feel an air of freedom. They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers. They may have little knowledge or even be non-educated, but they have desires to explore the new world. Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there. All these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads young people to be higher, stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people. Another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth. Because of the limitations of age, the old lose lots of enjoyable things. They may be rich and healthy, but they do not have interests in nice food; they can buy a great variety of clothes, but they do not have good looks. Apart from their elders, the young take advantage of a nice age. No matter what clothes they put on, they seem to be active and handsome. They do not need to worry about blood pressure while having delicious pizzar or other fast food. Life begins with good food.","In conclusion, I admit that there are negative points to young people.",1

We can hardly see a young person helping an old granny to cross the road nowadays, because we prefer chatting with friends beside the roads. I do not really know South African young people's behaviour, but i know young people in China very well. Of course, not all of us are selfish and unconcerned, but the majority of young people are selfish. They are everywhere, in the school, on the street and even just in our families. Unfortunately, i think that i am one of them too. i remember when i was in the schools of China.","We need to do the daily cleaning everyday by ourselves, because that is and still is a part of our school duties.",1
935619.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The question has been asked whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for them to learn facts. In my opinion, understanding is definitely more important because it gives the students a chance to explore, a chance to be creative and an unforgettable result. Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topic allows students to go through the investing process. For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literature and find out for themselves that certain techniques add to the perfection of writing. Understanding how they work would give students a better lesson. Getting the concepts and ideas also provides students with a chance to be creative, especially when dealing with are. What kind of art class would it be without studio work? Students should be offered to get creative with colours, textures, moods and all sorts of things. Who cares if they fail once in a while? New creations found in the process of real understanding. Years after years, it is not the definition that students remember, but the unforgettable experience that they learned. Giving out the facts does not provide students with a lot of thoughts of their own. By understanding the ideas and concepts, students gained the ability to conclude the facts themselves. Even if they forget about the facts, they will be able to ""reproduce"" them. Facts are the devil that limited imagination and understanding.",Thomas Edison would be able to invest without knowing the ideas and concepts of science very well.,1

What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean,so it is impossible to pursue in many acedamics. The better way is to take a single subject. We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field. He gets the skills of innovation , works hard ,and tries to concentrate on his subject. since he is free to choose the subject of interest he will pursue with zeal and eagerness. He will be more clear about his future plans.","There was a saying that"" jack of all,master of none"".",1

182182.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement. I have three reasons why I'm support the statement. First, it is natural to make products seem much better than they really are. The advertisement is about the economy. So, making products seem much better is natural. Please imagine. For example, food. If the advertisement for food doesn't look delicious, Most people will not buy it because it seems to taste bad. Then, the economy doesn't work. Nobody buys it, then, the products disappear. The reason why most people buy the product is influenced by the advertisement. At least, in Japan, most people are influenced by advertising. In fact, I'm one of them. Second,advertisement is a competition between many companies. How can they make people buy them or how can they make their products look good. It is true that the product which I bought was bad. However,it shows how the advertisement has a big influence. Finally, you know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. You should remember them.",I think making presents seem much better is a bad thing.,0
18690.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting. A specialist is the man who soeciallyizes in more than one subject. The famous English detectives in the novels are good at detective and music. Such examples can be seen in every day life. A man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so.",Though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing.,1

Firstly, taking a sports man in to consideration he should adopt some new methods to improve his skills in his game rather than trying for some other games. so here the sports man is suggested to carry his carrier on the same field without going to other fields and taking risks. On the other hand ,let us see how success comes from new things. For example,white brothers invented aeroplanes as they were new to the world they were praised by the world. And later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplanes are not so much praised as the white brothers. This is because the basis and the idea is given by the white British and the others have just made some modifications. Those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extent that the white brothers got. the people who follow the procedure given by others may not get success as much as the people who give the basic idea.",we should note that going for new things gives success but it may or may not be changing the field of interest.,1

This type of skills will improve the ability to study and the ability to remember. These skills also reduce the study time. the students can learn more in a format quickly. Learning facts is good but every time we dont want to study. We dont want to sparemuch time on learningfacts. At that time these skills are very helpful. It is a very time consuming process. Understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful any time. for example i want to go to anexam ,first i will go through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and the concept of that one. I regularly follow this rule of studying. So in this way i get more information in time ,i save my time also. In this way, I am studying hard to get good marks in my exams.

1120670.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Everyone learns a lot of facts in life. Humans learn the whole life and are always improving ways to get a larger knowledge. While studying everyone should decide about the level of deepness about a certain academic subject. The knowledge could be useful, but a lot of times it happens that it doesn't have any purposes in real life. For some academics it is important to learn a huge amount of knowledge and it is easier for them to get an overview of information while making a decision. These people need jobs with tasks like combining different aspects for a certain problem. For instance, a manager who has to check out all kinds of consequences for a problem. A basis for this is to have broad knowledge to find the best solution to the problem. Another example could be a doctor who cares for general sicknesses. He has to know about several looks of diseases to offer a quick help in a proper way. Sometimes it is also important to have a specialist on a certain subject who is able to solve the problem faster than someone who has just an general idea of the subject. For instance, a doctor in a hospital which is specialised in cancer. He would be able to help with a professional look at some cells without reading a book first or fulfilling some experiments. Both ways of studying are good ways to find a profession, because in reality either way is necessary. It depends on the subject and the profession. For me it would be more interesting to have a large amount of knowledge and to get in touch with different fields of academic subjects.","Combining different ideas, aspects and theories sounds very motivating.",1

And in addition, today, having a car, is also to be part of the social world, to be autonomous. However, You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear. When you see the fast evolution of all the other ways to be driven. Furthermore, lots of people prefer public transport as a cheaper way to go to work, and governments understand this and are developing this, like in hong kong, where you can do everything without anycar, or in London, where the city doesn't allowany car. Or even in strasbourg where the french government make cheaper tickets in order to encourage people to let their car at home. In addition, we can not plan clearly in which way the world will evolve. If you take as an example a developed country, because it's the one who will be more affected by this matter, you can already tell how they already try to develop other ways to move in and outside of their country. Take as an example, the train development and the decrease in the price in some companies helped by government.","In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of cars on the road in twenty years, in my opinion, I can say I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road, this due to the evolution of the population.",0

876354.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide. When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do.",But any group in this situation would be disappointed.,1

1000235.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree that successful people will try new things and take risks than doing the things they already did well for the following reasons First, The people who are successful are well experienced and have different ways to approach things to solve their problems since they already know what is good and what is bad from their experience and knowledge they have gained. for example scientists who come up with new innovations in this present world are very imaginative in inventing new things rather than working on the same thing again and again for example Thomas edison has undergone a great struggle in inventing the bulb if other scientists worked on the same research then we wouldn't enjoy other pleasurable things that made our life easier and quicker in this world like the invention of aeroplanes,cars,computers etc.",",.",1
1300821.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with this statement. I think that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important for several experiences. Also, it is useful in several situations. First of all, I think that people who have knowledge about anything are respected by other people. If the teacher knows not only English but also science, when he or she is asked by his or her students, he or she can answer smoothly. And, they can answer their question. In my case, my English teacher has knowledge of anything. For example, he knows about the art, the history of the living, and the lives of other countries' tribes. When I talked with him about these subjects, I was surprised and thought that I could learn various things from him as my teacher. I can ask the question that I can't answer , and everytime, he responds tomy question. Therefore, I respect him because he is intelligent. In addition, if people know that, they can use their knowledge anytime. For example, when they are forced to write an essay about the subjects that I mentioned before, they can write it without researching. They don't have to waste time investigating or asking others. Moreover, even if they research into them, they know the basic things, so they can improve their knowledge from other information. In my experience, when I had to research to write the essay about the problem about Yasukuni Shrine because I had no idea about that. At that time, I regretted that I didn't have the knowledge. If I knew about the problem, I could write the essay more deeply or effectively. In summary, I think that it is a good thing for them to have knowledge about various subjects.",One reason is they can be praised for their intelligence when they can answer the question from other people.,1

1907556.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. That is true. That is the way they sell their products, because people always want to buy better products. And the advertisements know it, so they make the products look better to sell them. First, the advertisements have to sell their products, so they try to explain about their products. Then they do not want to tell disadvantages about their products, they just want to tell advantages of them. In the process, they sometimes have to cover the disadvantages. So they tell other people about their products being overly good. And other people believe what they say, and think about what they heard. People will think that the product is really good because they did not hear about its disadvantages. A good looking is tasting good. As for products, it is really important how they look. If they look good, then they seem to work better or taste better than how they are. So when people make the products, they make them look better to cover customer's eyes. And other people would believe that the products are better than they really are because they are looking good, believing looking good is better than looking bad. These days, people care so much about the products' appearance.","For example, there are many different types of vending machines.",1

1928452.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially those who would like to make a success in their life, discuss whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just keep what they already have a knowledge to make a better life. I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life. For example, the SamSung company which is specialized in the electronic field such as TV, computers and semiconductor products worldwide has been researching new markets and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result, it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people. If the company still enjoyed stability, today's successful story would not exist. Further more, the companies which exploit the well of crude oil always try to find new resources by investing large amounts of money with huge risks. For these efforts, it deserved to get a lot of reputation and accumulate a fortune. Secondly, stability of today's life means returning to the past in this capitalism. Everyday, new information is revealed to the public and every individual must have a radar to catch it.","For example, the auto maker company tries to new design to meet the customers' needs in the market However, they do not make an effort to make a new design of cars, the company will lose the people's consumption.",1
115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it.","I also like it, I learnt several new rules about sport, so it encourages me to play it.",1

1945210.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisement is the art of convincing people and making them believe in the story told. Generally these stories are about products with ""great"" specifications, so I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Mostly in advertisements small tricks are utilized to attract the consumers' attention to the desired field. For example , the information about a campaign (which can be considered as a product in an advisers' aspect) is written in very small paragraphs compared to the puntos of the slogan and many people do not even see them until they buy the product. Additionally , advertisers mostly exaggerate the good points of the products. In particular, in electronic devices one can observe this fact. After buying an electronic device it usually does not satisfy the consumers' high expectations since it is not as good as it is written (or announced). Generally type of slogans saying "" Never such a resolution before"" or "" Great sound quality , better than any other product on the market"" make people expect incredible efficiencies that would never be true. On the other hand , precautions taken to prevent this kind of trick which leads people wrong prove the existence of such a manipulation. It can easily be observed that after these precautions , such as laws, taken advertisements became to the point and they started to give up such tricks ,as mentioned above, like invisible information and superior specifications. To sum up , advertisers are doing their job which is convincing people( or manipulating people ) although the precautions taken and they will find other ways to deceive people.",As stated above it is their creativity and the markets' requests from them.,1

1147723.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The issue is whether it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one particular subject. I believe it is very difficult to answer this question, because there are many aspects which speak for booth of them. I think having a specialization in one specific subject is important for a special job, like chemistry. It will help you to be good at this work and to have the knowledge. A boss in a firm or company would search for this special knowledge and i think you will have a good chance to get this job. The special knowledge is very useful for you and you are an expert in a special subject. People would ask you for help and you are able to give a answer, because you are well educated in this subject. But on the other hand you should have broad knowledge, because you have the chance to get a better job and people will respect you. In my view you have a better chance with a broad knowledge of a lot of academic subjects to get a good job in this world today. You have a better spectrum of knowledge and I think it will help you a lot. I think knowledge is power and that is very important.

The advertisements always look really good and make people want to spend money on them. In my opinion, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are the owners want to earn money, and the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated. The first reason is because the owners want to earn money from these commodities. For instance, if the advertisements look really terrible, no one would want to buy them and spend their money on them. Therefore, the owners willn't get any money and welfare from them. Secondly, most of the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated. For example, the iPOD is really fashionable these days. The iPOD advertisements always say that it can contain over 1,000 songs and won't run out of batteries at least 14 hours. However, after I spent my money that came from my salary for a part time job, I was really sad about that. My iPOD ran out of batteries before 8 hours, and it had no more space before I put in the three hundred and fifty-third song. Therefore, I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following reasons.",The owner wants to earn money and the advertisements are always decorated and exaggerated.,1
790700.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"LIFE IS FOR YOUNGERS When it comes to a question like who enjoys life most, then the answer seems to be obvious. Of course; young people enjoy life more than older people for several reasons. First; I can say that young people have more free time than old people. Therefore ; this means that they have more time to spend on their hobbies and favorite sports. They have a chance to do whatever they want whenever they want to, such as leisure activities. For example; young people dont have to take care of children , clean the home and cook for dinner. However; older people have to spend some time on all of these things. Second; having a joyful time in life is more related to age. Young people have more energy than older people. They are more energetic and physically active as compared to older people. This enables young people to get more enjoyment from life. They can go to mountains for climbing , go for skiing and go for diving. However; older people may not do all these activities since they may not be able to find enough energy to do them. Therefore; this makes them not get much joy from life. Finally ; it is more related to the psychology of people. Since young people have much more curiosity than older people ; they have an eagerness to discover new things. Young people try to get as much info as they can get from their environment. Therefore; they have much more tendency to enjoy life most. In contrast; older people would not be in a mood to look for something new.","Since they get a lot of experience from life, they may never find enough interest to already discovered issues.",1

They prefer to live in safety. That's why they do not want to change their conditions. But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves. There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some people think that they are only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. Through these experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his internship. He worked as a worker in a building. During his internship, he experienced and learnt how he could build a strong building. Now he has his own company which is related to building structures.","Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well.",1
715272.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"For some people, you will succeed in your life just by taking risks. And it is right, in a certain way. In fact, our society shows admiration for these kinds of people. But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank. According to me, it is a lack of consciousness, especially when you are in charge of a family.",This argument is far from being useless.,1

Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies. On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them.

1156164.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I agree with the statement given here that ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guide"" My first reason is,as we go to a new place,we may not know how the place will be,how the behaviour of the people will be,what their culture is,what their customs are etc. If we go to some american countries,we may find some difficulty ,understanding their language and also we cannot understand their accent eventhough they speak english. For example suppose you planned to go toFrance. The language the people speak there is French. You may not understand French. Here you need a guide. My second reason is,if the place you planned to tour is a historic place without a guide,you finally end up with the crooked structures you saw there. As each historic place has a history behind its main purpose is to know its history. As we are not familiar with the place and its history,a guide is the right person to explain it. For example,take the instance of mahabalipuram,a famous historic site in India. It's all filled with temples made ofrock, carrying on stone etc. We need a guide to explain what rocky scenery is like.

The current techniques are getting more complicated and the competition is getting more intense as time goes on. Therefore, it is more likely to be recommended to devote a specific field of study or work and to be highly qualified in it. First, the current field of research, such as computer science and electronic technology, which dominate the development of a current society, need very deft and highly qualified skills and knowledge. These fields of products change actually every minute. The cellphone which was produced early this year is already outmoded and a 2-year-old laptop is not producing anymore. Moreover, it is getting common to access the Internet with phones and laptops everywhere, and I can do whatever I want, like watching TV, movies, or chatting on line with my friends. Therefore, intensive and specialized skills and knowledge in electronic and mobile technology are desperately needed these days.

Ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete. Concepts can be altered , modified or even proven to be false. A fact would be, what goes up must come down. That is a proven fact.

Observing their works and characteristics, most of them are challengers, who always like to try different things from others and like to invent something new that no one has ever thought of. If they believe that one project that has been planned very well based on their planned strategy through their experiences and collaborations co-works, they are not afraid of taking risks of loosing their fonds. I have a friend that has been working for the health sector which specializes in HIV/AIDS for many years in the world. I would like to say that she is a sufficiently successful person, considerate in her profession and her economic status that can live on her own.

1165565.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"The answer to this statement depends on personal life experience and different cultural background. Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. However, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone rather than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conspicuous aspects as follows. The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guides lead you to and have no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get access to the local people' s life and culture. Through talking and living with them, you can have different cultures and perspectives on life. That will only present you with a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world. there is another reason deserving some words here. Travelling in a group led by a tutor is a waste of money in some conditions. Because the guide depends on the money you spend on the trip to survive.",They usually convince the traveller things that have no value become necessities and buy them.,1

1244220.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons. Firstly, if a person is focused on a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge, because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field. Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people to know many things from a superficial view; it is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field. I can concide that broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff.

1067059.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the statement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than going for many. Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail.

297801.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I disagree with "" The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. ""Tour guides usually offered you a tight schedule which meant you were in a hurry all the time, and therefore you could not enjoy yourself much on your trip. A tour guide usually planned your schedule tightly from the early morning to midnight. You could seldom enjoy yourself as you were too busy moving from one attraction to the other attraction. I think most people have experienced it before. While you wanted to stay a bit longer at one attraction, the tour guide would tell you to go back to the shuttle bus and you could just stay at that attraction for a maximum of 30 minutes. You were not able to understand deeply about the real life of that country or the attraction because you would not have enough time to explore it by yourself. You needed to be prepared for a long and boring explanation before you could visit the attraction. You also needed to wake up early in the morning for the full schedule for the whole day and you would be able to go back to your hotel at midnight. The schedule offered by the tour guide was not always suitable for your own habits. Maybe you didn't like roller coasters but they would take you to the most famous theme park in that country. And you would be staying in the theme park without playing anything except looking at your groupmates playing happily for the whole afternoon. Led by a tour guide would also disable you to plan your own schedule. You might not be able to visit the places that you wanted to because that place was not on the schedule offered by the tour guide. You would have less fun during your trip. Travelling in a group was not a good thing. People needed to stay with a group of strangers for the entire trip and arguments would usually appear when they had different views on different things. Also, travelling in a group led by a tour guide is also costly, as you need to pay a fee for the services provided by the tour guide. You have to pay for a trip that you were not enjoying so much. To conclude, i disagree with "" The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.",""".",1

412217.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There seem to be a lot of reasons, I think two reasons are the most reasonable; short of time due to studying and selfish minds. First, these days young people are usually students or rookies. They have to study and work all day long and even during weekends, so they can not pay attention to their communities. Moreover their parents urge them only to make good grades in school and make a success in companies rather than mull over the problems of society or find the ways to contribute to communities as members of society. Second, young people are being raised in affluent circumstances these days.

There are two reasons. First, it makes people who do not have broad knowledge oto have difficulties in the company or society. When we get jobs or enter schools, we have opportunities to talk with many people. At the time, However, we have only one specific knowledge, for example, knowledge about mathematics, we can speak only about mathematics. It has the possibility of giving other people the impression that you are a boring person. It is very dangerous and we may not be able to lead nice our lives in society. Second, studying one specific subject makes your future very narrow. For example, when the person who has been studying mathematics in order to be a professor changes his or her mind and the person wants to be an animal doctor, what should the person do? He or she has knowledge only about mathematics so he or she can not change his or her future job now. A person who has studied only one specific subject can not change or decide their future again once they decide their future in their childhood.","In conclusion, specializing in one specific subject has dangerousness possibilities in deciding of the futures.",1

In life we need to enjoy every part, though it is related to money, adventure, drama etc. Elders are always frightened as they always think of the future rather than the present. But youngsters are really bothered about the future. For example when i am at school i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me, but finally they sent me with more caution. After comming back, they saw my video of my bangee jump on tour and started scolding me though i safely came back. They are always more curious in life and they never try for any adventure. I feel adventure is also part of enjoyment. Spending money is economy for elderly people but for young people money doesnt matter for enjoyment. when i started earning, i started spending for my own expenses, like restaurants, outings with friends, enjoying weekends, but my parents did nt like this as they wanted me to save money for my future.

It often happens that we become completely blind when we are buying something. Infact we buy some product only because we have seen it on television even if we really do not need it. I can say that because it also happens to me. Two days ago watching the television I decided to buy a practical product useful for making sport because it helps you to get back your energies after the physicaleffort. I play basketball with my friends during the weekend, first of all during the saturday afternoon and we play for four or five hours long. That is why I needed that product but I bought it even if I did not know what it was composed of. I think that this system is very dangerous because the product controls are not accurate and the final consumer is always the one who risks.

However, it is difficult to spare time for a trip. In this situation, I would prepare the trip before going to travel. That's why I do not need a tour guide for sightseeing. I would read, ask and research about this place where I am going to visit. I spent this tour guide fee for extra service at hotels or another service. In addition, my time there is really limited. I do want to visit places which I really want to go to. I can not control my schedule when I travel in a group. I will miss some of them if I go with the group tour.

In my view, it can't be avoided for companies to make products seem much better than they really are in their advertisements. There are so many advertisements in the world and companies want people to be interested in their products. Besides, to make interesting advertisements, they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points. First, most advertisements are made to grab people's eyes. For example, we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on TV. However, they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences. But every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently from others, because they need to grab people's eyes. And it will be connected right away with their selling.

For example, I learned many subjects from academic institutions such as history, nuclear  physics, and pantam physics. But i am the president of an online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me.

669962.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Have you ever an uncomfortable feeling, when you watch the mass media because of news? There is so much news and new information in mass media such as newspapers, TV, radio. Sometimes, we should think about whether it is true or not. Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For the person who wants to know, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point. Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product. For instance, as you know, fast food is not good for your health. However, the companies which produce fast food, they usually hide the fact which can cause problems for the body like cancer. In particular, for children, they can be addicted to fast food because they just see the advertisement which looks delicious.

345389.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When students study, they need to understand what they study, rather than learning the facts of it. Because, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful to understand problems much deeply, much easier to memorise, and much more acceptable for other problems that they have faced. first, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful for students to understand what they study better than facts. When students start to understand the idea and concept of certain questions, they will find what was the cause, and how it works. It's like grapes. All the teeth of guiers are matching perfectly the machine works. Therefore, to understand what they are studying deeply, then they need to understand what the idea of it is. Second, understanding of ideas and concepts will be in students' minds a longer time than learning facts. Because, there are lost of facts in all single questions. If students start to study facts, then they have to memorise all of the facts which is a bigger number than ideas and concepts. Lots of facts can be found in lots of similar type of questions However, those are similar questions, so if the students remember only one idea or concept, then they will be able to solve all of thequestions, instead of remembering all of the factors for each question. Therefore, understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts, so that will remain in students' brains for much longer. Third, ideas are much more appealing than facts when they have some other problems. When they understand the idea, they will follow on that idea and stick to lots of thinking and reach a much further idea and study more widely. However, the facts are too certain, narrow. Also it cannot be changed, like a stone. None of the branches can stick on a stone, so students will know how to get a bird with the stone, but will not know how to play 'catch ball' with the stone.","Therefore, figuring out and understanding ideas will be much harder for application for other things and will be much more useful when they face some other new problem.",0
1404823.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The thesis that there are fewer cars in use than today can be discussed controversially. Many points have to be considered in the global progress of economy, culture and maybe even events you cannot calculate with. In my opinion the number of cars in twenty years will most probably increase. There are different reasons why. The economy tries to sell more cars and did very well in the last decades. So I wouldn't expect them to work less effectively during the next twenty years. The trend goes to more consumption and the automobile sector is huge in a time when flexibility and local independence are wanted from companies. Also the basic for driving a car, petrol, is secured for the next hundred years. That makes it even more unlikely that a branch will increase its production. One actual topic is interesting when I consider it might be the way that fewer cars will be produced. Global warming is so impressively aware in recent years, e. g megatornados or wide spread floodings caused by melting poles, that people might be led to think about another way of being mobile. I can imagine that a new kind of car will come, hybrid cars, that will have another source of energy where exhaust will be pure water. That saves nature from acidic rain caused by carbondioxide. Under these circumstances the number of cars will increase. I am just not sure how long it will take to establish a new lobby for these kinds of cars, a lobby that has more power than the oil lobby today. At the moment car dealers have problems selling their cars, on the other hand there are more and more other car brands on the open market (globalisation). The result is that prices fall. With lower prices more people can afford to buy a car.","And so the will, I guess.",1

Some people might say the young generation would like to help their communities, since they can experience a variety of things. However, in my opinion, it seems clear that young people do not give enough time to helping their community; they are too busy and they are affected by biased information. First, young people have too much work to do. It is generally agreed that as society is getting more complex, young people are too busy developing themselves. Therefore they would not have much time to care for their communities, For example, one of my friends likes to do a favor to others so he got a prize from the principal of his school. However, since he has to prepare for applying to the university he wants to go to, he cannot give enough time to helping other people. In this way, being busy is a great obstacle to helping our communities.","Second, as far as multi-media is concerned, young people are only concerned about themselves.",1
1730743.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","No,i firmly contradict the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Cars are used for the purpose of travelling from one part to the other and they are considered luxurious and the most important medium of travelling. So ,we can expect a development in technology to provide more and more cars which will have very good mileage and will be comfortable with seats and their pick-ups,instead of a decline in their numbers in the next twenty years. Say for example,there were old fashioned maruti cars (maruti 800,maruti van) and ambassador cars in the 1980s but with the recent development in the technology of cars (like the maruti suzuki swift,scorpio,TATA indica), it has improved the vehicles capability very efficiently. That is accepted by more individuals that fewer and fewer cars will be seen on the roads in the next twenty years. So revolution is in all fields and also in automobile engineering ,so that research will make better cars in future and the purchasers will purchase them and so more cars will be seen. Another important example is that the busyness of the big cities is increasing day by day. So,we can say that there are more and more cars seen on the roads as it was seen twenty years ago and so the predictions are accepted with evidence. From the point of view it is seen that the city gets heavily polluted due to carbon monoxide and smoke which is more and more enforced into the air by vehicles but the increase in the number of vehicles is the obvious thing from this point of view,and the most important factor from thisincrease in the number of cars,purchased by the people and run on the road with more and more in number day by day.","So,I support the development of technology,So I, not only support the increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years, but firmly agree with it.",1

Starting a new business for example is such a risk. You might think you will regret it when you fail this experiment. But if you don't even try it, you can't find out, whether you will be successful or not. Furthermore, taking risks means learning new things and getting more knowledge, which is important for finding a good job or remaining in it. Because a more interesting employee is an employee who works hard and is able to switch into many sections. Unless you can sometimes lose, when risking too much, it is a chance to create something new, never being indicated before. And this will cause you a lot of fame and success. To conclude, taking risks developed important ideas and discoveries, that wouldn't have been found out, if there had n't been some brave people who tried them out.",For thi.,1
216699.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago. The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need.","I was kind of addicted to television home shipping a few years ago, the seller in the homeshopping mentioned what kind of people need their product.",1

The first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people, and (even if i'm not so old) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than younger  people. We all remember the first time , the first time we made love, the first time we went to highschool, the first time we smoked a cigarette. I think this is one of the reasons we might say younger people can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders, just because everything they do is known. Teenage years are the period where you have lots of experiences, it's an adventure, you discover all the time. I remember my teenage years. It was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i've experienced during this period. i was always going to partys, when i was 15 me and my friend would go to a night club and everything had an important impact on me because it was known. An other argument is that young people have no responsibility : they don't have money problems, or job problems or even children's problems , Their parents take care of everything so they don't have to worry about all those things that make life difficult. But in contradiction with all that i said before, i would point out that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way. adults have a larger experience which gives them a knowledge young people don't have. Having this experience they can appreciate things young people wouldn't even care about. It's hard for me to give examples because i don't consider myself as a complete adult.

It means more knowledge brings more power. I strongly agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better. There are some reasons why having broad knowledge of academic subjects is better because of application in other fields and various experiences.

Young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their youth and things that are available to young people. First, in my opinion, young means full of energy, especially in physical conditions. Most young people have the best or better body conditions than older people. These conditions make people able to do many things like studying, playing sports, drinking alcohol etc. For example, when sportsmen get old nearly 40, they usually retire because their physical conditions are not strong enough to continue that job. Moreover, when people get older, they keep on destroying their brain cells whether they want to or not. Thus, young people can enjoy their life more than older people do because they are mostly healthier than old people. Second, when people are young, there are so many opportunities for them. Limitation to older people on the rollercoaster can be a good example of that.","Because of young people, young people can try many things even though they fail a lot.",1

This decision should be well thought by everyone. If we want to have a perfect world we should dedicate ourselves very hard to the subject we like. In my opinion, when somebody finishes his or her career and has the doubt of having a master's in that subject or studying another thing to broaden his or her knowledge, the decision should be the first one mentioned.

I have three different points of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually. First, if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, of course you don't have to plan anything because the tour guide knows everything about what to do or where to go. It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group. When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended.","I am sure a tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat, but you have no choice but to eat something else.",0

You could not believe somethings which happenedToday. So Young people are changing also, they enjoy their lives more than older people do. There are three points that can prove this. First,young people will not think about when they become old what will happen. They just want to enjoy their lives now. For Older people ,there is a big difference. Older people will think about their family, their retirement payments, their future lives. They will save money for that. They will also reduce their ativities for health.

If you learn the facts without an accurate concept, you may hear you are smart at first. But eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of facts will collapse. Second, I think you should experience the proper process. Everything has an order in process. Understanding concepts is a start. So you can't understand further facts without them. If you skip something , you will meet trouble in the end. Speaking again, If you ignore the process of understanding accurately, you will find you didn't even know an easy thing. Third, you should understand the academic thing as a whole. All the stories and facts link together.",You should understand something through another thing.,1

136109.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth. It's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products. But sometimes,the products really disappoint clients. For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it. But only after some days,I found the shoes hadn't got a good texture and were destroyed by walking.","Then from these advertisements,I take a lesson:Don't believe adversisements! When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive,it means in other aspects,maybe they are controversial.",1
836337.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In general I think that both understanding conceps and learning facts are the two faces of the same medal. I will try to explain here below all the connections between concepts and facts especially in science terms. All the big scientific discoveries depend on the observation of facts, but on the other hand it is important to know all the theories related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of the facts we are observing. To give an order to this matter I think that first (in a temporary order, not for its importance) students need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts, so in the first part of students' formation it is necessary for them to learn as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the matter and after they can understand and remember much more easily all facts connected with their studies. for example if you are studying the atomic structure, of course you need to know everything about chemistry and related theories. This example feats quite well to this essay, especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission.","It happened that the woman, who was of course a physicist and had studied a lot of theory, was observing the facts about accelerated neutrons pushed against the nuclear part of a not stable atom.",1
1455975.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is usually said that people should focus on only one specific subject to succeed. However, contrary to this opinion, I strongly believe that people who live in modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects. The reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who has a variety of knowledge. Moreover, if someone focuses only on one specific subject, he or she might be biased without balance. First of all, I strongly believe that people who are living in this period should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others. When it comes to biotechnology, people are eager to think that it has no relationship with philosophy at all. However, when I watched some SF movie, 'Island', I was deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives, so called global projects , which are reasonable and ethical. It is a problem of philosophy. This example shows that these two academic subjects are very similar to each other. Secondly, If someone commits only on only one specific subject, he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balance. This is because I believe that academic areas originated from one subject, which was not divided like now. As society began to be divided and specialized, academic subjects began to be separated too. However, nowadays, there are new tries to combine the separated academic areas for more academic progress. For example, to cure patients, doctors are working with sociologists because the reason that patients suffer from disease comes from not only health problems, but also social problems such as too much stress and environmental pollution.","In sum, without any hesitation, I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects than to specialize in one subject, All in all, academics in one.",1

141650.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it depends on the age of the student. For young students, like secondary and high school it will be more important to know about ideas and concepts. Students at this age are still at the beginning stage or we can say learning state. They will learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future. They may even learn from what is happening in history. By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results. This will be a worthwhile experience for students For example, they are two kinds of cost in production, fixed and variable cost. Fix cost should not be changed at any sum of productions. But when we increase or quantity any certain level, the fixed cost will change. Thus, ideas or concepts and facts support each other. Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts. Because some of the facts may come from ideas or concepts. The plane that can fly is a fact.",How the plane can fly came from the concept of researchers in their good calculations when making the plane.,1

Some think that doing what they already know how to do well is better, contrary to those who think that trying new things and taking risks is more important to be successful. In my opinion, I personally agree with the second idea. These are the following reeasons. First of all, taking risks is important to struggle with the difficult life conditions. For example, some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging, cycling. Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them. However , if people want to enjoy life more and be more healthy , they should try new and risky sports. They shouldn't be afraid of them doing risky sports. In addition to this, taking risks is a fundamental issue because of the experience of life more deeply. For instance, i always do the most difficult tests first at school. Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it. Although it means taking risks, i prefer to do it and anytime i am not in a bad situation. Therefore, it is really beneficial. Last but not least, taking risks is also important to see which we can do the best. For example, a footballer prefers to run not too long in the exercises. While he is doing that he doesn't know if he runs very long distances, after that he can be better athis job.",Thats why it is important.,1

1357482.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. First, we always choose the same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to the supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys the same snack. One day, I asked him, "" Why do you choose the same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watch this snack's commercial on television, then I think that this snack tastes good, so I always choose this one. ""I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he is influenced by television commercials , so he always chooses the same snack. Second, we always believe in the content of commercials. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food. My father asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy expensive natural food? ""My sister answered,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food. ""However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there was a lot of value in her natural food, but it was the same as normal food.

130222.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays more and more young people don't care about their livingcommunities. They spend a lot of time on their studies in school or in a cream school. Even if they have free time they may use it for their entertainmentactivities, like going shopping with friends or family. Although there are still some young people who have paid some attention to their communities, it is my belief that they don't give enough time to help their communities. The first reason that causes young people ton't n't devote more time to their communities is the high competitive pressure in the education system. Their parents wish their child could get good grades in different subjects that cause them to need to attend different courses. Even in the day time from school, they need to take some courses in the cram school to do some supplements. In addition, while they have free time after the hard work in their studies. They usually use it to do some activities, like see a movie or sing the song on the KTV with their classmates or friends. Furthermore, due to the busy work of their parents which causes the fathers and mothers to n't have much time to educate their kids, not to mention teaching their kids to do something helpful to their communities. So from a point of view, if we want to encourage young people to do more in our communities, we need to make more effort in our education. Firstly, we need to encourage parents to take their children to attend some activity in our community.",Let these young people know more about their society.,1

Obviously the two major kinds of people are the younger and the older. What everyone wishes to do is to enjoy their life and i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life when compared to the old. First, younger people have very few responsibilities in their life when you compare them to that of an older guy. An old man usually keeps thinking about his family and his responsibilities. He got to sacrifice many of his pleasures for the sake of his duties. On the other hand most young guys' main aim would be to enjoy life whether its college or work, as they get someone who cares aboutthem.

My first point of view will be that if we have all that knowledge in the brain we can be much more cleverer and we won't have to ask our classmates about the problems that we have. We can solve it ourselves. It will be better to do it yourself than ask others because it will be quite embarrassing. You will have to look at others' faces just to wait for their answer and i'll prefer not to do that. Next will be to get better grades because we have many academic subjects in our heads normatter how many subjects in a day we will be able to know must of the needs in the topic. And then at the end of the year or tears when the grades come out you will be proud of yourself.,"Some more students will come to you and ask you the question that they don't understand so you can be their teacher to teach them what ever thing they need and they will look up on you as My last point will be the teachers, sometimes you can find the teacher struggling with some questions and you can help them by telling them some clues so they will know what to do after all.",1

Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents.

I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies.

Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities.

You can travel alone or with a group, with a guide or without a guide, all of these depend on the motivations of your trip. I think the best way to travel will depend on the motivations of your trip. Maybe if you want to spend so much time quietly relaxing or maybe meditating, you will prefer travelling alone without a guide. The motivations for that kind of trip are only to relax and have a good time. Some people need this time, in this rush society where all the things pass very fast. Some people need space to enjoy themselves and have time to themselves. For these reasons I believe if you decide to have your time the best way to travel is alone. But the other way is if you want to enjoy yourself and take a trip for educational reasons you will choose to go with a group and guide. The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go to.

1578266.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I think young people can enjoy life more than older people. Young people are living in a better living condition than older people. I think my living conditions are much better than my parents'. Now I have better houses to live in which are always with air conditioners and heaters. That makes me feel more comfortable than the houses my parents used to live in. The housing conditions can affect one's health and feelings. I do not have the same health problems as my parents. My mom has very bad backpain because when she was young, she used to sleep in a very cold room without heaters during the long winter time. So now she can not enjoy her life like I do. Also, young people have a better place to go. Now we have many beautiful parks. We can visit there whenever we want and do a lot of interesting things we want. We can take our kids to the park and let them play by themselves , While we can enjoy ourselves by chatting with friends or reading the magazines we like. The older people did not have a chance to do such things.",They had to stay in a restricted area.,1

1395384.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I completely disagree with this statement. Ideas and concepts can be learned easily but the most important thing is to practise them and it's more difficult than learning. In school we learn and sometimes memorize a lot of things. From the age of 7 to almost 21 we just try to listen to our lessons, readbooks,do our homework. During all this learning period students are just passive factors,they just listen.","When they involve actively this period,""learning"" reaches the real target of it.",1

When they involve actively this period,""learning"" reaches the real target of it. If students only learn ideas and concepts and they can't find a chance to apply them to the real world or practise, these ideas only take place in the brain for a while and then they will be forgotten. I learned a lot of theories,ideas but I don't remember anything about them now and I can't use this information in any area of my life. It's more functional for children to learn facts rather than ideas. This makes their life easy in the future and the learning process more efficient in this way. Today our education system's based on these ideas which are mentioned above. Teachers only try to give a framework for ideas and concepts with this method students try to just memorize and they don't have the ability to research,because their task is only to learn limited sources of information. They don't understand the real taste of learning so the learning process is getting unsuccessful. Education also shapes the identity and character of a person. When a child learns from school and teachers that learning is just reading, he-she may be a person who doesn't afford to change or learn anything.","Students have to learn facts,so they know.",1
572315.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It's a very interesting topic to write on. Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price. He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price.","Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets success and another takes a regular film which is a flop,who again takes the risk of talking about another variety film, definitely the successful one.",1
1558621.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations. I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies.",Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation.,1
1114825.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"An increasing number of students realize that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts , Unfortunately, there is a growing opposition among the other students , who maintain that learning facts is the most important factor in their studies. However, in the final analysis, I conclude that the former one does make sense. In the following discussion, I would like to present some points to support my statement. In the first place, the key point for my view is that understanding ideas and concepts, undoubtedly, which allow the students to cultivate their ability to self-study, plays the most important role in their studies. Actually, the final aim of the students' studies at university is to promote their sense of independence. For example, in their beginning studies, they need a teacher to guide them. But in their future studies, they must deal with the problems by themselves. Of course, they need to practise their ability to solve the problem when they understand ideas and concepts in class. In addition, the students can understand ideas and concepts by themselves to check out what they have learnt in the class. It is a benefit for them to build up their self-confidence.","Furthermore, It is the best way to supervise the students.",1
1867710.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Our population is evolving towards individualism more and more each day. What was considered proper and in line with duty is now considered boring and out of date. Children tend to think that spending time helping others, is a waste of possible time to take care of themself. By becoming more selfish we forget to help our community. Young people do not see what is important in spending time with different people, they rely on themselves for everything and think others should do the same. But our society has not changed as fast as they think. The world still needs help. For example I used to live in a small village where every decision was made with our whole community, we would attend meetings and decide on how to resolve each problem with the young and the old. I went back to this town a few years ago and realised that children were not even attending the reunions. This shows how much they care.",But on the other hand young people have less time on their school to help others.,1
56222.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In daily life there are a lot of products and some of these are not so good, but most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are! Yes, I agree with this statement because I think that a person has to touch the product he needs because if we follow only the advertisements he can fall into a not good product. For example, if I have to buy some products the first thing is to watch this product and evaluate it because I want to know whether it is good or not. It is like buying a T-shirt of a famous singer or a not famous singer, all the people prefer the first one because they have the name but when they buy it, they do not look at the material (for example), they buy it because it is made by a famous singer. But if we research more and more in another store I think that we can find a better T-shirt for a low cost. Another example is a dish soap that i call'A', the advertisement says that A can clean everything and your dishes will be white like the best white thing.","Then a person goes to buy it because the advertisement says that A does miracles, and when he washes his dishes, he observes that what the advertisement says is not true! Then, in summary I want to say that it is important to think before we do everything especially when we have to choose some product to buy, because sometimes we can take products that most advertisements make much better than they really are and everytime this is a typical thing to spend a lot of money on a product that is not good.",0

1639412.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Many people in the world think that young people enjoy life more than older people do, some people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do. I argue that older people enjoy life more than young people do, because of the fact that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time. Young people always have problems with their life. they never think time is very fast. they only live without the fear of death. for example i and my friend always have problems. because of our problem many of the time we dont want to do any things. we often speak about our problems. we think of going on holiday to reduce stress. Nevertheless we post pone it to another summer and another summer never comes so we never go anywhere. On the other hand, older people think time is very fast. For example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how she was an older woman. She says that if I fell as a young girl if i had the chance to live life again i would travel all over the world`. she always goes to the cinema to watch movies. she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she hasn't been to before. moreover my grandfather is a very interesting old man. he is a good tennis player. He plays tennis every day. he takes a lot of interesting photos to tell life.","To sum up, like my grandmother and grandfather older people like.",1
1758439.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I guess this has become a common way of popularity for all kinds of products. Commonly the publicity agents are ordered to make the products look better in order to make the client obtain a lot more customers. These publicity agents use a lot of techniques to make the products look better, for example they use specialized software like photoshop to increase the size of the product or make it brighter, or maybe an artificial imitation of the product that does not necessarily have the same texture of look. Eventhough one can observe this situation mostly in food products. Fast Food has become a product that often makes advertisements that make food look a lot better than it really is. For example the big chain of fast food restaurants often show some pictures of each of the products they offer so the person can make his/her choice by observing the picture. When the food is delivered to the customer, he/she notices that the appearance of the real product is not even close to that one shown in the picture, for example, the person can get a smaller hamburger or maybe a different type of bread in a sandwich. More over, fast food, this situation has been increasing in all types of products like tooth paste, detergent or even clothes or shoes. Sometimes when a person sees an advertisement for commercialising shoes, they commonly look softer and more comfortable than they really are, when the person gets into the shop and fits them often notice that the shoes were not as good as they look on television.",This certainly is a problem that is sourrounding us and overall is making people lose a lot of time.,1

1251412.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"In my opinion and in my own experience, I have travelled with my parents since I was a child, and normally we book the hotel and the rest of the trip is invented, I mean we decide where to go and how much time we spend in each place, We do not have to depend on any guide. If you want to travel in Europe for example and you have only one month, sometimes it is better to have a guide becausehe knows the best places that you can visit, but the problem is that he is going to tell you when you have to eat, when you have to rest and even worse when you have to wake up. When I went to work in Bangladesh, I did an internship there, anyway, When I finished my job, I started to travel in Myanmar and then in the North of India, I bought a guide book, called Lonely planet, with that book I knew which places I could visit, where you can eat, sleep and even better how much money you have to pay. I liked to travel by myself because you can learn more about the culture of each place and sometimes you can take part in it. When I arrived in Bangladesh I never thought that I was going to find a girlfriend there, I did not try to meet a married girl , I met a girl from Switzerland and actually she is my girlfriend, this kind of experience I think is more difficult to have if you travel in a group. For example in Myanmar I met a local person and when I saw him again, He invited me tohis wedding, These aspects are the best of the trip because you never think that it is going to happen. Another good thing if you travel by yourself is that you are going to meet new friends and you can join them on their trip. I do not say that in a group you are not going to meet people, of course you will. My advice is: if you are young and you can travel like a backpacker, do it, because when you are old and you can not walk long distances, I think it is better to pay a tour guide, because you do not have to worry about anything only you have to wake up early.",You will remember more if you face some problems during your trip because you have to handle them.,0

Young people nowadays seem to be more interested and involved in their own life and problems than the community as a whole. The present day world has undergone a more dramatic change than it used to be, say a generation ago. It has become much more competitive and demanding. The advent of globalisation has led to drastic repercussions. In today's world only the best can survive. Recently an article was there in the newspaper about globalisation. It was stated there that globalisation is producing rich countries with poor people not only in developing countries but also in developed countries like the United States. The fruits of globalisation are mainly distributed among the rich and the highly skilled people. Unskilled and less skilled labor are no longer the recipients of these fruits. This puts an immense pressure on young people to achieve great skill in whatever art they are pursuing. They could not devote enough time to other causes, like any work related to the upliftment of their communities. For them their own survival is the key issue.",They want to be a part of the ongoing globalisation.,1

Also young people lack the sense of responsibility which prevents them from helping their communities. They think that just by being a part of a community and following its rules and regulations is sufficient. They have forgotten the fact that with rights comes duties.","So, I would once again like to support the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities.",1
