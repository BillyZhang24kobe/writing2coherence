Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts.

1630850.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years from now, surely. Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem.

Before starting a hard job I know I can deal with that job as long as I want. If I face difficulties, I can spare bigger time for my job.

To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is because he does not know about the realities. If he had already learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into a puzzle. In addition, students always get more interest in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts. Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt to society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already knew the facts. Besides, students can also use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas.","In summary, it is obvious that ideas and concepts are much more important for students to learn than just understanding for the reason of the clearness of the reality, student's interests in the subject and the benefits for their future.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"In summary, it is obvious that learning facts is much more important for students than just understanding ideas and concepts for the reasons of the clearness of reality, students' interests in the subject, and the benefits for their future."

1829333.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I do not agree with the statement that in twenty years fewer cars will be in use than there are today, because of the importance of cars as a means of transportation. In a globalized world cars have a very big influence on our whole life. They are an important means of transportation in trade as well as a means of a flexible lifestyle. Without cars the exchange of goods in a globalized world would be much more complicated. Also the exchange of people, in the sense of employees and workers, would be much more difficult. Many people depend on their car to get to work. For example people who are working in Frankfurt or other big cities are often forced to drive many hours to their place of work, because they can not afford apartments in the cities to livein. Without a car they would be forced to move houses or to find work next to their home, which is in many cases because of the high unemployment. Without a car people would not be flexible any longer. They would be forced to take the bus or the train, which are often overcrowded, late and in the case of the train in Germany very expansive. The limitation of cars would have a deep impact on the whole society. If there were fewer cars it would be necessary to replace them with other sources of transportation, like trains or busses.",Today many cities lack the financial capacity to finance such a big project.,1,,,,,,,,

12040.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"This is a hard question, because success means not the same thing for all people, and also because both ways can take you to success. In my case, I am a tennis player. For me success would be to become a professional player. To achieve this there are no secret formulas, there are no new things to try, nothing like that, but doing what must be done, and what has been done since the early years of this sport, working for it. Also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind ""if it is working and giving you results do not change or try something new"", successful tennis players do not take great risks, nor try new things, they just do what they know they do best, and stick to it if it is working. So this makes me think things should work like this in every other subject, if something is giving you success, why change it? Maybe if you are just in search of that ""success"" in other subjects rather than sports you should try new things, for example in pizzas, we have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Peter Piper Pizza, etc.","so maybe thinking in subjects like this is hard to achieve success following the same steps others did long ago, because of all the competition, maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so competitive subject, so maybe here it is when you will have to try new things, explore new markets etc.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"So maybe thinking in subjects like this, it is hard to achieve success following the same steps others did long ago.

1881808.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First, I think they can succeed because they have already taken their risk, it is all risk out side the world, each thing has a risk but seems to big or small. For example, if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be an accident on you. Taking risks is a must. The mean of success is they know how to do things well, A human being has a tendency to learn more to find out new things. Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve. Successful people know that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up with them.","They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what the world needs so they can do it.",1,,,,,,,,
1569573.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination. of course every idea can be based onfacts. but sometimes it's wrong because students have to try to think of things someyears ago. many schools force students to study with formulas and memorize only facts. they didn't allow students to speak their opinions freely. but these days, many systems have changed in school. they encourage students' creative activity. when childhood is important to students they don't know much about society and the future and around many things. Free thinking can be helpful in our society. these thinking can produce a more advanced future. just to learn the facts and memorize them block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can. for example , i read the book a few days ago after reading the book i agreed with it. the book includes information about French education. the children learn mathematics in school they have to solve the problem but they can't count the number well. when they learned mathematics they were focussed on remembering the formula and they always studied the same questions. sometimes they faced higher problems but they also depended on the formula. so, oneday their homeroom teacher asked them ""which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2? ""children answered ""1/4"" they knew only a bigger number. they couldn't think about the amount and range and degree.","so i suggest that they should be learnd with new ways like experiments and express their thinking,even if it's wrong.",1,,,,,,,,

It would even be harder for him to memorize the facts. But on the other hand, if he understands the ideas and the concepts, he will be able to get to the facts on his own, without having to memorise them, perfectly knowing what is going on. Understanding these concepts and ideas, the student works his brain and can even think of something new and way better. This is how the world grows and expands and the evolution goes. The student will also learn how to work on his own, express himself, his opinions and contribute to the development of a stronger and powerful society. If they just learn the facts, it means that only one or a few people will know the reasons, giving him or them the entire power over the others, the ability to make decisions as he wants, even if they are wrong or should not be done. I strongly agree with those who think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts.","We will build a more effective world that way, and promote world solidarity.",1,,,,,,,,

First, as technology improves, too many recreations could deflect the concentration of young kids. For instance, video games and the internet, created in the late 1980's, provide much more visual pleasure than before. So more and more young people would like to spend all their time playing games or chatting on the net rather than giving some time to help their communities.

In the present era most young people have become self centred and they are not in a mood to know about the problems of the world. they are always seeking their own comforts. for example consider that if robbers have entered the neighbour's house of a man and he comes to know that, first he is taking care of the valuables in his house rather than helping his neighbour. nowadays, young people are lacking in moral and ethical values. they have become worse than the birds. i. e. if a crow dies or is wounded then a large number of crows gather at that place and shout,but when it comes to people if a person is met with an accident on a road most of them pass as if they dont see that incident. They did not even call an ambulance. instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness. According to me this system has to change,each human should help others. One person has to help atleast three people in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person has to ask those three individually to help three others.",now nine people have been benefited and these nine have to help three others each individually.,1,,,,,,,,

1939513.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"For as long as college exists in society,the professors and students have debated whether having a lot of academic knowledge would be better or having specialized ones. The issue may not be resolved to everybody's satisfaction the answer is crystal-clear in my mind. Taking many academic subjects will be the best for your education. That many academic subjects are better for education is evident for several reasons. First, when you are educated in school or some institute,in most cases the students' goals in the future are vague. In this kind of situation the students will need a variety of information which will lead to their future being very attractive. To illustrate,my sister who is in college, has not decided on her job after school. However she is now taking many academic classes to broaden her knowledge and also make herself a well-balanced character which will lead to her future goals. Second,by taking many academic subjects you will get to know a variety of friends whose background and thoughts are different. For example,the college I had graduate offers many academic subjects in the freshman year. After ten years have passed,the friends I made at that time are still very good friends and influenced me. Nevertheless,some critics may contend that specific subjects will be more effective to educate workers for specific jobs such as lawyer, engineer, physician among others. However,recent graduate school graduates more well-balanced students from other areas. My brother who had been working as a sales rep for a computer finally could get in to graduate school for a doctorate.",They require applicants who have taken many academic subjects from under graduate schools and can talk and listen with their patients very carefully.,1,,,,,,,,

For example a student preparing for his exams is coming over in a few days, to get rid of that he must read properly so that he does not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need to mug up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam.

In today's fast life ,as no one has time even for breakfast,and time for more competition and hurry has come for everyone. I think there will be more need for cars in the coming twenty years,because life will become more advanced than today. First ,People use cars for going to different places such as schools,colleges,work places or any other place such as going for a trip with family or friends. Going on a trip with family or friends is not possible without a car,we will not enjoy it if we do not go by car. If we go by train or any other way ,I think we will not enjoy our trip more. This proves that the use of cars can not be stopped,and it will become more and more in the coming years. And one important thing is that people are going towards a luxurious life more in coming years.","Second , as competition is growing more and more between people of the same or different organizations,they need to manage their time fast and effectively so, they use cars and use of cars can not be stopped in the coming years.",1,,,,,,,,

The money, and the obsession with money get that the companies and the advertising people do not take care about the quality of the products. It is like ""if that did not work, it is better for us. Now you are obligated to buy our product again. ""The second reason why most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is the people's ignorance.

He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank.",The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time.,1,,,,,,,,

1053764.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays young people don't spend their time helping their communities. In my opinion young people should be more involved in their communities. Young people should deal with the problems of their communities. Nevertheless, young people have to deal with many problems related to their life. As a consequence, they don't have time to help their communities. On the one hand, I believe that young people should try to eliminate the negative aspects of their society. On the other hand, I think that the communities must understand the young people's problems and try to solve them. Young people have a lot of problems during their life. In particular, they have social problems. For example, they have difficulties having relationships and they are not able to relate with society. As a result they prefer to stay alone. Furthermore, in many cases young people during their studies must find absolutely a job. Young people after work want to spend their time with their friends or family.",Moreover sometimes young people disagree with the decisions taken by their communities.,1,,,,,,,,

1806306.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are three reasons in my opinion which led to the situation. First, there are too many amusing activities to do. New high-tech toys and recreations are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stuck on those things. Big companies use strong advertising and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spend time on the products. Moreover, interacting with friends takes most young people's time. All of these activities occupied every minute of them. Second, education from young people's parents does not give them the idea.

People these days seem to pay a lot of attention to ideas, but the fact is, this has made a lot of useless 'inventions'. Because  of this, I saw a new 'invention' the other day. It was a little fan that could be tied on the arm, which could be used for cooling off the hot noodles while people were picking up the noodles. The fan is not tiny, but even if it is, is there really a lot of consumers for this kind of product? I do not think so. If i were the customer, i wouldn't even bring a fan to a restaurant just to cool off the noodles.",This is one example of people only getting the idea but not the fact.,1,,,,,,,,

819260.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"We can see many successful people in the word such as BILL GHATES and EINSTINE. BILL GHATES made a lot of money from creating a software called windows and EINSTINE made a great theory such as E=mc2. Even the way they succeed is different the common thing is that they gave their entire life to buildingit. In my opinion successful people don't try new things but try to develop the things they can do well. BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old. At that time there were two famous companies called MACANTOSHI & APPLE(well later they united though). He tried to learn computers because it was very interesting. later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself. This kind of result was possible because he constantly developed his talent. In my opinion, successful finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important. EINSTINE is also a successful person is a physicist. His new theory about black energy, black holes, time, lights and movement destroyed newton and platon's theory and made a new page in the history of physics. It is hard to believe that this huge theory was made by a single man. In my opinion, the reason it was possible is because he always thought about physics. Many books and researchers say that he thought about physics 60 percent of the time. As you can see successful people develop their talents rather than finding a new way. To conclude I think that successful people find their talent and develop what they already know how to do rather than finding a new thing to do.",It is because no pains no gains.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"This is because, as the saying goes, ""no pains, no gains."""

In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part. You should know everything about this part. I want to give an example.

1408795.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The world changes very fast. People change with the world and they have to adapt to society in the best way. Young people nowadays have different tasks to do from the people who were young in the past. Today life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different to those 20 years ago. A young person has to go to college or university, maybe he has to work if he wants to pay for his studies or other activities. The free time is not a lot, so when a student is free, he usually goes out with his friends and to think about enjoying activities like going to a disco or listening to music. Someone might think that it is selfish but I am sure that a young person must have a leisuretime. However the time can be spent for the communities. It's quite true that a lot of young people don't like helping their communities. The young people nowadays are not all lazy. I can explain this point by a clear example. Last week I went to a rock party which was organized by one of my best friends. He worked a lot because this event was wonderful, but he did it with other guys. The party was a music competition. There were a lot of people and everyone was very happy because the players were fantastic and the organization was too. In conclusion I think that today young people are different from the young people in the past so a comparison is not so easy. The free time is less and the things to do are more.",The young people's mistake is to think that doing something for the communities is boring.,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"However, the young people's mistake is to think that doing something for the communities is boring."
1329241.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family.","I would like to give an example of my father who is a manager in a company, When i was a toddler he taught me to take first firm few steps in the path of my life and gave me good quality education by enrolling me in a good public school where i could set fort my academicjourney, so he has the responsibility to give me a good career in the path of my life by giving much attention to me he rather by enjoying himself he gave me platform to secure me future to path of success.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, my father, who is a manager in a company, taught me to take my first steps in life and provided me with a good education by enrolling me in a good public school.

Consequently, we can wonder whether the products we see on television are really good or not. I totally disagree with advertisements because they turn people into stupid.

For example, there are a lot of advertisements for food whereas everybody knows that these products are very bad for one's health.

1594875.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that products seem much better than they really are in most advertisements.

In addition, a lot of technologies are available to do so. Finally the government is not playing a role in restricting the way of advertisingeffectively.

They most of the time conduct some studies to gauge the public's favourite in order to reflect the results in the advertisement.

One example is that most of them use some kind of effecting function when they take the photo or the film of their product for the advertisement in order to appeal to the people efficiently and effectively. In some extreme cases, completely created computer graphic images are used as a photo of the product. Sometimes companies do too much to make their products look better, and people will doubt about the product in their hands is really the same thing they saw in the advertisement.","In this kind of case, the consumer is sort of deceived by the company.",1,,,,,,,,

I think that is a good way to get more information and make the travelers not miss the best places that people should visit. I think that it is more effective and helpful because, having a tour guide and he or she is usually from the place that the traveler is heading too. The tour guide will provide a lot of information and advice to the traveler much then asking a friend. For example he or she will have the best to teach or inflounce the traveler. In addition, some times the tour guide will teach the traveler the country's culture and language or slang that the travel agency can not do. That will make them have more information known and information about the people who live in this country. Also, it will make it easy for the traveler to ask them about the culture. Because usually travelers have a lot of questions that they need to know now about the culture that they are going to and it is not easy for them to ask someone who lives there.

For example, in my personal experience, I have been on a trip without any plans with my friends.","One day, one of my friends suddenly suggested going on a trip and we just agreed to go on a trip that day, because we were young and impulsive.",1,,,,,,,,
1505558.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"These days, so many people hold the opinion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experience, life style and emotional environment. However some peoplen'tdon't. They hold the opinion that successful people would try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages. From my personal perspective, i would prefer the second opinion. first of all, doing what they already know how to do well is safer to get success, however, it may also make you lose something that may even more important. Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you only do what you already know at your times, you may fall behind the times. So its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages. the most valuable benefit of my opinion is that trying new things and taking risks may lead you to get more experience in the changing world, you may never lose any information. And that is what the first opinion would never achieve.",What's more the advantages of my opinion are bigger than its disadvantages.,1,,,,,,,,

I agree with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. If you travel in a group and you have a tour guide you get to know the most famous places and you get to know interesting things about the country you decided to visit. The tour guide would organise everything for you, so the only thing you would have to do is to go to the appointments with the group. Another aspect is that you would get to know a lot of interesting people. When you travel in a group it is very easy to get to know other people because usually you sit on the same bus or you sleep in the same hotel like the others do. That is why you are never bored when you travel in groups. If you decide to travel in a group and you visit a country which is dangerous then the tour guide can inform you about these dangers and he can tell you how to avoid risks. Sometimes there are special rules or other things which can bring you in trouble when you do not follow them. Furthermore a tour guide can help you with communication problems.","When you are not able to speak the language the people in the country you visit speak, then the tour guide can help you because he has to be able to speak it.",1,,,,,,,,

For example, a game center is the place where we can play many games. Many young people go there and enjoy games. However it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people. Also, I think that young people have a chance to communicate with people more. Young people go to schools and meet friends. They can also join many activities outside of school. Older people may join in with some activities but there are not many activities for older people. In my experience, I went to the USA last year as an exchange student and I met alot of people who I could not see if I was in Japan.

Younger people would say I am old enough to go out of the family and experience the world. In the year 2006, many things happened to me.

Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been.

If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them.

439202.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"This is a controversial issue to define the important factor for students. Someone's priority knowledge of ideas and concepts that students gain is the most important factor in education However, others may say that experiences from facts are an important factor for students. These priorities would depend on everyone's previous life experience. In my case, I grew up in a school that gave me a mixed educational method,and that the method was equally balanced. Since I recognise mixed educational policy, both factors are key to obtaining better concepts, and at least I can say both factors were needed and just one of those would not bring a significant result. When I was an elementary school student, I learned the concept of insects. That was the first time that someone told me a concept. I was engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insects. This easy introduction of concept brought me a significant amount of knowledge even though I spent my time and funds to have more knowledge of insects.

For example students learning the subjects like Physics ,mathematics , there is a need to understand the ideas and concepts related to the problem or topic. by knowing the concepts and ideas he can these ideas any where in that field. The second reason is that if they practice the same procedure i. e understanding the ideas and concepts related to the topic they may create a history in that field.

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy, it is true. But let me tell you this; Albert Einstein has a quote: ""Knowledge is power. ""which is completely true. Think of Biology without Chemistry; Chemistry without Physics; Physics without Geometry: Geometry without Maths and so on. A chemist cannot explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without Physics, can he? Or a Physics master cannot measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lights it, can he? Another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago. Take Pascal as an example. He has a lot of proven theories in Maths  and Physics. Isn't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored in and made himself known in? The answers to these questions I pointed out are simple and true: The laws of nature, the languages spoken, people and all the others that we know of are in only one place: here on earth. No one can prove that the facts about it aren't linked to one another. The links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end, you will end up finding yourself at the other.

662487.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Well I'm not sure about this. I think I agree because it looks obvious that nowadays, young people normally think more about themselves , and do not really care about their communities, at least most of them. They think it's more interesting to do something that will give them a benefit at the moment, or soon, and for sure, than spending time on something that will give a small benefit to other people, and just maybe. But I also think that this is changing. Each day I can see more young people who care more about their community, and help, probably because their parents have a different mind than the parents of the young people before, and teach them in a different way that they have to help.","Everyday I can see, for example, that they recycle, they dont throw trash on the floor, they care about politics and discuss them, etc.",1,,,,,,,,

In my opinion cars are the most important transportation vehicles in our society. In modern business flexibility is one of the most important things. Only the car allows everybody to carry distances at every time he wants to every place he needs. Public transportation systems have a lot of advantages especially in big cities with only little space. In these cities most of the people travel everyday on the same route. But for longer distances public transportation systems are not flexibleenough. Another argument for my opinion is that having a car makes life easier. For example a car is very useful if you go to the supermarket buying a lot of boxes of water or beer.,It is impossible to carry these things by bike or by bus.,1,,,,,,,,

In my opinion people won't ever give up these advantages unless they can not afford a car anymore. For example I need my car nearly every day because my parents live in a small city which has hardly any public transportation system. There are only a few buses and they do not reach most of the places. I think public transportation systems are too expensive for small areas or cities.

Admittedly, with the complete development of the public transportation system such as the development of underground transportation, the system will obtain larger capacity , which would be a replacement to the use of cars. However, according to a statistical survey, there is also an increase in the population. On the other hand, the development of the Internet will reshape the way people communicate with each other, which means that people will not have to communicate with each other through public transportation, however, it does not mean that people will replace the traditional way of communicating.

15340.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students can learn about many things in school. When students learn new things, It is very important for students to know what they are learning from classes. And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts. I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from text books.

1980133.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I believe that every stage of life has its purpose. As the saying goes, 'there's a time for everything'. A time to enjoy being young and a time to enjoy being old. Surely, I can relate to the feeling of missing the younger years. Those times seemed to have been better than now. When we are young we are usually happier, but, sadly, that is caused by ignorance and a lack of responsibility. For example, people who are around 20 years old could seem to be happier than people over 30, but that doesn't mean that there are no complications in the younger way of life. When people are over 30 they are very likely to have been through the challenges in life that define a person and make him or her to be called an adult. Also, It could be very stressful to be an adolescent or even a kid, with all of those things that you need to survive to be able to call yourself a grown man or a woman. Older people seem to be less fun I suppose. But that is not the rule. There's no need for us to expect that every grown up is boring and not funny. I believe that if people can find a way not to lose that spark they had when they were younger it could be a fun way of living for sure. I can see that life could become more and more enjoyable as we grow up, and I bet that it is going to stay that way as my yet young life spans into the future.","Furthermore, I can recall being a kid and wishing to be smarter and more mature, I wanted to be able to understand life and the way things are in the world.",1,,,,,,,,

All over the world , they try to create new and innovative things. then we cannot stop their needs for making good and new things such as robots, machines and cars. some scientists try to spread out the car which makes no pollution or uses natural resources.

1611251.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is more important for a student to understand concepts and ideas than to learn facts by hearing. This is for some simple reasons. It might be better for a student to learn facts, dates and results because that is what the teacher asks for. But in real life, this means life after school, the time you need to work for your money to survive, it is better to understand things.

In school I had two different teachers in physics  in 2 years. The first one was not really motivated and asked us to work with the book and in exams we had to summarise what we had read. My second teacher was round about the same age, but totally different. 1. he loved to teach and his methods were very different. He did experiments and so on. The first teacher gave me 5 points(max15) the second one is still my teacher and made me choose physics as the subject I like to study, just by motivating me. The result was 15 points in the final exam.",These two points show and my small story show why I think that it is really important to make students understand what they learn.,1,,,,,,,,

1119781.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people tend to do things which are not familiar with them and take risks. I have several reasons for this. First, challenging new things makes people well-rounded. To take a personal example, when I was a junior high school student, I hated studying liberal subjects, history,art, music. I had never been to museums or concert halls. However, when I was a university student, I changed my mind and tried to study liberal subjects. Thanks to the change, I became a well-rounded person who can talk to any person. As the above example illustrates, trying new things makes people well-rounded. Second, people can find their best ways when they try new things. For instance, four years ago, I applied for a new project in my company which I did not know how to do well.

They have clubs , pubs and various other hangouts to keep themselves alive all the time. Young people are free from various fears and responsibilities that come with age.

1863980.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The issue of the reliability of advertising is controversial due to the impact it has on consumers and authorities. On the one hand, companies need to advertise their products and create awareness in their target audience's mind. But on the other hand, the actual market is constantly under pressure ,as well as its workers who have obligations regarding the company they belong to. However ,sometimes we could argue that enhancing the reality of a product in order to achieve good results and sell more of it remains strongly unethical. The first reason why advertisers should not make the product they are selling seem much better than it really is, is simply because they will not attract consumers in the long run. Indeed consumers might try the product once but if their expectations are not fully satisfied according to what they saw in the advertising, they will not repeat the buying process.","In the same way, by doing so ,consumers will lose faith in the brand which is advertising.",1,,,,,,,,

However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject.

1456863.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Although some people may think that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are, I totally agree that it helps the product to be sold out in the market with the result of the consumers' curiosity, if it is an advertisement made of/for women and if the advertisement is colourful enough. First of all, advertisements increase the curiosity of people especially if it is for women. Assume that a woman is watching the TV, who loves chocolate and sees the commercial on the television which has the mother seeing her son and her husband as a bar of chocolate and wanting to get a bite of them, the woman watching the commercial will be curious about the product and will give it a try. It is obvious that she won't be the only one so this will give a chance for that product to take place on the market shelf. It will be the consumers' decision to keep it there or ignore it on the next visit. The second thing is that women are the best customers in the world. It may not be the man who would like to give it a try if he sees the product right after he sees the advertisement but a woman can keep it in mind in the shopping list and that list appears when it comes to shopping and she picks up the product and gives it a try. For example, if it is a man who is in the market to get a pack of coffee he most likely picks up the package of coffee he is used to but if it is a woman she gets her regular coffee with the one she saw on the board on her way to the mall. The third one is colourful and well prepared advertisements. A car you would never ask for may look like a Ferrari to you in a well prepared commercial and you may go ahead and see it in the store. The minute you step into the store the staff in there takes control and does anything for you to be interested in that car.","Finally,I believe that the right way of advertising the product will take it's place in the market.",1,,,,,,,,

The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are.","Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it.",0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Third, however, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it."

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well. That means that it is so competitive in that area. If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others, it is rare to achieve success. Let's think about one example.

This statement may become true or false, because it is a guess but why did people believe in that guess or not. First of all I strongly believed in that statement. As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to travel by bus, subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because of improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have the chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway.",That is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling.,1,,,,,,,,

And if they fail in a project, they can totally change their activity because they are more adaptable. So experimenting with new things is very useful to have success because the world is changing every day and it will not adapt to you, you will adapt to it. Imagine a grocery which only sells apples.

The second reason is that, the tour guide will choose a good place for me better than I do. One time when I went to a new city I asked for a good place to go and how I could go there.

Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble.

Besides it differs from young and old people. In this essay, I am going to show that young people enjoy life more than old people because of health and age differences. Young people enjoy life more than older people, since young people are more healthy than old ones. As a matter of fact, young people are vivid ;that is to say ,they are full of life ;they, indeed ,can travel long distances enjoying the beauty of the land scape without any complaint. Nevertheless, old people cannot travel such distances and they easily get tired. In addition, young people can do other activities,such as going to the disco,swimming or hiking. Olders ,on the contrary, prefer sleeping or taking a nap rather than amusing themselves. Old people do not enjoy their life like young people because of age. Some old people think that during their youth they enjoyed their time and believe that the remaining of their life should be devoted to their children.

To begin with, our society ,recently, should get human resources to get specialized knowledge in many areas such as technology, economy and policy.

354664.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I completely agree with the statement that ' successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very well known , it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction than everybody else does. Take for example the case of  the'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called the successful person even though he is not present, just because he did something different and tried a new thing that is the reason Reliance is so popular today. The new care taker of the Reliance company is the son of its founder, so we cannot call them equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his business. What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the business with not much money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established business. Taking risks is another part of success as it is a well saying ' more the risk involved, more the chances of success'.","As one can also see, a good thing always involves a high amount of risk.",1,,,,,,,,

Young people are considered the seeds of hopes in a country. Helping the communities not only accumulate young people's personal experiences but expand their visions of the various and nourishing lives. I argue that young people ought to pay more attention to the communities and be willing to spend time helping the communities. Therefore, I fully agree that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping their communities. Here are some reasons why. First of all, due to the flourishing media activities, the grand and big cities are undoubtedly fascinated by young people. They are eager to leave their home towns and build up their own dreams and realize those dreams in prosperous cities. For example, in some developed countries such as Taiwan and Japan , young people enthusiastically move to those grand cities to pursue their future. Only the elderly and the children stay in their communities. Furthermore, the government does not put in practice the education of how and why people should help their communities.

1741422.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops. Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body.","They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"As a result, children just want to do, have, eat, or drink everything they are told is good, brand new, and cool."
1049329.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand ideas more than facts. With the development of technology, more and more people pay their attention to learning knowledge. But which is the correct and effective way to learn knowledge? Some people may think that learning the facts is much better than learning from books, but actually they are totally wrong. Since if you want to understand a thing, the only way is to understand the concepts and ideas. First of all, learning ideas is a system and logical study. It is going to help people learn a thing very logically and efficiently. For example, when you face a big problem, the first thing you should do is to find out what is wrong with it and then get to know how to solve it. These processes are all based on the understanding of ideas. To imagine that you do not even know what the idea is, how can you solve it? Obviously, ideas are more important than faces. Secondly, ideas and concepts can help students to see the deep part of a thing. When you know the facts, you may think it is right or wrong from your point of view, but actually that's may not be true. At this time, you need to know the ideas, the idea can help you to understand the thing, and make you really understand what that means or how things work, that's really very important. A really understanding does not mean you know the facts, actually it means the concepts. Thirdly, learning the idea is very essential and useful. Actually the idea is the main part of learning a thing, only if you understand what the idea of it is, can you study it.","For instance, when I read a book, first of all I need to know the concept of it and then I will read it and know the entire book spontaneously.",1,,,,,,,,

Second, concerning cost effectiveness, we should spend much more money on the tour which is followed by a tour guide. Third, I would like to travel with my family and my best friends.

1299928.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statement that says ""successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. ""The reason why I agree with this statement is this. If successful people only do whatever they know very well, we will have around the world the same things. For example, cars, if people are eager to buy new models of cars, and they do not try to do something new, how boring, we do not have a lot of options, but because they take risks we have numerous options when we are looking for a car, you, me, everybody can buy all kinds such as: a BMW, a Jaguard, a Camry, a Jeep, etc. Also, people who want to start a new restaurant, the want to open something new. If in the area where they are going to build this new restaurant there are some Chinese, Greek, or Thai food, but they do not have real Mexican food, I think that the best thing they can do is start a restaurant that is not in this area. Another example is Fashion, women love fashion, they do not wear the same clothes, they change almost 365 days during the years. The new customers are fighting each other in order to have the best design, they are risking, but if the design is the best, they will get a good income. If you do not risk it, I am almost sure, you won't win. Take a risk and you will be successful in life. In life we need to risk most of the time.","You take risks when you want to change to another job because you can get a better salary, but who knows that you will be there for a long time, or when you move to another city, it is risky but do not be afraid, you will be fine, the only thing you need is trust in yourself.",1,,,,,,,,

But many of the people that attend university are not young, and for them i think that the lessons have to be more interactive and with facts.

With a group led by a tour guide,you can go wherever you want with a group of people;furthermore, some of them can become your friendslater on. Travel in a group led by a tour guide gives you a global and detailed approach to your travel, you usually get more friends with a group than travel by yourself. For example a couple of years ago, i went to Marroco by myself to visit the country,if it was not the tour guide that i did, i think that, i would spend the entire amount of my money without visiting the main places of the country. The tour guide was really helpful and unforgettable.",The easiest way to go travelling in another place is to travel with a group led by a tour guide.,1,,,,,,,,

1054917.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject. Before applying students should take the following aspects into consideration. Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you have received the job you can still and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for. Secondly, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extent there is some truth in it, but, undoubtedly, experience shows that no matter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same.","Nevertheless, doing a generalistical degree is in my opinion, better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time.",1,,,,,,,,

Unless the student gets the idea of what the subject is and what the concept behind writing all these tasks in a subject it is used less for the student to do a course. A student who goes along with the idea and the concept of the subject gains a lot of grip on the subject and he may produce any thing regarding the subject on demand. For example,let us take a student who is having a subject in C language on his/her course,the student who first goes through the text book and gets the idea of the language and what the subject is and what is needed for programming in a C language can write a technical program for a small application based on C language. On the other hand the student who goes through the facts of the subject will not get the practical idea and he cant produce an application in C language. How can he produce an application with out knowing what is the main idea of the subject and what is the concept that outputs an application in C language. Even the student who is having a course in Maths in his academic year,if he goes along with the facts that are related to the subject how can he solve a problem related to the subject of mathematics. On the other hand the students who get the complete idea ragrading the idea and the concept of the subject can automatically solve the problem given. The first task is that the student should know what the idea is and after that he can go through the facts of the book and he also requires learning knowledge regarding the subject. Finally,i conclude that the student should go for the preparation of a subject in a manner of getting the idea regarding the subject and the concept regarding the subject. Unless these two things the student ca not approach the practical way of the subject. Its quite difficult to get a grip on the subject with out the concept and idea of the subject.",In the same way after getting the complete idea and conceptragarding the subject the student may further go for the facts read from the text books or materials.,1,,,,,,,,

1446679.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life.

Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups. They make some funny statements, and sometimes jokes. Sometimes, the information is real but it is conveyed in a group such a way that everybody laughs. For example, I went to visit a museum, i. e Tajmahal in India. This tajmahal is built by the Sahjaha in love of the wife.

Second, older people have a great deal of knowledge and experience to spend time on. For example, older people can enjoy it even in five minutes, if they know how to write a poem.

I think it is good for a person to have a background in many subjects. However, he must concentrate on one subject which will be his major in college and the field of his job. Each person should have one specialized subject. A doctor cannot be a civil engineer at the same time. There are many reasons why I think specialization in knowledge is better. First, every society must consist of people that have knowledge about different subjects. As the human body contains different members that work independently and consistently, society needs individuals with different jobs and ways of thinking. In addition, people are different in what they are interested in and we cannot find a person who is interested in all academic subjects. For example, I like computer engineering but hate medicine whereas my brother's interests are just the opposite of mine. Besides, the human brain is limited and a person cannot be creative in many fields. This century is not like the past when one scientist, like Newton, was shining in physics and mathematics.","As we have noticed, societies must consist of people of different knowledge and it is impossible to find a person who is creative in many academic fields.",1,,,,,,,,

1658336.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Many people will have different ways of responding to this question. but most would say yes it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts. Understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life, once students understand concepts and ideas facts will come to them and, students will know what they are talking about later on. First of all, understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will naturally come to them. for example, in business, if the students boss tells them to go do this this and this the student will immediately understand the idea and once he has understood the idea he will naturally understand the concept in order to do something. Second, once the student understands the idea and concept behind something the facts will automatically come to him. for instance, once the student understands an idea he understands a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand facts because because all facts have an idea and a concept behind them. moreover, it would be hard for the student just to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life has concepts and ideas even facts. Finally, the student will know what he/she is talking about later on. say for example a student is trying to impress someone and she only knows facts she will say all the facts but will not understand what she is saying or even what isgoing on. however, beforehand if this student were to know here concepts and ideas she could easily know what she/he is talking about later on when she gives a speech or wants to impress someone. In conclusion, students will know what they are talking about, once the students know concepst and ideas facts will just come to them and, understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors to them later on in life.",So all in all understanding concepts and ideas has many more advantages than just knowingfacts.,1,,,,,,,,

The advertisement is made generally to achieve the customer attention because in this way there is more possibility that the customer will buy the product. There are some people that study for a lot of years to learn the rules of marketing and to learn the right ways to achieve their customers. Today, on television, we can see a lot of beautiful advertisements. We are often interested and enjoied by them, but when we buy these products in a supermarket, we are often not so happy with our purchase. I think that often the advertisements that I see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention. For example next week I saw the advertisement forBarilla, a famous firm that produces some types of pasta, and I thought that this was a little film. It`s beautiful because it talks about life, the ways that children have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her baby, through all of this the advertisement also speaks also of a new type of pasta called ""piccolini"". I think that this is a beautiful advertisement and each time that I watch it on tv I really want to buy the product.","A few days after I had seen this advertisement I had eaten this type of pasta and I understood that it was not so good as I believed, infact I prefer the normal type of Barilla pasta so much.",1,,,,,,,,

I do agree that young people do help, but the point is they did not give enough time to helping. Maybe they just spent a few minutes donating some money or giving their seats to the elderly on the train or bus. That is totally not sufficient. Regarding those issues, there are a few reasons that cause this issue. First of all, young people are too busy.

Helping may mean helping in the family (which is part of the community) or by helping direct the community. There are several methods of helping in communities.

In a general way, it is somebody who realizes something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way. Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful? Is it necessary to show all those virtues to be successful? Is it the only condition to be successful? On the one hand, successful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful. So, it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful. On the other hand, somebody may have a lot of virtues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized. It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like BASE jumping, but without being outstanding and recognized, this person is not yet successful, only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful. The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those virtues. First, a successful person can show only one of those virtues and be successful. Somebody creating a new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks. And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member, and then becoming famous and successful. Finally without any of those virtues , somebody can handle everything from another and get indirectly successful. We have seen that success is not related to the virtues enounced in the statement. Then, I would say that anybody can be successful However, it is not linked to any willpower of the person but it is due to other factors dependent on theenvironment.","In spite of the possible random of success, the person must act in a certain manner to attract success knowing that it could be in vain.",1,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it is recommended to study concepts because the process of understanding a concept stimulates and develops thinking skills. For instance, when a student concentrates on the concept of accounting rather than on memorising the balance sheet, he or she will be able to understand much more, like the idea of input and output, in general. Due to this fact , i think that studying concepts is superior to learning facts by heart. Finally, i believe that concepts are easier to memorize than particular facts. Because concepts can be associated with so many situations and with so many mental images, they remain in our mind a very long time. Moreover, concepts tend to become part of our mind, of our permanent way of thinking, but facts don't.","For example, if we understand the concept of trade, there are so many situations we can link this to, like ancient silk trade, slave trade, modern trade , and so on.",1,,,,,,,,

I think there are a lot of young people that help his community and spend a lot of their time on it. For example there are some volunteers in many places: in hospitals, in centers for old people. and so on. I know some people who work for the ambulance: they are volunteers who stay, some times also all night, at the ambulance to give their help in case of need, and the day after they are in office to work. There are also some girls I know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they seek or need help. These girls have a big sense of responsibility for helping others, I think. Moreover, my cousin is always around the community of her church (she is very religious) to give her help to guide and educate children. In her blood and heart there is the force to do this. She tells me she feels much better when she helps the neighbours. I talked about some people I know, but I didn ` t say anything about myself. That`s why I have never done anything for my community. This is because I ` ve never had the occasion, or because I don`t think I would be able to give help without anythingin change. I think that they are very admirable people who do this, but also that you must feel it. I could give some time to my community for example cleaning natural parks when the community of my town organizes an eventcleaning the city. but I am sure I will forget it or I will decide to do something else that day. that`s why really I don`t feel it is my time to give my time to the community. I`m not a good person like my friends.","So it ` s true, there are many people like me who don ` t spend enough time on the community.",1,,,,,,,,

Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes.

969165.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The issue at hand is whether or not young people give enough time to helping their communities. This is an important topic because it relates to community development. In my opinion young people help their communities in many ways which certainly consumes their time. A main reason for this view is that young people often come out to help their communities in times of disaster. For example if an earthquake hits a particular area then youn ones come out in that area to collect the money from all over the world. They advertise it in the paper, on the internet, on TV and everywhere else possible. Not only that, young people earn their salary to help their community. To organise and collect money for such noble causes, it certainly demands time. Thus, young people are giving their valuable time to help their community. Another reason for my point of view is that young people devote a lot of time to research and for carrying out innovations. For example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young people right from the day of their childhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly. Many of them carry out such inventions also. It's also a sort of devoting time towards helping the community. In this way, they also devote time towards helping their community. Lastly, young people often carry out demonstrations in case some epedemics spread in an area.","They, in the evening or some other suitable time, go and tell their people in the community what precautions should be taken to avoid the spread of such epedimics.",1,,,,,,,,

Sometimes, someone asks why he/ or she can get everything that he/or she wants and I can't. In my opinion, the answer is very simple. It is necessary work and I work very hard to achieve my goals. People who are successful have three essential characteristics that frustrated people do not. The first is to take risks all the time, second they are confident in themselves and the last they are positive. First, people who are successful say yes to almost everything to do!. For example, I was working on a project in the pathology laboratory, but a colleague from my field invited me to work on a different project.

339271.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion both types, understanding of ideas and concepts and learning of facts, are important. One reason is, that students who just learn the facts of course have a great data bank but it's just learned by heart, they don't see any connections. To see those connections the students have to take a look at the ideas and concepts of what they learn. Another reason is that students, who just learn by heart everything, are not as able to make a decision as students who see more than just the facts. For example, a history class talks about an important happening in their country's history.

For that you will have to take risks to solve these problems. Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful. I had this often in my personal career.

It was the times that I tried to create new thoughts in my mind and tried to find out why we happened to be alive. Uncle Can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind. I tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic -like I said, I was a little boy then- , which i solved lots of times. However it did not matter how many times I had solved his problems. It just made him create more. Then I understood that it is not just the ""things in his mind"", but there is something more which is socially structured by human beings and our culture. As time goes by, we grow up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society, which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people. When we are talking about society, we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structured situations. In this example that I will give, one may see things more clearly. When I was at elementary school, I just had to pass my courses, then I attended high school, now I had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university. Now I am studying at Bogazici University which is really famous in Turkey. However my missions continue to increase and advance while I am succeeding and going on. This may seem like a story of one.

1164017.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,I think it is a common phenomenon that older people tend to criticize the younger generation for just taking care of themselves and not thinking about the future. For example in Austria this problem has existed for many years and the 68-generation which has been blamed for putting too much attention on the fun parts of life has already started to state their opinions about how bad the current generation is. I don't think it is because the focus shifted to having fun. The reason for the misunderstanding has something to do with development. Because of economic development in many Western countries every generation has started at a much better position than the last one. Many improvements to establishments during the industrial revolution created free time that needed to be filled by something we like to do. When most people were farmers they had not enough time for fun activities like going running or playing soccer because they were too tired after working on the field the whole day. Many developed countries have low weekly working hours and therefore provide space for people to enjoy their time. But of course also the free time culture didn't stop but continued to improve. The new hobbies gained during the time seem like more fun for the older generation who are not able to do these kinds of activities anymore. They are jealous about these new sports (like skateboarding or snow boarding) but forget that their generation also developed new things that seemed strange to their parents.,"I don't think that modern generations have more fun than older ones but instead suggest looking at the cultural, economic and political context in order to judge this question.",1,,,,,,,,

Having so many cars in a confined area brings a lot of problems like pollution, parking problems, accidents without even thinking about the fact that so many cars consume a lot of fuel. Speaking of, it's abundance is dropping dangerously, and of course the price is equally expanding. It's becoming a luxury to drive now. Maybe there will be a restriction at some point, that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week.

288794.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"This is a controversial issue to decide whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to just specialize in one specific subject. Depending on personal experience and emotional concern, we may find that some people will agree with the statement, on the other hand, some people will choose the opposite decision. The choice, nevertheless, is hard to make. However, from my point of view, it is wise to agree with the statement. My auguments are listed as follows.

417184.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think that to be successful people, people can try new things and take risks much more than doing only what they already know how to do well, but when they become successful they often do only one thing. In fact often the person, who becomes successful, does one thing very very well: he knows how to do something and he does it. For example a successful artist does his work very well. But for some other people that don't have particular abilities, a good way to become successful is to try new things and take risks. But when they know how to do something well, they often only do this thing. This is a pity because this behaviour makes their work so boring and i think that there isn't anything that a person can know completely. In every field there is new knowledge, for example in biology scientists discover a lot of new things every year.

1632122.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"For me, as I am one of the young people nowadays, I believe that we should give enough time to helping our community. I would like to introduce our works for our community. In school we are asked to do voluntary work for an exact amount of time. According to my knowledge I believe every school has the same amount of time to do volunteerwork. Our school has to do more than 20 hours of volunteer work for 3 years of junior-high school. This may feel that we are foreced to do it, but even though we are forced to do volunteering, I say we eventually help out the community. Young people nowadays don't only spend time helping their community but also spend a lot of time helping their country. Korea is a small country with no fossil fules or what so ever. The only resource that can help Korea to keep on going to the top would be students' or young people's intelligence. A few days ago I found out that not even Japanese students study as hard as we do. What I also knew was that Korea's students had higher grades in math and science than other countries' students. Many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now. As  a result of this, many parents in Korea's young people are making their children work harder than any bodyelse. for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on.

And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept. Further more, why do we learn ideas and concepts ? For practical work, of course. So, why don't we learn something that is more practical?

I think that this is a very hard time in someone's life they have to obey therule,to be disciplined which can be gloomy and sad.

They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers. They may have little knowledge or even be non-educated, but they have desires to explore the new world. Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there. All these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads young people to be higher, stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people. Another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth. Because of the limitations of age, the old lose lots of enjoyable things. They may be rich and healthy, but they do not have interests in nice food; they can buy a great variety of clothes, but they do not have good looks.

1038759.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Traveling is when a person or group of people move from one place to another either to visit a place or for a particular reason. As traveling has proved to be fundamental for many countries' economies. Many countries in the world benefit from the tourists who come to visit their country as it leads to an increase in the entertainment sector, the hotel sector, the employment sector, the foreign currency which they receive and the infrastructure of that country gradually improves. Yes I do agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First a fall, the tour guide would probably know about the place where the group is traveling. He would have taken the essential measures which are required to be taken for that particular place. Such as a group is travelling to a hostile area where the roads are not properly constructed, the climate is too cold and there are possible chances of being injured. Hence the tour guide would have taken the medical aid equipment, he would have taken care of where to sleep, and he would have made a list of places which are worth visiting. People who travel in a group which is led by a tour guide are relaxed as the guide would have given the list of the equipment which is required, the places to see would already be known and the number of days they are going to visit would be known. Where as if an individual travelled there would be taken precautions there is to be taken he would carry extra things which he would not require. He would have no idea what place to be seen and also what time they are open. He would be worried about various things unlike the people who travel in a group.","Also people who travel in a group are not tense about the initial problem which a traveler faces such as food, where to stay, and who much the trip will cost him in the end as all the group members would have to pay a fixed price.",1,,,,,,,,

935619.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The question has been asked whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for them to learn facts. In my opinion, understanding is definitely more important because it gives the students a chance to explore, a chance to be creative and an unforgettable result. Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topic allows students to go through the investing process. For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literature and find out for themselves that certain techniques add to the perfection of writing. Understanding how they work would give students a better lesson. Getting the concepts and ideas also provides students with a chance to be creative, especially when dealing with are. What kind of art class would it be without studio work? Students should be offered to get creative with colours, textures, moods and all sorts of things. Who cares if they fail once in a while? New creations found in the process of real understanding. Years after years, it is not the definition that students remember, but the unforgettable experience that they learned. Giving out the facts does not provide students with a lot of thoughts of their own. By understanding the ideas and concepts, students gained the ability to conclude the facts themselves.

One of the better examples is when I decided to lose weight, I saw on the television, peels that seemed like magic because without any effort, users could lose a lot of weight and very quickly. Of course, these pills did not work as well as the advertisement said However, it helps me to understand that the purpose of advertisements is to sell a product and to tell the clients what they want to hear. On the one hand, I think it is quite normal for an advertisement to only talk about the advantages of a product, even if it is a kind of lie not to tell the clients everything that they have to know about the product. On the other hand, it can be really annoying for a user to see that it is harder than in the advertisement to make the product work.","For instance, it always makes me laugh when I watch my mother trying to use a very complex oven that she bought because the old one did not have all the functions of the new one.",1,,,,,,,,
736900.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try. Once you begin with one subject ,you will be surprised at what it looks like and try to find out more about it. For example, you are having a toefl test. In this test , you don't know what the test looks like ,because you didn't take the test before. Hence, you will meet lots of difficulties in this test which you didn't predict ahead of time. And several good opportunities are given , and you have to overcome them one by one. Since that, you will know what you will do next time. That can be helpful for being successful. Secondly, knowledge can be an aid to anyone who can help you to be successful. But first of all, how can we get knowledge? The answer is simple, taking risks. In any kindergarten of risks, you must learn some skills to survive. In this process, your knowledge is gained and you are more approachable to success.","If you do what you already know how to do, then you will lose the interest in the thing that you are doing.",1,,,,,,,,

When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you.

Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting. A specialist is the man who soeciallyizes in more than one subject. The famous English detectives in the novels are good at detective and music. Such examples can be seen in every day life.

First of all, it is an important factor to determine whether the person's ability to enjoy life is independent of this person. Independence means the ability to take and perform decisions, and it is almost known that older people have more independence than young people. It is an obstacle for any person to enjoy themselves without having the needed independence to make their decisions. In addition, the vast experience that the older have through their lives will provide them with the ability to take the best decisions that will surely lead them to more enjoyment of life. The last thing is the growth mind that older people have. It is a fact that the person's mind and his intellectual abilities become more and more with time.

1314208.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people think students should learn the result of facts. Even though that is important for students, I myself believe comprehension of ideas and concepts are more necessary for modern life. People are able to manage their skills in their life easily. For example, when a person knows how to figure out math concepts, the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programming field. If the person wants to be a computer programmer, the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business. Learning facts is risky to interfere with students' motivation. It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover themselves to solve the problems. For example, in math class students always spend a lot of time considering to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process helps students to make motivation for studying. Finally, learning only results is not always true.","Again, math class could be a good example.",1,,,,,,,,

170042.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes, I agree with this statement. Many companies make advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are. The companies do anything in order to sell their product eventhough they know that they are selling something that is not true. Many customers believe everything they see and buy the product if they see that the information that the company is giving them about the products makes it seem good. Because of the people that buy things when they see them in the advertisements companies think that it is a smart way to sell and will continue using it until someone puts a stop to it. An example from everyday life is when you want your parents to give you permission to do something you know is not right, in this case you tell your mom all thegood things about it and leave out all the bad things that it has and could have. Everyday, people say the things that favor them in order to obtain what they want or in order to sell their product. The big companies that have taken out the smaller companies of the cities convince people really easily of their product just by placing their products as if it where better that the others and the people would go directly to the larger companies that lie about the quality of their product. When a company tells you that it is guaranteed for life they have thought really well what the possibilities are that it has for a person to claim that guarantee. When a company guarantees a product for life, it is a way to persuade people into buying it because it makes it look like it is the best product of all and they are so sure of it that they gurantee it for life so you will buy it. The advertisements are a way to sell your product quicker and easier. Every company knows what they can put in their advertisements in order to make them seem better than they really are without the possibility of being later blamed by the customers that the products aren't really what they told them to be.",Every advertisement has little letters written below in order to justify what they write in big letters.,1,,,,,,,,

Traffic jams can seriously attack the economy. It can affect the run of the economic system. For example , traffic jams can delay the conveyance of goods of different industries, They can lower the productivity of the whole economy, Since that,different governments of big cities will tightly control the number of cars.

Humans learn the whole life and are always improving ways to get a larger knowledge. While studying everyone should decide about the level of deepness about a certain academic subject. The knowledge could be useful, but a lot of times it happens that it doesn't have any purposes in real life. For some academics it is important to learn a huge amount of knowledge and it is easier for them to get an overview of information while making a decision. These people need jobs with tasks like combining different aspects for a certain problem. For instance, a manager who has to check out all kinds of consequences for a problem. A basis for this is to have broad knowledge to find the best solution to the problem. Another example could be a doctor who cares for general sicknesses. He has to know about several looks of diseases to offer a quick help in a proper way. Sometimes it is also important to have a specialist on a certain subject who is able to solve the problem faster than someone who has just an general idea of the subject. For instance, a doctor in a hospital which is specialised in cancer. He would be able to help with a professional look at some cells without reading a book first or fulfilling some experiments. Both ways of studying are good ways to find a profession, because in reality either way is necessary. It depends on the subject and the profession.

And I found that from my experience and from what I heard from my relatives and friends. Although advertisements sometimes are necessary, there are still a lot of deceiving and misleading things to customers. Also for me is a waste oftime seeing , hearingand reading advertisements. From my own experience I saw an advertisement on the TV about a medicine that would relieve the pain in feet and it was very attractive, so I called for it and after using it for a long time nothing changed. And I heard a lot of stories from my friends and relatives and the same things happened occasionally to them in other stuff that they bought. I know it is sometimes there are advantages from commercials, they will expose as to the new and developed technology, materials and a lot of things. But still there are other ways to know about these things from other sources like departmental research and from the experience of others. I believe commercials were a lot of my time a lot for a lot of reasons, it takes time from me when viewing programs on TV, like news, shows, sports and almost every thing.

There are other ways of transportation for example planes. They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople. Nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country advances. Cars are effective for transportation for many people The third reason for not agreeing with this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes. They should be very expensive changes, that are needed to compensate for the need for transportation of the increasing population of the world. Installing a new system is required and for this system many new research should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again.","To conclude, as i stated in the reasons above there will be more cars than now in twenty years.",1,,,,,,,,

1963659.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Over the years of experience in human history there is a clear evidence that there is always a good reputation or a need for people who specialise in a particular field or subject of study. And there is always a need for specialists. There is always a need for specialists in society rather than people who have no deep knowledge of a particular field. I strongly believe people who specialise in a certain field of academics are more efficient and worthy than an individual who has broader knowledge of many subjects. In this context, there can be numerous examples that can be stated among which i would like to state two which are as follows: Firstly,in the case of a doctor,one cannot go to a general physician for a heart problem. Because the general physician has only the common knowledge of the general problems of the heart, it is a heart surgeon or a cardiac specialist who can treat the patient suffering from heart ailments. Here it can be clearly seen that a doctor who has knowledge of all the areas of medicine cannot treat a patient who has serious problems with his heart So, there is an obvious need for a specialist.","Secondly, in childhood you learn all the subjects as your acedamics but as you grow older you have to select some special subjects and learn them,it is only because one cannot master all the subjects and get good knowledge about everything.",1,,,,,,,,

1148903.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The real cliche advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yogurt in a terrific place such as a nice dessert island. Indeed very often the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it is actually. This is really true when we talk about advertisements for goods such as food, cars, clothes. However it is not really the product that is shown to be much better than it is but rather what is around the product. Apparently you always need a cute girl, a handsome guy or a vast shiny house to sell a sausage or a. Tshirt. So it is more the stuff unconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is. Nevertheless in some cases the product is not shown as better than it is. In particular when it is an advertisement not on goods but on services. For example the advertisements are sensibilising on security on the road, or the ad concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances. In those cases the advertisement is more serious and there are fewerlies. All things considered I agree that very often the y, but it is not the least surprising and ; most people are aware of it. The goal is to create a need and to increase the sales.",In a nutshell i would say that advertising is trying to make products seem much better than in reality but it is oftentimes true for goods and less for services.,1,,,,,,,,
457645.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, many people believe that young people are very selfish and they don't do anything for their community. But, I disagree with this kind of opinion. From a long time ago, people have complained about being younger than them. However, nowadays younger people volunteer in many fields for their community and they study very hard. First of all, we can find many young students to volunteer in many places. Of course, some schools need some volunteer work for their credit. Even though, there are many students doing it just for helping their community. For example, we can see many young people volunteering in the orphanage or hospital or school. They can be very helpful in this kind of place. Because,in the hospital or orphanage, there are many people who desire help. But the supply is very lacking compared to the demand. The young people compensate for the gap. How appreciable a thing it is. Furthermore, many young people study hard and work for their future and their community Actually healthy minded young people can be very important resources for their community. They take responsibility for the future of their society and the results, it can be the most helpful thing for society. For example, if young people neglect their duty in society, it can be a very miserable thing for the community. Because they are our future by themselves. Fortunately, most young people take responsibility, it can naturally predict a positive future. To sum up, many students give enough time to helping their society by volunteering and studying or working.","As I considered, our society's future is very bright because of appreciable young people.",1,,,,,,,,
1644003.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Must people try new things and take risks in order to achieve success? In my opinion the answer to this question in a world that is changing all day is ""yes"", for the next reasons. First, this is a learning world. I mean, a lot of knowledge and information is produced everyday, so people who want to succeed have to be available to learn new things every day. Some researchers have found that people must change their major aor career once in their life. Second, in business there are a lot of stories where people that don't take a risk and take a chance, lose a lot of money. Besides, the people who innovate have success. Examples of that are the transistor in the electronics business and the digital watch, that came to Japan from the first world after the second world war. Other countries with more advantages than Japan did not want to take the risk. Japan did it and now it is one of the most important economies in the world. Also, It is easy to find a lot of personal stories of success around new technologies and the Internet. Yahoo, Google and You Tube based their success on a strange idea, work with out direct pay.","So they offer a lot of services like mail, search information and hosting web pages and videos without receiving any pay.",1,,,,,,,,

It is true in some respects because young people have more alternations for enjoying life and many leisure equipment has been inventedgradually.

They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer.

1238869.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree with the statement that young people's not give enough time to helping their communities. It is my belief that, there are several reasons that cause this situation. But, not only young people, but also the environmental situations are the reasons for this problem. This problem may be first explained by the changes in young people. It is my belief that we are getting more selfish from generation to generation and starting to think only about ourselves. A few years ago, when our country was in a difficult situation, everyone had the consciousness to do something for his/her country, but now we only think about what we can do to save ourselves. One of the causes of this problem is the consciousness that is given to young people in their home, by their parents. The most important place where a person learns most of the things that he/she will use during his/her life is his/her home. In the older times, parents were more careful about this situation, but as time passed, as the problems of the parents increased about their children, giving community consciousness is not anymore an important problem for the family. Another place, that where young people are educated is school. At school, the teachers are the people who are responsible for teaching the importance of the community and helping these children. Teachers should give the conscious, explain the good ways of helping the community and describe the positive things that they will gain by helping the community to the students. For example the teachers should explain the difficulties that people have who have mental disorders to  theirstudents. In this way he/she can affect the students and cause them to want to help thosepeople. We should start thinking about our community again and trying for someone else. Helping someone else makes the people feel proud of him/herself and causes them to feel good.","If we do not help our community, we can not expect anything from our community.",1,,,,,,,,

A tour guide knows the area well and therefore, will guide the tourist to the most remarkable and worthwhile spots of a city. Commonly the guide is familiar with the historical background of the area, and will be able to explain the landmarks and the development of a metropolis. Besides the well-known highlights, a guide will also be aware of secret spots and so, allow the tourist to be introduced to the side of an area that is out of the spot light.","That will not only show an often charming and different side of a city, but also complete the big picture.",1,,,,,,,,

That will not only show an often charming and different side of a city, but also complete the big picture. In addition to that, guided explorations are safer since a person who is familiar with the area will also know the unsafe places where it is not recommended to go. On the other hand, traveling without a guide is more of an adventure. It is up to the traveling group to explore the city and to find both, the landmarks and the secret spots. The travellers are more likely to get in touch with locals since they are not as isolated from the ""normal crowd"" within a group of guided tourists. I also believe that travellers will experience a trip differently, if it is not organized perfectly by a guide. Travelling people can set their own pace and adjust the amount of daily explorations to their actual ability to concentrate which makes a trip less exhausting and more pleasant.","I frankly, I believe that travelling without a guide is the best way to explore a city.",1,,,,,,,,

I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress.

1400152.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Academic subjects that a student takes will help him get into the school, college or the university that he wants. What subjects should a student study? How many subjects should he/she study? All these questions confuse each and every student in the whole world. If a student specialises in one specific subject, he/she will have many advantages and disadvantages facing him. Starting with the advantages, we will find that this student will feel comfortable and happy as there will be no pressure on him. Moreover, the student will know what he/she is going to specialise in as he/she gets into college or university and will not have the trouble of being confused later in his life. However, the student will face lots of trouble if the specialisation does not suit him. And if the student wishes to change the subject, this will not benefit him/her as he/she will have to start all over again and waste lots of time; and as I was once told ""time is like gold, if you do not benefit from it you will lose it"". On the other hand, if a student has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he/she will have fewer disadvantages than the advantages. Firstly, he/she will switch into any other specialisation when it feels like it, if the student finds that the first one did not suit him/her without wasting any time. Furthermore, this will help the student in his/her life outside university as he/she will have lots of general and specific information and knowledge. In my opinion the only disadvantage here, is that he/she will have huge pressure on him and will have lots of hard times. Summing up all those ideas, I agree with the statement and would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.","Although I will have a hard time, this will save me the trouble of facing the above disadvantages.",1,,,,,,,,
1126472.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people, for several reasons. The reasons are namely; young people are more energetic, they are healtier and they do not have concern for casualities. Being energetic is very important to enjoy life, as it is the key to engaging in entertaining activities like sports, dancing and going out with friends. I am sure that no old person has the energy to do any of these things, as most of us have seen in our grand parents. The second reason is related very much to age, due to the fact that a person is healthier if he or she is young. I think this is also very closely related to engaging in entertaining activities; you might have observed your self when you are sick, which is a case that no body would like to go out to have fun. Due to the fact that old people usually suffer from chronic or acute illnesses, they are less likely to have motivation to engage in activities, rather they are likely to stay in bed all day. Approaching to the end, If we come to the third reason; which is lack of concern for casualities, I think it is appropriate to state that this is the most prominent character of young people and is the leading factor in enjoying life. When a person has a lot of responsibility to be accounted for, it will be very hard for that person to think about having fun, The only thing to do in that case is to look for solutions to existing problems. In old age, people usually have to deal with their illnesses and with their possible problems with their children if they are still living together.","While dealing with these problems, it can not be expected from a person to enjoy life.",1,,,,,,,,

1099127.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The idea that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts neither looks logical nor rational. I would completely disagree with that idea for a lot of reasons. I do think that in order for young people to learn facts of life and science in different specialities in order to be able to have the ideas of their own,otherwise they will just come up with mixed out ideas and concepts. So it is a sort of chronological process. I do not think for example how a student could come up with a certain invention or innovation in a certain machine or subject without clearly taking in all the basic facts of how this machine is working and the basic scientific factors controlling its function or he may end up with catastrophe. Another reason, is that the study of facts broadens the horizon of the student's vision ,then he will be quite capable of finding out the concepts and basic ideas by himself, by studying how every thing in life would work correctly. It is only after passing that stage of basic learning that his ability to investigate and relate new concepts and theories. Young students tend to be arrogant if they believe that they know concepts and ideas,that would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the facts and be able to use them in the proper context.","And last but not least , education is an active process, and unless the students are forced from their youth to learn hard and given facts and certain assignments they will be reluctant to offer any thing useful to the world or be aids to the world's progress.",1,,,,,,,,

339750.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I'm completely agree with this sentence. In fact I believe that I live in the generation of advertising. In this period what the people say is more important than the real qualities of a product. On televisions or on the pages of newspapers there is always an infinity of sponsored products: shoes, t-shirts, caps, but also hams, biscuits or different types of cheese. We can find all types of product. All day my favourite football player or the champion of the world of tennis suggest to me what is the product better for me and how I have spent my time. And I don't buy a particular object only for its qualities or its price, but also because I see it in a journal. This is the scope of marketing: ""to make products better than they really are"". This is an economic law and some firms know it very well. The same product with different brands has two different values, it is caused by continuous advertising.","Really these products are not better than other without a famous brand, often they are products of low quality, but only with a good testimonial or a good sponsor.",1,,,,,,,,

I found understanding of concepts more beneficial in many fields and ways because by understanding the idea we know how to apply it easily and effectively. for example in solving a physics problem if you understand the concept you can do it easily and accurately in a few minutes compared to others. another example if we understand a surgical procedure thoroughly we can perform it with fewercomplications.

The prediction, nevertheless, is difficult to make. As far as I am concerned, the number of cars in twenty years will increase in developing countries. On the other hand decrease in developed countries. Among those countless factors that affect my opinion, I would only explore a few primary ones as follows. The essential reason why cars in developing countries will become more and more in 20 years is that developing countries are more likely to develop their industry as their first goal in the following years. As a result, the car, an important criteria to show the level of the development of a developing country, will be more and more under the leadership of the government. A good case in point is the faster and faster growing number of cars in China. The government of the country has recently imported the core technology of car-manufacturing from some Japanese company. This would lead to the decline of the price of cars in the domestic market to encourage people to buy cars. So, there is no doubt that there will be more and more cars in China. Therefore, I believe that in developing countries, there will be more and more cars.",And an important reason for the decrease in the number of cars in developed countries is that the developed countries are paying more attention to the protection of the environment in recent years.,1,,,,,,,,

1361043.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is a fact. Adversetising is the engine of many companies all around the world, companies that could not sell a unit of their products if they could not have access to advertising agencies. For example, everyone is aware of the dangers of drinking soda but because the companies that produce soda invest millions of dollars inadvertising, they keep selling millions of units all around the world. Another clear example that supports the statement is tobacco companies; companies like the worldwide company Phillips-Morris whose business is to sell as many cigarettes as they can, even though they are aware of the consequences of smokingas their customers do, they keep increasing their profits year after year because they great invest inadvertising, this is what permits them to show their product as something that is neither bad nor good, just as something that exists. Usually many products fail because of their marketing policies, some companies with really good products have declared bankruptcy after putting out their products without good marketing support or many companies with regular products have been successful because of it; one example of this, is that millions of clothes companies exist around the world but not all of them are known in different countries and they do not sell as the known ones do; many brands are sold in the world, brands like Tommy Hilfigher, Diesel, Perry Ellis among many, but it is not their quality or any other specific characteristics that these brands have that permit them to succeed over the companies that have no marketing policy.","In summary there is no statement that can be so real as ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"".",1,,,,,,,,

1296943.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Recently, it is said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with this opinion, because young people nowadays are so busy with their own things, and they have a poor ability for communication, and they regard the community as not so important. First, young people are very busy, because they need to go to prep school after school. In japan, at the end of primary school, there are entrance examinations to junior highschool. So they need to study hard. Moreover they learn many kinds of things, for example, tennis, swimming, piano, something like that. After entering university, they are busy with social life such as parties, part-time jobs, dates. There is no time to spend on their communities. Secondly, young people do not know how to communicate with many kinds of people. Usually they are grown up in small families, so they are not good at communicating with other people except their family or school mates. So it is difficult to communicate with them. Thirdly, young people regard community activity as not so important. Some of them are busy with theirselves, so they think that it is useless to attend the community's activities. For these reasons, I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.","It is a pity,but it is a real situation in Japan.",1,,,,,,,,
1156164.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I agree with the statement given here that ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guide"" My first reason is,as we go to a new place,we may not know how the place will be,how the behaviour of the people will be,what their culture is,what their customs are etc. If we go to some american countries,we may find some difficulty ,understanding their language and also we cannot understand their accent eventhough they speak english.

My second reason is,if the place you planned to tour is a historic place without a guide,you finally end up with the crooked structures you saw there. As each historic place has a history behind its main purpose is to know its history. As we are not familiar with the place and its history,a guide is the right person to explain it. For example,take the instance of mahabalipuram,a famous historic site in India. It's all filled with temples made ofrock, carrying on stone etc. We need a guide to explain what rocky scenery is like.

1258000.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Well i think it ` s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first question is, what are old people, and what are young people? It mainly depends on the person. Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and elderly people are about 60 years old. In this case, young people have other interests than elderly people have. For example, young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music, whereas elderly people are enjoying a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the background. But i have to mention, that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music. For example the generation who grows up with Rolling Stones or AC DC still go to their concerts. The only difference is, that young people are normally in better shape than elderly people are. The older you are the more problems you are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can do more sports. Elderly people have to care more about themselves. Maybe young people are often more flexible but this is also a stereotype. After all, this is not very important to enjoy life. Usually, elderly people can do the same things as younger people can do if they are careful. They even have one important advantage, because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have. If they have enough money, they can fly or travel to each place where they want to, whereas the younger ones have to go to school, to university or to work. The young people either haven`t enough money to do things or they haven`t enough time.","Like i have written at the beginning of this text, how you enjoy life depends on your personality and on your flexibility.",1,,,,,,,,

First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot.

542946.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"In Japan, some people think that young people have given enough time to help their communities recently. However, I agree with the idea that young people do not do that for the following reasons. First, young people nowadays have seldom opportunities to help their communities. For example, when I was a student at secondary school in 1990, I lived in Nagoya, which is the fourth largest city in Japan.","In Nagoya, there were some rules in my community that people had to gather once a month, and had to pick up trash on the roads near our community.",1,,,,,,,,

In Nagoya, there were some rules in my community that people had to gather once a month, and had to pick up trash on the roads near our community. Young people and children are also required to attend the activity. It takes about two hours at one time, but I could contribute to the community. But now, there is no activity like that in my community and I hardly hear the existence of such an activity from my friends. This example demonstrates that I strongly believe that there are not enough opportunities for young people to help their communities. Second, young people nowadays have little sense of belonging to their communities. For instance, when I lived in Nagoya, the neighbours were so kind that there were many opportunities to meet them.","I thought that the neighbours were close to me, and that the community was important to me.",1,,,,,,,,

1818733.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Many people cannot decide whether having broad knowledge about academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for an individual's career. In my opinion, people should focus on one topic and specialize in it. By having deep information and significant experiences on an issue, people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job, salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area. The first advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compared to other people. Because, companies today generally look for people with a specific topic. The reason for this is that today's companies are working on a detailed subject. It is clearly seen that there are not so many companies that work in different areas. Therefore, this situation pushed the companies to find people that have important experiences and knowledge about their job. Secondly, in today's world, if a person is an expert in an issue, then this person takes a high salary compared to other employees. Because it is hard to find an expert for companies for a job position. Therefore, big companies can give high salaries to these people. Finally, technology forces people to become experts.","The main reason for this is that technology is developing day by day and it is not possible to have ""enough"" information about a topic.",1,,,,,,,,

I think also that if one person can understand the concept of a problem will be able to describe the fact.

Another very important thing is that the teacher must be very able to explain the concept : he must speak slowly and he must be sure that all the students have understood what he wants to say. To be sure he should ask his students if the concept is clear every time before going on with his explanation. The fact that it is more important for students to understand ideas is more valid for logical and scientifical disciplines, where the most important thing is to understand the method.","Disciplines like story and geography need these students to be able to remember facts and names, but also, in this case it is very important that these students understand the concept as, for example , the ways a historical fact has happened, which are the motives that make it happen.",1,,,,,,,,
1244220.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons. Firstly, if a person is focused on a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge, because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field. Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people to know many things from a superficial view; it is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field. I can concide that broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff. But that is not usually the common case because most people work in medium or large companies.","Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders themselves, which highlights the importance of specialization."

Some people say the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour suicide, but I disagree with that. The first reason is that we have to go with other people who we do not like. This is a big deal ,such as when I went to the Europ, the guy who was very old, brought a Denjang which smelledbad, and he ate this in the restaurant when the bread came out. The other native people cover their nose with their hand, and I feel bad because They will Think the Koreans are bad.

1067059.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the statement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than going for many. Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail.

450321.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts. My choice is based on two reasons. The first reason is that, if you learn facts, you have direct contact with reality. For example, at university, you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than if you follow a lesson of theory. This is a good way not only for a student, but also for a worker.","In fact, if a worker has worked all of the day, he or she learns more things than if he or she follows a lesson of theory.",1,,,,,,,,

Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts.

Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me an example of how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system.

When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them.",Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something.,1,,,,,,,,

1183664.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes, I agree with the sentence because most of the advertisements are false and they induce people to buy them when their quality is very low. The producers should think less about the sales than about the wealth of the people that will buy the product for example, if the product is food. The advertisement ought to be more strict to the reality to show to the watchers the real characteristics of each product. In this way a citizen can choose the best. In my opinion, all the producers will make their thoughts better and all the words said in an advertising space will be perceived and listened to better. By the way I considered the advertising spaces a waste of time and I don't listen to them because, according to me, they are all made to seem like what they aren't. Unfortunately, in my life, I have bought a lot of products that seemed much better than they really were, but after one purchase I didn't buy them another time.","Instead, if the advertisements were real and described exactly what they show, people would believe in them still.",1,,,,,,,,
1659389.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In the world, there are people who succeeded in their business. I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because society is always interested in new products and it is more effective to provide new products faster compared to its competitors. One of the reasons that I agree with the statement is that the customers always aim to have new goods or services. In the recent society that has a large number of goods and services, people tend to be bored with keeping seeing the same products. They always want new or interesting products that are different from the others. Apple, the computer company, is one of the effective examples. A few years ago, it invented a music player called iPod. It can hold a larger quantity of music than others. It soon became famous that all people have one of them. Another reason is that people who provided a new product earlier than its competitors become famous. For example, TOYOTA, a Japanese car company, succeeded in its business by producing a new type of car, high-hybrid car. The high-hybrid cars use only a small amount of gasoline compared to the cars from other car companies. Since the gas price has been high in recent years, people tend to buy cars that consume less gasoline.","For now, a lot of companies produce high-hybrid cars.",1,,,,,,,,
1758531.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yeh , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, because it will help them to have a grip on the concept. Studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student, the student's knowledge develops only when he thinks about the topic. How did he/she get that thinking? once if they are having some grasp or idea on the topic. The student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity. I am agreeing with the concept because I have had practical experience once up on a time. Two students in my class attended an exam full of practice. I am explaining the practice module of both of the students, one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day without any breakage and also without any idea. And the other person who is also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept. After they arrived after the exam one of the people who prepared the whole night without any breakage told me that the question papper is very hard and I didnt understand the concept of the papper. But the other person told me that the question paper is very easy to answer ,I answered in 1 hour out of 2hours. That much is easy the exam is. he told me like that I could nt get first why they were telling me like that , when asked both of them how they studied I got the answer to my question.",On that day itself I understood that instead of memorising the words we will go for understanding which will be very helpful to the person to develop in any way.,1,,,,,,,,
1169848.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I would have to agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. As more and more cars are rapidly produced today, the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportation throughout a nation. The space allocated for the vehicles will soon not be enough. Population growth directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road. Highways of hundreds of metres tall will anyway be fully congested with drivers. With limited spaces or lands throughout a country, any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of cars on the road, which also could cause pollution. As do the government here in Malaysia, they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road. One move that was made to the Malaysian government to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes.","By imposing a heavy percentage of taxes on imported as well as local cars, it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find an alternative mode of transport.",1,,,,,,,,

When we are young it is very useful to try a lot of subjects but when you grow up things change. Now I am not anymore interested in playing music or doing mathematics exercises so I am naturally going to specialize in what I like. Thus I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. First of all, I really want to know more about a subject which really interests me, namely the Economists. So It is obvious that I am an Economy student at University. Although I have already spent three years in those studies and I think that is more and more interesting. My knowledge of Economics has increased a lot but I still want to learn more, I already know a lot of the main theories of Economists as Karl Marx, Adam Smith, Keynes. Thus those knowledges are very useful for my studies, They allow me to make my own economic theory. The second reason why I think it is better to be specialized is to be a specialist in the field of Economics. I want to teach order to transmit my knowledge to the new generation of students and to make them attract by economic research to improve their everyday life nowadays. In my field I think most of the students are not really interested in economics, which is what I want to change in the future, I want students to love economics the same way i do. To conclude It is better to specialize in one specific subject and now I want to be specialized in the Economy of development to help developing countries to have a better standard of living and to get out of poverty.",The economy influences many kinds of political and environmental decisions so it is actually very important to understand the main mechanisms of how the economyoccurs.,1,,,,,,,,

In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree.

In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree.

For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city environmental problems are so serious. Originally Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had not so much a train network. However, the South Korean government improved the capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people. The government will continue such efforts to make Seoul's air clean. Trains seem to replace the car-centric traffic system. As the above example demonstrates, there will be fewer cars today. Third, the reasons people buy cars are more limited than before. The car is not only a means of transport but also a symbol of rich life. However, people will change such an image of cars. For example, in European countries, where many people use cars for the first time in the world, simple cars are popular because many Europeans think cars are just a traffic method.","In the old days, people in Europe loved rich cars, though, such thinking is changing.",1,,,,,,,,

For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think.

There are so many advertisements in the world and companies want people to be interested in their products. Besides, to make interesting advertisements, they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points. First, most advertisements are made to grab people's eyes.

However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry for her and regretted focusing on just the quantity of the feasible time. In addition, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never shows one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is an example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyers in Korea. He is renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedication to society.

There should be an energy when young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the environment they live in. It is sad that people can't see young people attending the activities of their communities. The reasons that cause this situation are competition, education and value. First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate in any activities. There is more stress on their shoulders, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and perform well in school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes. They have to sacrifice their playing time to achieve their goal. They try to get into a public university because the tuition is higher than before. There are many people who may not afford it. What a stress on them and it makes young people ca' t help their communities. Second, there is something wrong with education. Young people didn't get the right messages from education. As long as people live in a place and a society, they do have responsibility for participating in any activity and sharing their view. Just like a family, there are four members in the family, and everyone should share the chore with each other, not just parents only. When people get involved with it, they will feel belonging and more thoughtful for others.

1881835.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Idears and facts can be thought of as two different parts of a song. Idears like the melody of a song and the facts like the lyrics of the song. Both of them are important, however, if we change the lyrics of a song, it seems it is still a song and just with different meaning, but if we change the melody of the song, sometimes, it may not be a song or it is already another song. Comparing these two different parts, I agree that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. First, I believe ideas and concepts of knowledge are the main core as the most important part during our learning. There are millions and millions of facts about each subject, and it is impossible for us if we want to get detailed aspact of the facts, even though we spend our whole college life learning them. So the best way of acquiring knowledge is to get the main idea or concepts in the first step, and then pick up some relative facts to help us understand it and express it. On the other hand, it is not necessary to learn all the facts but we must get the ideas and concepts, even when we do the extra-activities.

Some people think the opposite, they think that it is better and useful to learn facts, they are against theory, but without theory, it is more difficult to learn facts. Learning some concepts or ideas is necessary, it is the basis to achieve good results. For example at university: if students don't study some essential concepts in some subjects, they don't understand the gist of that subject and the study should become a waste of time. Books have this purpose: telling the most important information, ideas about a specific argument. For example: students that want to become a doctor, before working have to learn some important concepts, they must know the human body. In every field of study, law, engineering, science it is necessary to have an abstract knowledge of the subject.

That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist.

625750.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I neither agree, nor disagree with that statement. I think actually both are important. Let me give a personal story that helped me to draw a conclusion to this question. The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of facts -knowledge and who in fact do not read the newspapers"". Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact do not exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view. For example the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was often called a big actor, a pretender. A lot of people were convinced, that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programmes from his party or important political decisions. And in fact, I often thought similarly- until I met him one day. It was a rainy sunday and some friends of mine and I were walking through the bars of Berlin. Then Mr Schroeder suddenly stood at our table and asked If we knew where the toilet was. It followed what always follows, we drank, we laughed and we were talking about politics, as soon as he was back from the restroom.","But my personal lesson from that meeting was - If somebody is able to make a successful career, wherever that happens, he needs to understand fundamental ideas and concepts first - and then he has to know facts.",1,,,,,,,,

One question is often debated whether students should concentrate and focus more on understanding ideas and concepts or to learn facts. Although understanding ideas and concepts are important, in general, I think learning facts is essential for students for several reasons.

For example, when I was a child, I learned in school, especially in the biology class, many facts that helped to understand how the plants and the animals live and grow, then I got a different perspective on the whole world.

Nowadays it's more difficult for young people to find a job than in the past. They must study very much and work hard to increase their chances. Competition is a key point that stimulates people who need to also be as skilled as possible. So they need to attend university and more time is required to finish their studies. For the same reason, their parents have less time to look after and educate them, especially if the mother is not doing housework. In fact, society's demand is greater than in the past in all fields, and it requires more speed. So people run from one place to another to respect their appointments.

1144447.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People usually say that young people are the future of our society. It is because they have much more time to think about their rest of their lives and their futures. In addition they have a lot of opportunities to learn and try what they want. Moreover, young people are usually very healthy to do something hard that they face on. Therefore, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Firstly, older people have less time to consider and have already experienced many things that they can enjoy their lives. Young people are literally 'young', so they have lots of time to think about their lives. Also they have many more opportunities to learn and try what they want than order people. For example, young people have a lot of dreams in their futures ,so they always consider what they really want to be. Therefore, they spend a lot of time learning new things that they have never experienced, but older people already experienced most of the things in their lives so not a lot of things are left for them. In addition, young people have an enthusiasm to try new and hard things which can definitely enjoy their lives. Although things are hard and difficult, they have a youth passion to figure out but old people are not really fascinated by difficult and dangerous fields. Secondly, older people are not often healtier than young people. For instance, older people can not run as fast as young people. Therefore, although older people want to hike Rocky Mountain, they can afford to hike as much as they want. On the other hand, young people are very healthy to try whatever they want, even though things are very difficult and dangerous. In addition, although they get injured, their bodies easily get better than older people. In conclusion, young people have much more time to enjoy their lives such as thinking about their future, learning new skills and experiencing new things. Moreover they are healthier to enjoy these new experiences and skills than older people.","Therefore, young people enjoy their lives more than older people do.",1,,,,,,,,

I disagree with the above statement because, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems to be alright when in childhood, but this seems to be complex and cumbersome as we grow older and older. Firstly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly. For example, consider a high school student.","If he needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school, apart from his personal interest which he shows in a particular subject, the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome.",1,,,,,,,,
1001213.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","From my point of view, I do not think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Some people believe this because they think that in twenty years, perhaps, the world will have changed so much that we will use flying objects to go from one place to another and that, moreover, we will transport things by putting them into a machine, pressing a button, and, suddenly, they will appear thousands of kilometres away from where they were. When I was young everybody said that in the year two thousand everything was going to be different and that what I've said above would have already happened, but these didn't come true. Nowadays things are quite similar to what they were twenty years ago. Cars are so important in our lives that we cannot live without them. Nowadays we need our cars to transport things, to go to many places where public transport does n't go and to feel a bit more free. On the other hand, it's true that if public transport became cheaper and quicker, many people wouldn't need their car, and they would take public transport, but, what about feeling free? Our society needs to feel really free, and to feel that they can go wherever they want, whenever they want.","We are absolutely under control in our cities and in our countries and, as I think, cars give us this bit of freedom that we do not have in many other parts of our lives.",1,,,,,,,,

1046238.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Concerns about global warming and cuts to green house effect gases tend to make us believe that in the future, there will be fewer cars than there are today. However, I feel that this assumption is a bit rough and should be balanced. To put it straight I do not think that there will be a dramatic decrease in the number of cars. At least I do not think that it will occur everywhere. First, the car is a means of transportation and the advantages of which are somewhat hard to challenge. It is probably the only means of transportation combining speed, 24/7 instant availability, high standard of comfort, security against attacks and possibility to reach in a decent number of hours any withdrawn place in a country. All other long distance means of transportation make you dependent on departure times, exasperating delays and complicated correspondances. For all these reasons I do not believe that the need for cars will fall. What makes us think of an upcoming abandonment of cars is the feeling that huge expense is done to incite people not to take their cars in city centers. In France, for instance, constant effort is made to improve the standard of service of railway networks in major towns.","For example, the city of Paris is building a tramway network at the moment.",1,,,,,,,,
216699.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago.

It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip. However, when I go somewhere I don't know very much, I'd like to research first and study about the place I will go to and the language they speak there. In this process, I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research. Also if you study the language of the country you will go to , you don't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food. While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat. You have to eat certain food the tour guide has already set up for the group. When you travel, you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended. I am sure a tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat, but you have no choice but to eat something else. Even for the food, I want to research what is the most popular food in that country and I will figure out whether I can eat this food or not. If not, of course I will look for another place to go. Finally, traveling is all about experiencing new things from a new world at least I think. I don't want to have the same experience as other people have. With group touring, you have to go to the same place and take a picture of a certain place like others.",The whole group will have the same memories from the trip.,1,,,,,,,,

Most young people want to go travelling but they do not have enough money and time to do it. Most young people have to work and it is difficult to take a vacation. However most retired older people have a lot of time, the y have some money to enjoy their life because they are getting retirement money from the government. Now, there are dating clubs for seniors in Japan. These are very famous in Japan. The daiting club is for senior citizens who don ` t have a partner because of a partner's death or divorce. Even though they are old like 60, 70, 80 years old, they can participate inthe club.

If you skip something , you will meet trouble in the end. Speaking again, If you ignore the process of understanding accurately, you will find you didn't even know an easy thing.

First of all I believe that just like there are allways different views of life their are also different ways of enjoying life. For example for a kid, a life full of joy may be defined by the ability to run and play. For a teenager joy may be in the art of being in love or taking risks and learning. Then again an elderly person may experience the same amount of joy as a young person just by lying down on a hammock on a sunny afternoon to remember beautifultimes, or to read his favorite novel. For example if I was an elder I would love to recall my past experiences with women and tell them to my grandsons. And the stories of grandma and I to my granddaughter. And then again as I am young there is the beauty of learning and experiencing what I will later tell my grandchildren.",There is a time for everything and in these times you may enjoy life in many different ways.,1,,,,,,,,
1066286.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Academic knowledge and experience is a very essential toolbox for the improvement of human beings and the development of civilizations. It has always been a controversial issue over the years to decide whether it is favorable to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or focus on one specific academic discipline. However I agree that it is really more valuable to get a broad knowledge of different academic disciplines especially in the 21stcentury. There are several explanations for this statement like accelerating information bombing through rapidly increasing technology and the passion for learning as much as possible. The rapidly developing information technologies have led people to reach all kinds of data easily. In the new world of academic subjects where the information is passed quickly and interdependent, it is better to get involved in different sources of academic topics and increase the vision. Moreover the inspiration taken from different disciplines definitely increases the level of awareness related to a lot of topics. Which in turn makes the person stronger and gives him/her the power to challenge the status. Another important rationale of gathering different academic subjects is that people should have a kind of learning and defining instinct for the world. This is a god given motivation for people and if they follow this instinct they have to fill in the blanks they have in their minds related to various topics.","In conclusion, different academic disciplines and approaches give the person the chance to widen the knowledge scope of the world while contributing to having different points of views from the person.",1,,,,,,,,

All the big scientific discoveries depend on the observation of facts, but on the other hand it is important to know all the theories related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of the facts we are observing. To give an order to this matter I think that first (in a temporary order, not for its importance) students need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts, so in the first part of students' formation it is necessary for them to learn as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the matter and after they can understand and remember much more easily all facts connected with their studies. for example if you are studying the atomic structure, of course you need to know everything about chemistry and related theories. This example feats quite well to this essay, especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission.","It happened that the woman, who was of course a physicist and had studied a lot of theory, was observing the facts about accelerated neutrons pushed against the nuclear part of a not stable atom.",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"For example, a physicist who had studied a lot of theory was observing the facts about accelerated neutrons pushed against the nuclear part of an unstable atom."
1950114.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays due to the fact of a changing economic situation which asks for highly skilled and qualified people and makes it even more difficult to get a suitable job, it is more important for students to gain the ability to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is to learn facts in order to be special on the job market. At universities it is important that students do learn the theory of the subject in order to gain a basic knowledge in this sector. Unfortunately they do not experience a lot of the practical site. Apprenticeships are on a volunteer basis at most universities and most students use their free time off in the semester holidays to have fun instead of working for companies and doing traineeships. However, in the time after having finished university it is of great importance that students can show their future employees that they do know more than the pure theory. In daily working life it is necessary that one is able to work independently and furthermore is able to combine facts,own ideas and concepts. Most people leaving school think it is easy to study at university as they only have to learn facts which are provided by the professor. But nevertheless studying at university is more. Only people who show the ability to think and work independently are those who are highly skilled and later on qualified and contribute to the success and progress of the economy. Furthermore if students are able to combine their knowledge they are also able to think subject linked that means that they are not just specialised in one subject or theme but are also able to link topics with each other. These students are capable of surviving in real life and might have a good career in business.","In conclusion, it can be said that I am off the opinion that it is more important that students know how to understand ideas and concepts as it creates an individual person.",1,,,,,,,,
1455975.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is usually said that people should focus on only one specific subject to succeed. However, contrary to this opinion, I strongly believe that people who live in modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects. The reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who has a variety of knowledge. Moreover, if someone focuses only on one specific subject, he or she might be biased without balance. First of all, I strongly believe that people who are living in this period should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others. When it comes to biotechnology, people are eager to think that it has no relationship with philosophy at all. However, when I watched some SF movie, 'Island', I was deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives, so called global projects , which are reasonable and ethical. It is a problem of philosophy. This example shows that these two academic subjects are very similar to each other. Secondly, If someone commits only on only one specific subject, he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balance. This is because I believe that academic areas originated from one subject, which was not divided like now. As society began to be divided and specialized, academic subjects began to be separated too. However, nowadays, there are new tries to combine the separated academic areas for more academic progress. For example, to cure patients, doctors are working with sociologists because the reason that patients suffer from disease comes from not only health problems, but also social problems such as too much stress and environmental pollution.","In sum, without any hesitation, I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects than to specialize in one subject, All in all, academics in one.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"In sum, without any hesitation, I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject.

Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more. Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future. They become more selfish. To sum up, given the reasons above discussion, I agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Because they are educated more selfishly, most of them concerned themselves more than others. In addition, they prefer to the other noticeable things to make their life more exciting and interesting.","Meanwhile, they don't have enough opportunities to get in touch with their communities.",1,,,,,,,,

264742.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices. I have even come across a few parents who give their children the liberty to choose their career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects. In conclusion, I would like to express disagreement with a person who possesses broad knowledge of many academic subjects.","After all if a person is ""jack of all trades, master of none"" he will not be able to work in this competitive world which exists today.",1,,,,,,,,

1513527.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies.

1200782.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Since I've been a student for a long time, I can say that at the age when we are young students (for example High school age), we normally tend to care more about understanding ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts. Anyhow, I have to say that, at least as far as my experience is concerned, along the student's age we change our learing process, passing from giving more importance to theory to linking theory to facts. For example when we talk about students until high school, I believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools, family and social environment. At this age we don't care, for example, about political events or international affairs. This is due to the fact that certainly we are too young, we are more focused on other things such as having fun, going out, doing some sports. What is more, we're completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts. On the other hand, when we go to university, and this is another step towards being students, I think things change.","It happens because we're getting into another environment in which we ought to be well considered, we're meeting other people with whom we're going to share more adult experience and last but not least we're getting more mature.",1,,,,,,,,

657466.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although there are several advantages to broad knowledge, I prefer to be specialized in one specific subject or area. First of all, I have got the opinion that your chances of getting a job are better when you are specialized. If you have studied business, for instance, with a specialization or main topic like chinese language and its global features, you will become more interesting for a range of special companies. You have the advantage of separating yourself from the mass of other students or applicants. Therefore our chances are better to get a job offer from maybe a chinese company or a company that has got close connections to China. However, if you have just studied business with a wide range of different subjects and areas, it could become more difficult to find the right job. There are no specific positions in a company that would suit you. There is of course no doubt, that education is really important and broad knowledge is always a good basis. But concerning the job market it is probably not enough. Especially today, it is pretty hard and exhausting to find a job in Germany. You have to offer special skills and educations to get the chance of a good job.

You can't expect to manage it within a semester or two. It needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level in a certain field. Some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because of an affection on the spur of the moment, as soon as he realizes that he won't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever, he will just simply drop halfway. Finally, having a determination to specialize in a single subject is a crucial step on your way to self-realization. Anybody who wants to be successful and legendary in his field must have perseverance and expertise. Michael Jordan may be a good example. As soon as he decided to become a professional basketball player, he devoted all his attention to the basketball court, without thinking of other alternatives.","He set his goal and went for it! In conclusion, Specializing in a single subject rather than pursuing many academic subjects will be a wise choice.",1,,,,,,,,
572315.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It's a very interesting topic to write on. Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price. He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price.","Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets success and another takes a regular film which is a flop,who again takes the risk of talking about another variety film, definitely the successful one.",0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Take another example
1558621.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations. I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies.",Why is it happening?

1114825.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"An increasing number of students realize that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts , Unfortunately, there is a growing opposition among the other students , who maintain that learning facts is the most important factor in their studies. However, in the final analysis, I conclude that the former one does make sense. In the following discussion, I would like to present some points to support my statement. In the first place, the key point for my view is that understanding ideas and concepts, undoubtedly, which allow the students to cultivate their ability to self-study, plays the most important role in their studies. Actually, the final aim of the students' studies at university is to promote their sense of independence. For example, in their beginning studies, they need a teacher to guide them. But in their future studies, they must deal with the problems by themselves. Of course, they need to practise their ability to solve the problem when they understand ideas and concepts in class.","In addition, the students can understand ideas and concepts by themselves to check out what they have learnt in the class.",1,,,,,,,,

56222.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In daily life there are a lot of products and some of these are not so good, but most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are! Yes, I agree with this statement because I think that a person has to touch the product he needs because if we follow only the advertisements he can fall into a not good product. For example, if I have to buy some products the first thing is to watch this product and evaluate it because I want to know whether it is good or not. It is like buying a T-shirt of a famous singer or a not famous singer, all the people prefer the first one because they have the name but when they buy it, they do not look at the material (for example), they buy it because it is made by a famous singer. But if we research more and more in another store I think that we can find a better T-shirt for a low cost. Another example is a dish soap that i call'A', the advertisement says that A can clean everything and your dishes will be white like the best white thing.","Then a person goes to buy it because the advertisement says that A does miracles, and when he washes his dishes, he observes that what the advertisement says is not true! Then, in summary I want to say that it is important to think before we do everything especially when we have to choose some product to buy, because sometimes we can take products that most advertisements make much better than they really are and everytime this is a typical thing to spend a lot of money on a product that is not good.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"Then a person goes to buy it because the advertisement says that A does miracles, and when he washes his dishes, he observes that what the advertisement says is not true!

I will show the merits of travelling in a group with a tour guide. First, travelling in a group with a guide can reduce time waste. If we travel without a guide, we may wander so many times because we don't have a lot of knowledge about where is an important place and what we have to see. So a guide can help us to travel around important places. Second, travelling in a group with a guide can reduce money waste. If we travel without a guide, we must pay a lot of money because we don't know how much it is. while travelling with a guide, we don't worry about that. Almost all of the tour guides are already contracted with restaurants, shopping malls and many places. So, we can use all kinds of things in travel inexpensively by giving cheaper money to a guide. Third, we don't worry about danger by traveling in a group with a tour guide. If we travel to a strange place alone or travel with some people, we cannot relax. We may get in trouble with other people because of cultural differences and we may be terrible hurt by strange animals.",So travelling in a group with a guide can reduce our anxiety.,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Therefore, traveling in a group with a guide can reduce our anxiety."
