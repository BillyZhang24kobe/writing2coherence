0,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"To answer this question , i will organize it in two parts. The first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people, and (even if i'm not so old) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than younger  people. We all remember the first time , the first time we made love, the first time we went to highschool, the first time we smoked a cigarette. I think this is one of the reasons we might say younger people can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders, just because everything they do is known. Teenage years are the period where you have lots of experiences, it's an adventure, you discover all the time. I remember my teenage years. It was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i've experienced during this period. i was always going to partys, when i was 15 me and my friend would go to a night club and everything had an important impact on me because it was known.","[""To answer this question , i will organize it in two parts.

1,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding.","[""I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

2,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Personally speaking, I don't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide.

If we do everything in the trips followed by someone,it just looks like working as usual. when I take a trip by myself or with my friends ,we can go everywhere we want,we can eat everything we like. We talk and laugh loudly,and we enjoy myself.","[""Personally speaking, I don't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide.

3,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People usually think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. But I do not agree with  that. In my opinion older people enjoy life more than youngpeople. Firstly, today, people in the world are more and more. As a young man, they will find a lot of challenges, that means older people can not think. I am a young person, I was born in China, there are too many people. I was a student , I left school in july. In my university, there are one million people. Today, we are friends, but when we leave school, we will fight each other. Secondly, young people should have their own house. But it is too expensive to buy for young people, who leave school just now. Parents stayed at home, although the government would give them some money each month, it was not enough. Yong people must give their parents money to help them. But a young man will have his child also. Thirdly, young people have a lot of friends, some of them are classmates at school, some of them are new friends when they work. They will have some partty, it is a lunge spending. I am a worker now, I will gain 2500 RMB pre-month, which includes all of mine. Give some money to my parents, a part to the house owner, a part to the phone, some to spend on friendship.

4,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject. In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree. Anyway now I am a military officer and preparing to enter into post graduate school for public policy majors. I could say this route is paved way. If I had been diligent in learning many academic things when I was in high school, I could have found the right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself nowadays. Lastly, specializing early may make one be partial. As balanced nutrition is very important for toddlers, balanced learning for young people.","[""In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject.

5,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although both young and older people can live a fascinating life, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people. This may be because young people have wonderful dreams about life, they are healthier, and finally, they have less responsibilities. Having dreams and aims is one of the most important things that make young people more enjoyable in life. Young people have many goals that they want to achieve, for example they want to achieve good education, a high position. Also, they dream of a wonderful wife/husband and a happy life, and they make their best efforts to achieve these dreams. Expecting and anticipation of a better future is a main source of happiness. Some, may argue that older people also have dreams and goals, but ,in my opinion, they face and experience real life which may be hard and disappointing. Another factor is, health is very important to enjoy life. When you are in good health, you can do any thing. You can make any effort you want, any kind of sport, any activity. Illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy. When you are ill, you should take care of your health; you should not do any hard activity, any excessive exertion, and can only do some kinds of sports.","['Although both young and older people can live a fascinating life, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church.","[""I agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

8,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"These days, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. yes i agree with this. because the main point is they have no interest in helping others. some young people are giving enough time to help their communities. because they are interested in that. but these days young people are interested in going to the cinema whereas to help others. they are spending more time and more money on the enjoyable entertainment. but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends have enough time to help my communities. we spend time doing that when we are free. So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society. The main idea is that we help the community,by seeing our younger friends or any one,they may try to help the community. so that this will be increased by seeing one another. Finally, it supports the community. the help for the community is the main idea of me. because now adays no one is preffering to help others. because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a little bit of selfishness. so that they cant help the community. the young people now a days prefer to enjoy themselves rather than to help the community. if young people help the community the community will become good. the helping nature of the people should grow from childhood only. because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also. if it does not grow it is impossible to help at a young age. the young people these days are very joyous people. so that they cant help the other people. young people nowadays do not help enough for the communities. because the work pressure on them is very high,and some young students have no time to help the communities because of their studies. these are the main reasons why young people are helping or not helping in the communities. Some young people may help by words not by money. i think the words are very helpful for the development of the community. so young people should help their communities when they have time. if every younger person does this the community will become good. and it is useful for future community development.

I can ask the question that I can't answer , and everytime, he responds tomy question. Therefore, I respect him because he is intelligent.

14,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"We can see many successful people in the word such as BILL GHATES and EINSTINE. BILL GHATES made a lot of money from creating a software called windows and EINSTINE made a great theory such as E=mc2. Even the way they succeed is different the common thing is that they gave their entire life to buildingit. In my opinion successful people don't try new things but try to develop the things they can do well. BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old. At that time there were two famous companies called MACANTOSHI & APPLE(well later they united though).

15,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"60% of people who work do not have time for entertainment because of their work. They can not do anything about this. So I think young people will enjoy life more because they have a lot of free time, they are healthier and they and they usually do not have children. The young people have a lot of free time, and their life will not be affected if they waste it. When I was in high school I usually did not study that much, and I always drove cars with my friends. I only study before those tests, and I usually get good grades. When we look at the health of a young man, it will be much better than an old one.","['60% of people who work do not have time for entertainment because of their work.

18,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yes i agree with the concept of discussing that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Because by understanding the idea only a student can make decisions correctly. By understanding the concepts he or she can judge easily and can get through it. Most of the students understand the idea so that they can do things better and get a grip on that particular idea and also they can learn more things about the idea they learnt. For example a student preparing for his exams is coming over in a few days, to get rid of that he must read properly so that he does not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need to mug up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam. Understanding the idea and concepts the student can learn the facts. For example listening to the lecture in the professors' class there we need more concentration in the class, such that the student must understand the concept and perform well in the exam or in the seminar etc. By understanding the ideas and concepts he can perform them very perfectly. Ideas like in the software field we must learn and understand the concepts to perform well in our interviews, and also in the running project. There is only one way to learn the concept and implement it wherever it is used most in our lives. As mentioned above, the many students mug up the concepts and fail in the exams so the only solution to this is to understand the concepts and implement the faces. Most students will face the problem the reason is that they will not understand the problem and cause them to get into trouble , so this is mainly applicable forstudents.

26,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think to be successful you don't need to do different things but to do things differently. Success and what are the essential ingredients which make a situation or a person successful? In simple terms, success is achieving goals with maximising efficiency. To set a goal for himself and envision the future is what successful men do differently. In life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of those decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally. How much a person is ready to take risks will determine how committed he is to his goals. Coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endeavour. I want to give an example of Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani who established the Reliance empire in less than a lifetime. He started his career in a gas station as a fuelman in some distant middle eastern country. He decided to quit his job there and come back to India and use Stock exchange to new heights. He has to his credit making the stock market familiar to the common man. The stock market did exist before his advent but the common man was quite aloof from it. He gained most of his financial strength from people's money. He also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business. He was the most politically savvy businessman of his time which others never thought of using.","[""I think to be successful you don't need to do different things but to do things differently.

I told her it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she can't even figure out. So she asked me what she should do so I told her to ask her classmates and ask them what they had answered. But she said no to that and said she is the smartest in the class and all the people are not very intelligent as she is so she can not take a risk. That response was beyond my expectations of what she would say. My personal thought was to ask a friend or two so she got a feeling of how she should answer the question but since she thinks she knows what to do better than the others, she did not want to take a risk of getting the answer wrong. In a way, I think since it's just a homework assignment, she can just ask people around her.","[""I disagree with the statement that successful people do not try new things and they use their previous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task.

It is said that "" God will help them those who help themselves "" , it is implied that they take the risk and try out new things which may lead to great success. For example if Edison had not tried for a new thin he would not have invented the electric bulb. If Newton had eaten the apple, he would not have known the law of gravity. Always it is better to take calculated risks when ever required which helps us to flourish in life. When risk is taken the reward is sure some day. It is suggested that you try a new thing ,experiment which leads to development and growth in the field you are interested in. Aim for stars atleast you can seeeach moon. A good example for successful people is Gandhi, the father of the nation of india ,he tried a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took as much risk as he could , Finally he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land. Thats why the risk is always rewarded which is for a good cause for the maximum benefitof mankind. Most scientists are innovative thinkers they like to do things differently with a calculated risk and end up in getting great scientific inventions. People will be successful if they try out differently and take risks, if people take active participation in welfare for the country there will be a great development in the country and this will give confidence to people and the economic status of the country will improve. try for new things for your and human bene.","['I agree with the author\'s statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"".

30,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The issue at hand is whether or not young people give enough time to helping their communities. This is an important topic because it relates to community development. In my opinion young people help their communities in many ways which certainly consumes their time. A main reason for this view is that young people often come out to help their communities in times of disaster. For example if an earthquake hits a particular area then youn ones come out in that area to collect the money from all over the world. They advertise it in the paper, on the internet, on TV and everywhere else possible. Not only that, young people earn their salary to help their community. To organise and collect money for such noble causes, it certainly demands time. Thus, young people are giving their valuable time to help their community. Another reason for my point of view is that young people devote a lot of time to research and for carrying out innovations. For example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young people right from the day of their childhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly.","['The issue at hand is whether or not young people give enough time to helping their communities.

They advertise it in the paper, on the internet, on TV and everywhere else possible. Not only that, young people earn their salary to help their community. To organise and collect money for such noble causes, it certainly demands time. Thus, young people are giving their valuable time to help their community. Another reason for my point of view is that young people devote a lot of time to research and for carrying out innovations.', 'For example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young people right from the day of their childhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
31,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People have a lot of time and energy to do things when they are young. Whatever they do, young people have many more chances to do better than older people. Young people have a lot more possibilities to do enjoyable things. First of all, there are good chances of success doing things when people are young. People who succeeded in their lives usually had busy and tiring but enjoyable lives ; they were motivated and ready enough to do what they were supposed to and wanted to do. Most people who fail in their lives usually regret that they did not use their time efficiently to have enough time to enjoy themselves. Therefore, It is proved from the general lives of people that young people have chances to enjoy their lives. Also, everyone knows that they can do a lot of things when they are young. One day, when my father and I were talking, my father said that he thinks I am lucky because I can do a lot of things which my father can not do now. Most old people have a busy life, so they usually do not have enough time to enjoy their lives doing what they want to do like music and sports.","['People have a lot of time and energy to do things when they are young.

32,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I strongly agree that people who try new things and take risks will easily succeed in their business of life. The reasons are trying new things can find something different than other people easily, taking risks without worrying about what will happen next will usually help you make a brave decision that others are afraid to make, and people usually like staying with the person who has new things. First, trying new things is always an idea to find a different way. For example, the person who manages their business likes to have new, surprise, and unique ideas. At this point, the person is easily successful in his or her business. In addition, people always like to have different things on their day of life. Second, taking risks is a big deal for those people who just want to have adventures everyday. Sometimes, people can learn more experience through taking risks than people who don't take them. On the other hand, if people who don't take risks, how can they occur or improve the way they live. Third, people really like to stay with the risky person or lead by them.","[""I strongly agree that people who try new things and take risks will easily succeed in their business of life.

The first factor that is also an important factor would be health. Many people who are old may face many health related problems that an average adult may not face. So, because adults are stronger than older people health wise, they are more likely to enjoy life. Younger people can participate in various activities that older people may not do. For example, adults can enjoy travelling to various places and like to do various activities like: skiing, hiking a mountain, surfing in the ocean etc, which older people can probably not do. Adults are likely to party more than older people, because they do not have the health restrictions. But, there might be exceptions where people enjoy partying there in later years. Older people can also enjoy their life teaching younger people their experiences from their before years. But, younger people enjoy daily situations more than older people. For example, younger people can enjoy university life by means of learning, participating in sports or in extra -curricular activities. These things are not done by older people though they did these things before, they do not enjoy those things at their older age.","['Yes, young people enjoy life more than older people.

For example, If you understand your major by using the concepts and ideas of the major, you will understand how machines work because you understand the ideas of the machine. You will have more details about the machine. Students should understand ideas and concepts to learn the facts with more details. Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts.

When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strict schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone. As to me, my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it. Suppose, I plan to visit a historical place, which is relevant to my subject, and even most people do not know it, I may have to go there alone. On the contrary, if my destination is Yellow Stone park, I would like to join a group, so I can communicate with other members. In addition, money is another factor, which can affect my decision.

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who like sports. Even though one does not like sport, he can still talk about sports topics with other people. Because he knows the knowledge of sports, he can create good friendships by communicating easily. Moreover, learning every knowledge might help people to discover their other skills. For example, a doctor always works everyday.

45,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I think its true that most young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy their life more than some old people in an age of 70 bi 75. young people have all their power and don't have to think about their health anddeath. old people have not so much patience and some are really frightened about their death, so they live with thoughts all around their death and so they are not so happy as young people. But if someone is old but still has enough power to do sports and if he will be happy too. When a person has a religion and believes in a life after death, it would help him or her a lot not to think always about death.

46,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being makes it easy to succeed in their common life. First, usually successful people attract more successful people. For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends. That is, this meeting provides them with the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and these kinds of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove themselves and normally, they are going to win, the people tell us that they are lucky people. It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance. Second, two important motors of human beings' behaviour are motivation and emotion. These people are really motivated to get new experiences, learnings and knowledge. And even, this behaviour makes them pleasure by increasing some chemical substances in their brain. For example, taking new risks, such as changing the location of living, taking a new job and meeting new colleagues are really activities that pleasure them.","[""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

He got to sacrifice many of his pleasures for the sake of his duties. On the other hand most young guys' main aim would be to enjoy life whether its college or work, as they get someone who cares aboutthem. Second, not all things are possible for an older guy as he doesnot have the energy or capability. Energy is innate in a younger one.

60,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other. Trying new things adds to our lives numerous new concepts. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After for a while, I was bored playing soccer. I want to change something in my life style. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it, I learnt several new rules about sport, so it encourages me to play it. The other example is about risky. I took a PhD in education for two years in my country.

It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius.","['Shaping of the human thinking style is possible.

63,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide. When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do. But any group in this situation would be disappointed. Finally, there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone, you are not alone. It means that going on a trip alone allows you to make friends. For instance, I went to Japan when I was a freshman at university. I had been travelling for a month. I could not speak Japanese fluently on that tour, I could make friends - Nakasaki, Murama, and Yorisimo. It was an unforgettable experience. When you are with your fellows, you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends. As I mentioned above, I don't like traveling in a group led by a. guide. Fixed tour planning makes me exhausted.

Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities, but it's not very often. I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time on their communities is the school rules. In high school and college they have a kind of rule -like homework- that a student has to help his or her community at list 10 hoursper year. We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. The second reason is that commissars are in need of helpers. They have a lot of things to do so they need many people. Most communities do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people. As long as there are no young people who want to help the communities, communities leave work undond and this is happening a lot.","[""Helping our community is very important.

So, for every successful mission to take place a risk has to be involved. all the leading business companies in the world take a major risk when they invest in a new project. the new projects may or may not do well and the company might run into losses. but most successful people are ready to take this risk and most of them are successful in their plans. over the years the risk factor has been taken into consideration by all leading men and they take the risk into account even before they take up a business. but its annoying to know that these people who are mostly successful when they have taken the risk or taken a chance have been successful otherwise today we wouldnt be connected to the entire world through the internet if the risk was not taken. we wouldn't have been doing so much with the computer if bill gates hadn't taken the risk and invested so much in only developing computers and its software. people who are successful in share markets are prone to huge risks and losses but all the leading men in share companies take risks and are successful also. all the world leaders are also subjected to the risk of their lives but they dont step back from their posts.

69,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons. First, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. For example, in 1995 when I was junior at Tokyo University in Tokyo Japan, I studied law and tax. One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law. One of my friends, Tanaka, is the best student studying economics and has a lot of knowledge of the bank system. He helped me. I was able to learn a lot of things about bank law. As the example shows, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. Second, having a variety of academic subjects is more fun. For example, in 1996 when I worked part-time at a private school, I taught Japanese History. I taught Japanese History ,Law and Tax in the historical class. Children in my class were interested in social systems. They asked me a lot of questions about history, law and tax. Some children wanted to study law. I had a good time at my lecture. This experience clearly shows that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes me fun and brings me a good time.","['I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons.

72,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I strongly agree that people who try new things and take risks will easily succeed in their business of life. The reasons are trying new things can find something different than other people easily, taking risks without worrying about what will happen next will usually help you make a brave decision that others are afraid to make, and people usually like staying with the person who has new things. First, trying new things is always an idea to find a different way. For example, the person who manages their business likes to have new, surprise, and unique ideas. At this point, the person is easily successful in his or her business. In addition, people always like to have different things on their day of life. Second, taking risks is a big deal for those people who just want to have adventures everyday. Sometimes, people can learn more experience through taking risks than people who don't take them.

The reasons are trying new things can find something different than other people easily, taking risks without worrying about what will happen next will usually help you make a brave decision that others are afraid to make, and people usually like staying with the person who has new things. First, trying new things is always an idea to find a different way. For example, the person who manages their business likes to have new, surprise, and unique ideas. At this point, the person is easily successful in his or her business. In addition, people always like to have different things on their day of life. Second, taking risks is a big deal for those people who just want to have adventures everyday. Sometimes, people can learn more experience through taking risks than people who don't take them.

Some of them believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I am hesitant to agree with the statement, and the reasons are listed below. Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them. Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather. And I am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being, cars will become more popular. Admittedly, Many people think that the number of cars will be decreasing, because they cause a great deal of pollution, and people nowadays pay special attention to the environment. Nevertheless, I deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finally varnished, with the development of techniques. And we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by the UN, that a car made with the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before. In conclusion, though the cars face the problem that they pollute a great deal today, I think the number will not be fewer, because more and more people can afford them, and such great comfort and convenience they offer, and, the most important.","['The speed of development concerned technique is so fast today, and more and more speculate about what will happen in 20 years.

In our parents' period, it was really different, everyone helped everybody. Today this period is revolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon. First, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60's or 70's. Young people always pretext they don't have time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old,we, young people, always have the feeling that we are too busy. We have personal work, group projects, sports etc but in our planning, there is no time for anything else. Well, I say that but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we would prefer going 3 weeks on holiday rather than staying one week to help a charitable cause. There should be another reason why young people are careless. Secondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individual and egoist society. Everyone thinks about him or herself. Young people believe less in God than before, that could also be a good reason. There are not a lot of religious events. But religion is an efficient way to get people around a good cause in order to help other communities. And all of it is just the consequence of the environment of a society or a lack of values, education. Nowadays parents do not teach their children to share.

Nowadays young people enjoy themselves well compared to in the old days. Because at this present time they have so many entertaining equipments and these all are not available in the olden days. And the world is developing rapidly. At a time, young people also worked hard to achieve their goals and to realise their ambitions. They are doing hardwork and enjoy it at a time. They separate their time for working and for enjoying themselves. Now these days so many young people are working for many great companies and corporate companies,then they all work weekly for five days for company and the remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family. So young people also do hardwork but they make some schedule and follow that. Now so many young people are working for some company or worked for some institute,But these companies and institutes are built by old people. So old people work in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run those institutes and companies. From the above two sentences i can say that old people work harder than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels. And these days also have some young managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists,But they all get that companies and that industry from their parents and they run those companies verywell. Suppose Anil Abani is a great industrialist and great managing director for Reliance companies. But he gets them from his father and he also works hard and develops their companies and develops their shares in the present market.

First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work.

If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business.

80,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"". In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation.","['I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class.

95,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students can learn about many things in school. When students learn new things, It is very important for students to know what they are learning from classes. And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts. I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from text books. To understand the basic idea is not simply but, in my opinion, it can expand the student's abilities of thinking and creation. Understanding new ideas and concepts can take a long time and sometimes it could take a few decades for students. It can be a problem learning new things. That's why some instructors and students take shortcuts to learn new things. For example, when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio, so called 'Golden ratio' which is believed to be the perfect proportion for every object. It is a very difficult theory to understand for freshmen and it could take more than 2years, but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory. Even though it is difficult to understand the ideas, students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it. It can be easy to create new things with the basic concepts. For instance, a musician who understands the principles of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and rhythms using the basic music element. Consequently, I recommend understanding the main ideas when students learn new things. Even though it is a hard and difficult way to learn about new things, after understanding the notion from the basics.","[""Students can learn about many things in school.

100,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide. When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry.

When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry.

101,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with this. It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts. It is a more difficult thing than learning facts. First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts isn't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think most of the kids don't know which of these. Do you know why? Most parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of things. And that makes children interested. Second, the facts and concepts are more specific things. All adults think, they are difficult for children so children don't have to know about that. That is not true. The truth is the adults don't know about the facts and concepts. That's why they say about that. They don't know so the children don't have to know. I think that's kind of stupid. And the adults scared of the kids will learn that something they didn't know.

One of the many reasons is that people try new things in their lives because they are looking at how to be altruist and how to be successful. For instance, if I want to be a competitive person sending cars, I need to have many ideas in order to create new models and new types, more strongs, more sures, cheaper and nicer. I have to try many risks during the elaboration of these cars, I have to risk a lot of money on employers that they be more prepared and I must give them all the necessary resources that the government's law requires.

When students know the concepts because they understood them, they won't forget them. By understanding the ideas and concepts, the students have the capacity and the ability to explain to others what they know and the area that they dominate. Also, students that understand topics, have more chances of getting good grades in tests, because they can give more facts and an example of what they understood in class. That is why it is so important for teachers to explain with examples and to give facts and make good points, so that the students can understand the area that they are studying completely. Teachers should ask questions to see if all the class comprehended the point that they were trying to emphasise. When students understand the ideas and concepts they will have better results in their exams as well as presentation, reports and other evaluations. Also they will have the capacity to help others that don't understand the area. For students is also important to learn facts because before they understand the concepts and ideas they have to learn the facts of the subject. By learning the facts they learn the reasons why something happened, where something happened, why something happened and who made it happen. Facts are also really important, and teachers teach the facts so that the students learn them and understand them.

107,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"well, in my opinion it is important for students to learn the facts, rather than understanding the ideas and concepts. because in my view the facts of any situation or the subject itself are more important. the facts form the real basics of that particular situation or topic. and facts are more understanding and believable than having some kind of an idea or knowing the concept of the topic. for example if the student is working on a project related to the subject he is studying ,then it is always better for him to understand and learn the facts of that particular subject than just getting an idea about it. by learning the facts he could always produce more information or real work. If the project is about a topic in science. Like the importance of nutrition in a human body. Then it is better that the student understands the real facts of the importance of nutrition in humans and then he can create some ideas while doing some research on this topic and finally come to a conclusion and understand the concept of the topic itself. furthermore,I would say that if the student has only some ideas about the importance of nutrition in a human body then he will not present a good and complete picture of the topic. thereby giving a superficial idea of the topic.

108,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In an aspect of shot time,It seems more effective to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize how much information or how many facts we learned and knew. However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others. There are two aspects to all the information we face everyday. One is the fact that we can see easily. It is like a penonmenon in nature. We can believe what we can see. The other is the concept that we can see only when we study it and we understand it. If people understand a certain information, it means that people know how the information is formed, what the information and how they can apply it to others. It is good for students because they must have interest in the information when they can understand it totally and apply it to others. It can make students keep studying and learning. Lastly, understanding ideas is less boring than learning fats. Students do not like to learn something without certain reasons. They are not interested in learning hard and difficult facts. Therefore, we make them understand something to learn. Understanding is different from learning. It can give students a motive to learn and make them feel funny.

113,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Do you have more pleasure when you were a kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious. We will see that being young provides less responsibility, more time and places to socialize and better health to enjoy life. The biggest difference between older and younger people is that the young ones have fewer sorrows. Children and teenagers don't have to worry about money, their parents do. They also don't need to worry about cleaning the house, buying food, it is also their parents' job. The lack of responsibility enables us to focus on other things in life: having fun. School is not only a place to study, it is also the best place to make friends. Courses and breaks are special opportunities to discover new people and socialize with them. During all the studies, a student will meet more people than he can ever in his grown up, office life. Old people also have other concerns. As we say in France: ""If young people knew if old people could. "". Health and physical condition are not the same for everybody. For older people is more difficult to practise sports and dance in nightclubs and old night long.","['Do you have more pleasure when you were a kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious.

Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly.","[""There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue.

115,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies.

Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities.

I definitely agree with the statement that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject for three reasons. first, it provides us with a broad and comprehensive point of view. in reality, there are many problems that cannot be solved by one point view. for example, you can refer to the environmental problems or poverty and so on. the environmental problems are related to chemistry, economics, or politics. poverty is also connected with many points of view such as sociology, economics, agriculture and so on. there is no problem that can be solved with only one point of view. you have to integrate your broad knowledge to find the solution. second, it can give the students choices about which field they want to study and have a career in. it is stupid to force students to choose their field without knowing many subjects and which field suits them. especially in japan, students must choose their discipline before they enter the universities. therefore, i was frustrated doing it, and chose my current program at my university which allows you to study whatever you want while you are an undergraduate student. so i really appreciate this program. like this program, studying many things can give students a chance to choose. lastly, it brings you a lot of fun studying many things. people naturally have curiosity to know many things and it should not be stopped. when i learn something new, i feel really happy and want to know more. for these reasons, i believe that to study many more academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.","['this question reminds me of the time i chose my way when i was a high school student.

126,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements are a good way to sell products. In fact, they can make products look much better than they really are. Therefore, they can make them look different sizes and more beautiful. First, tricking customers' eyes is a really good way to get more money. First, you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it look the desired to people. For example, I remember a TV show that was unbelievable to win a sports car if anyone answered the question shown on the screen. However, the question was so easy that I was going to call them. I saw alot of people calling them; in fact, the TV show got alot of money from the people calling it. A person won the sports car, finally, and he was so happy. However, the funny thing is that the car was a really small car. Actually, it was a kid's car toy. Therefore, they showed the car, and everyone thought that it was a real car with a real engine, but that tricked everybody even me. I think that this is a smart way of marketing products. Second, advertisements make the products look more nice and beautiful. In fact, they use professional and careful workers who can handle the product without making any mistakes that let the people notice any disadvantages of it. For instance, i saw a knife advertisement. The knife seemed so sharp. that was just because of the careful workers. however, when i tried the knife in my home i broke it. In brief, advertisements make changes to the product size and make it more useful.

127,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Since students start learning things in schools, they have the responsibility of learning everything they should know; therefore, students are supposed to understand ideas and concepts more than just knowing the facts. There are some reasons why I think students should know ideas and concepts but not just the facts. First of all, students that understand ideas and concepts can learn better and easily get interested in that subject. For example, once students understand the ideas of how math works, they can do the math more easily and faster than others who don't understand the idea. Also, if students know what the concept is in a history event, they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it. They can actually learn much better than students who do not know what the concept is. Secondly, I don't believe students would learn well if they just learnt the facts. For instance, many subjects like history, geography and even science need students to understand their ideas and concepts. If students do not learn the ideas and concepts they will not be able to get good marks in the subjects. Further more, if students do not learn the subjects well, they can easily fail the courses and lose their interests in them either in the history, math, science, and even English classes. Based on the two reasons that I mentioned above, I suggest that understanding ideas and concepts does a lot more important than only knowing the facts and it does not matter in any of the subjects.","[""Since students start learning things in schools, they have the responsibility of learning everything they should know; therefore, students are supposed to understand ideas and concepts more than just knowing the facts. There are some reasons why I think students should know ideas and concepts but not just the facts. First of all, students that understand ideas and concepts can learn better and easily get interested in that subject. For example, once students understand the ideas of how math works, they can do the math more easily and faster than others who don't understand the idea. Also, if students know what the concept is in a history event, they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it. They can actually learn much better than students who do not know what the concept is. Secondly, I don't believe students would learn well if they just learnt the facts. For instance, many subjects like history, geography and even science need students to understand their ideas and concepts. If students do not learn the ideas and concepts they will not be able to get good marks in the subjects. Further more, if students do not learn the subjects well, they can easily fail the courses and lose their interests in them either in the history, math, science, and even English classes."", 'Based on the two reasons that I mentioned above, I suggest that understanding ideas and concepts does a lot more important than only knowing the facts and it does not matter in any of the subjects.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal.

Therefore he has no challenge, because he has done this several times and knows what to do. Without the challenge he can not show success and willn't be recognized by anyone. The second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful. Everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular, new or difficult. In order to do new and difficult things, I need to know my capabilities. These capabilities will need training. Hence if I do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities, I have less possibilities to choose from. Therefore I am limited in the things I can solve. In contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which lead to beingmore successful. The third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful. For example your boss will test you before he promotes you. He will give you things to do that are new to you. For that you will have to take risks to solve these problems. Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful.

143,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Indeed , advertising is one of the best ways to reach people. But some advertisements seem the most time much better than they really are. In my opinion, i agree with this statement for these two reasons:the use of very good commercials and also the use of celebrities in the commercial. First of all , many advertisements have really good commercials which can convince people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of those commercials which want to sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as they get this product they might looklike this person. For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight. Secondly, there is a huge use of celebrities in the advertisements that gives a false image of what a product really is. For instance , the last campaign of Proactiv Solution which is supposed to help to relieve acne. Personally, i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress.","['Indeed , advertising is one of the best ways to reach people.

The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help.

Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities?

Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body. They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool. And so do their friends. Concluding my essay I would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even 'most' as is written in the statement.

159,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The numbers of cars of different big cities are very high today, especially in some rich countries,for example ,USA,the number is incredible---------every person at least has one car in their home. The abundant numbers actually create a lot of problems for their city and the world. All these problems will finally force us to use fewer cars. Therefore,I agree there will be fewer cars in twenty years' time. The traffic problem is actually the most important reason for the increase in the number of cars.

163,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross. However, the outside looking is easier to do compared with design inside. Therefore, most of the time the products seem much better than they really are. Third, people usually care about the inside quality after they buy it. The thing for people to decide whether to buy or not is usually outside looking. So people will complain about the products when they buy them.","[""Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products.

164,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","My opinion is that, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, in twenty years' time. I will explain these with three supporting reasons. First of all, new transport can be created. Our life is rapidly improving by technology development. There will be a car which flies in the sky, or intermediate moving vehicles from one place to another in one second. This new technology makes people not use a car because it will require less energy to operate and it will be more convenient, and faster than today's car. Secondly, People use public transport rather than their own cars. every year, the number of people who use public transport such as buses, trains and subway is increasing. According to the statistics, the reason why they take public transport is it takes less money, less time and is convenient. If they have their own car, it costs a lot of money to fill petrol, parking fees, taxes, car insurance and fixing the car. As well as this, the cost of petrol is rapidly increasing. Also, there are terrible traffic jams every morning. This is a reason why people use public transport rather than their own car. This will make fewer cars than today in the future. Lastly, people are thinking about the environment. Everybody knows that cars pollute the air.

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat.

181,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is now very common in our cities.

Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group. However, I personally prefer that when I go in a group, it must be led by the tour guide. Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups. They make some funny statements, and sometimes jokes. Sometimes, the information is real but it is conveyed in a group such a way that everybody laughs. For example, I went to visit a museum, i. e Tajmahal in India. This tajmahal is built by the Sahjaha in love of the wife. Everytime our tour guide asked us what our husband would make for us in future. He said to the man that he would not build this kind of monument which means you donot like your wife.

In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands.

190,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I can not agree with the statement which is that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I actually think the statement is the opposite, which is that older people have enjoyed life more than young people have in recent years. In my country, Japan, there are many young people who do not do anything; they are staying at home and they do not go to school, do not go to work, or do not do part-time jobs ; they do not want to do anything, or they do not know what they want to do. Now the kind of youth has been increasing, which is a social problem in Japan. This problem is symbolized by young people not enjoying their life. They get confused about their life. They do not know how they can enjoy their life, because they do not have many experiences and they cannot find or understand what things they are really interested in; but they are staying in their home. Thus, they do not try to enjoy their life. In the meantime, older people know how to enjoy their life because they have many experiences to find what things they are most interested in. And many older people have worked for a long time in some office or in their home as housewives. So, they want to use the time for themselves this time. They know how to use the time moreover, they have desired if they quit jobs, they want to go hiking or traveling, spend their time doing their hobbies. They try to use the free time as they want, which is that they enjoy their life. There are two big differences between young people and older people.

192,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place. Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there. They may lose their way, and be in trouble with the particular language and culture. For example, American children who go to Singapore receive a heavy punishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place. If a tourist was along with them and taught them Singapore's rules, they wouldn't be in trouble there.","['As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide.

193,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I neither agree, nor disagree with that statement. I think actually both are important. Let me give a personal story that helped me to draw a conclusion to this question. The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of facts -knowledge and who in fact do not read the newspapers"". Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact do not exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view. For example the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was often called a big actor, a pretender.

I think actually both are important. Let me give a personal story that helped me to draw a conclusion to this question. The problem is, if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideological basis of the facts he knows about, he will probably always have a big problem convincing anyone else for a project or an idea. The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of facts -knowledge and who in fact do not read the newspapers"". Both cases are nothing to follow after. But, to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence, both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact do not exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view.

On the contrary, a person not trying new things and taking risks can not prospect and see different fields and also he or she may be embarrassed or surprised by these circumstances because of no experience. In fact, only a few people having experience of new things and risk can be possible to know the skill,like ""how to do this dangerous position"" ,""how to manage some risk"" as ""the statistics of the management ability in the dangerous environment. ""Actually, lots of successful people know this fact and they try new things in their various places or conditions. Second, people should learn and experience time to time because the environment has changed and is rapidly developing as technology.

A few years ago, when our country was in a difficult situation, everyone had the consciousness to do something for his/her country, but now we only think about what we can do to save ourselves. One of the causes of this problem is the consciousness that is given to young people in their home, by their parents. The most important place where a person learns most of the things that he/she will use during his/her life is his/her home. In the older times, parents were more careful about this situation, but as time passed, as the problems of the parents increased about their children, giving community consciousness is not anymore an important problem for the family. Another place, that where young people are educated is school. At school, the teachers are the people who are responsible for teaching the importance of the community and helping these children. Teachers should give the conscious, explain the good ways of helping the community and describe the positive things that they will gain by helping the community to the students.

215,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks. The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal, he wants to have something new and more difficult to do. Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succeeded in something, he will always want more. Alpinists, for example, don't usually stop climbing after they manage to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other mountain , harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conqueror, didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finally defeated. And I think because he was successful for the first time, he couldn't get rid of his willpower. An other reason would be the fact that successful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships. Well, he is now looking forward to becoming a Formula one driver. Because he wants something new.","[""In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks.

216,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price. To conclude, because of inaccurate estimations and damaging by the price of products, we seem to buy products which are actually not as good as they expected. Therefore, we should be aware of what we want, and what we need. We should think twice that advertisements are not as good as we think.","[""I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above. For this reason, more and more people will buy cars on their own. Secondly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is an example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow. Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there was no transportation to there in the past. So with the demands of the families, there will be more cars on the roads in the future.

Practice is necessary in fields such as the Sciences. To make a theory, you have to practice first. A basic example will be the gravity discovery by Newton: when an apple fell on his head. All experiences bring to a conclusion which is the theory. But before arriving at the theory, scientists have to define the problem, make a hypothesis, practice, find a solution and draw a hypothesis. Nowadays, in science classes such as chemistry, physics, or biology, students have to follow the same pattern: problem, hypothesis, practice and solution which lead to the theory. Thus the theory is the result ofpractice. For education and everyday life, it is very important. It represents a basis, a fundamental part of understanding a topic.

Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail. One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"".

I joined this club one year ago and at first I was surprised how many young people were offering their help there. All of these people are graduate students who use their free time after being in their courses and classes to spend it teaching other students. A major fact is that the other guys and I do not earn a lot of money by this activity. Since my first visit to the club I have been doing private lessons once a week. And I think it is a great honor to see the person taught by you getting better and better grades. I also have a friend who supports a poor family in Asia with 400 Euros a month.

246,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts. Therefore the amount of money is a very important aspect of human life. Everybody has different points of views about how they must earn the money. Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger. Burger King advertisements are the most popular examples for the curious consumers to find out about their consumer rights. Last but not least, being the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the price of your product. For instance Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market. So they are able to change the price of their products, Ipod, freely. How did they become the main producer? With advertisements actually. They presumed their product would survive for 2 years, but after ten months it was almost broken down.","['Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts.

In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them.

271,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is very important for students, and also for other people to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learn facts without knowing what they are. There are three main reasons why it is important. They can remember ideas easily and also last longer, able to get interested in subjects, and increase their self confidence. Firstly, by understanding some ideas, it is much easier to memories and it also lasts longer than just learning without any understanding. Especially for students, they have to prepare for a unit test or provincial exam which is after the whole semester. They need to know the facts properly and remember them in the right way. To give an example of this, during students' studies, they will find unconvinced time if they do not understand the facts that they learned. But if they understand everything, they are able to remember longer and have confidence to prepare for the test. Secondly, if a person understands an idea, it is possible to get interested in it. Because it is the only hard time before he/she understands. After they know what it is, then it becomes a very interesting idea which can get the person very interested in it. For example, if a student does not understand how to multiply, a teacher will teach the student. After the person knows how to do it, math can become a very interesting subject. Lastly, self confidence is really important forstudents. By understanding ideas and concepts about some subjects, they enjoy the time to study which makes them know more and more. This makes the students increase their self confidence. For instance, if a student does not know anything about history, but finally he/she understands, the person thinks of himself as a very smart person, so the student can teach or tutor other friends who do not know about history.

Therefore, understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts, so that will remain in students' brains for much longer."", 'Third, ideas are much more appealing than facts when they have some other problems.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
295,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing. Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives.","[""It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age.

297,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion i agree with the idea of understanding the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts and this is because in order for a student to apply what he has seen in class to real work, it is better to understand the concepts and ideas so he can convert them to the best for the work. Some of the reasons are that first if a student can understand and imagine he will be able to apply what he just noticed (learned) in another way or situation, like when a ""painting student"" just learned that the colors could be mixed to form some others new colors, and the professor explained so well which types of tones can be mixed with others, and he will experiment with all that he understands of this class. But on the other hand, if the student had learnt the fact that colors can be mixed, like red with blue give the result of purple, we identify that the person will have the idea and absolutely the knowledge of every color, but he didn't understand the real meaning of the objective of the class. The second reason is that, since every person can transform the information in different ways and for some people it can be easy to understand new subjects in the class, like the ""history of Mexico"" all the concepts, what happened in the past, but definitely understand it, get the main idea with their own words, will be able to remember it in the future. And in contrast a person who learned the ""HISTORY"", is not a very good resource for teaching some other classmates, because it is closed to explaining with their own words what they learn, as an example Its me, i can not remember the History completely , due to a memorizing moment in order to learn by that time.","['In my opinion i agree with the idea of understanding the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts and this is because in order for a student to apply what he has seen in class to real work, it is better to understand the concepts and ideas so he can convert them to the best for the work.

Studying facts has its advantages for students. For example, students can study a lot of things within a short time. Studying formulas is the best example. If we study how to solve problems by certain formulas, we could solve many problems especially Maths. However, I strongly agree with the statement. There are more advantages to studying concepts for students. The best example, which illustrate my point of view is studying science. When I was a child, my parents encouraged me to have curiousities. They made me think about why the rainbow is colourful and why the shapes of the moon are different, and so on. Then I tried to figure out the structure and elements of them by myself. Sometimes I went to the library to research and asked professional people. From this process, I trained my ability to solve problems. This is really important study for children.

299,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,Over the last fifty decades education has been a significant role in people's lives. Because of that they have research into lots of subjects or just one. Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other people think that the better one is to specialize in one specific subject. First of all having a knowledge of many subjects does not mean having lots of essential things. People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use them together. Because those are different things. But when people are taking some research into similar subjects it can help them with lots of things. Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas. Because of that people can prefer this way. Secondly specializing in one specific subject can be more acceptable to everyone. When people are interested in one subject they can continue with this material and they can be a professor. And also if a person knows everything about a subject they also have learned some different things. People who have a knowledge of a specific subject have a more successful life than others who have none. So they earn more money than others do. To sum up i agree with the idea which was mentioned because of the facilities of board knowledge. Knowing lots of things can get a number of opportunities which can help us in our social or daily life. But both many academic subjects and one specific subject are essential for people.

300,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ideas and concepts came from the facts. I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims. According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense.

However, from my own point of view and experience I prefer having a broad knowledge of different subjects , because this is translated into a person who is able to face different topics in a discussion or debate. First of all, I would like to explain my choice by arguing that in the future I would like to work in a business in which to do dynamic work.

The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help.

Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world.

So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people. As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people worked for a living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of their lives. Young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is a very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself. Sometimes, he looks like a working robot. I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working has become his routine life. My father has worked hard for the living and he can't stop working even though he is rich enough. I think my father is similar to any older people. The goal of life is different for young people and older people. So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. I can't say which generation is happier than the other generation because everyone has different conceptions of happiness. It doesn't matter how people live but it is important to enjoy their own lives. People should have their own happiness and do their best to achieve happiness.","[""I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

The carbon dioxide in the engine gas makes the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth. And then the water level rises and covers the available land of us. Maybe we will lose our whole earth to live on. If cars don't decrease, there will be a crisis of the entire human race. Moreover, the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now, and in about 40 years, there will be no oil to depend on.

And in my view, I most like to agree with the statement. I know it is irrational to make a point without understanding, so I'll get help from my own experience. Last summer holiday, some friends with me went travelling to the beautiful coastal city of Dalian, which locates in the north of China. The reputation of Dalian is very good in China, and surely we are all delighted about the chance of travelling to the beautiful city. But things do not always go on as we wished. As strangers, we are excited about its fantastic landscape while arriving in Dalian. For the sake of saving money, we didn't hire a guide, and we thought a map could handle it. The coming things prove that we are absolutely wrong. Soon after the excitement, the sunset came, and we faced the problem of accommodation. The summer is the best season for touring in Dalian, thus all the rooms are reserved. Finally, we only asked for help from a taxi driver, and eventually he sent us to a hotel in Busan, which locates far from the city center. In the following days, we are all depressed, as a result of not having a tour guide, we just spent most of our time from one place to another one though the transportation in Dalian is not terrible.

331,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Many people in the world try to enjoy their life. However some people think older people can not enjoy life, but that is just a stereotype. Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do, such as knitting, watching movies, planting their own gardens. Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to the flowershop and looked for the special flower seeds. And when he got back home, he sprayed the water on the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it. The second reason is that not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots offriends. In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the trip was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend time with their friends and enjoy the time with them. Forthose reasons, old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. In particular my grandfather and grand mother, they really love their life. If someone says old people live their life just boring and nothing special, that is not true, they can live their life what they like to do and spend the time they want.

In order to explain this topic, we can show that this is a controversial point, depending on which condition you look at this situation. First of all, it's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing very quickly, and there are more and more cars on the road. This certainly leads to the increasing of the price of the train and the price of tickets in this last ten years. But, you can tell, that in the industry are trying to change this problem, not by trying to reduce the car industry, but by trying to find a new way not to pollutethe planet, like by biocarburant. Furthermore, It's nearly impossible to avoid people using their car, like for working people, or people living far away. And in addition, today, having a car, is also to be part of the social world, to be autonomous. However, You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear. When you see the fast evolution of all the other ways to be driven. Furthermore, lots of people prefer public transport as a cheaper way to go to work, and governments understand this and are developing this, like in hong kong, where you can do everything without anycar, or in London, where the city doesn't allowany car. Or even in strasbourg where the french government make cheaper tickets in order to encourage people to let their car at home. In addition, we can not plan clearly in which way the world will evolve. If you take as an example a developed country, because it's the one who will be more affected by this matter, you can already tell how they already try to develop other ways to move in and outside of their country. Take as an example, the train development and the decrease in the price in some companies helped by government. In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of cars on the road in twenty years, in my opinion, I can say I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road, this due to the evolution of the population. But with the news technologies, the bad effects of this on the environment and as a bigger scale on the planet, can be reduced, which is a good point, and as a matter of fact that the petrol resources in the world became really rare, which can be a real turn in the car industry, I hope in a good way.","[""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the battle started, what the conditions were after the battle finished, and so on. It could be in your brain longer than learning facts. Understanding concepts could be valuable when you are studying a different topic. For example, the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict. On the other hand, if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even, maybe you have to study again for your business or your geography class. Students could develop better skills if they learn concepts and ideas. They could argue for example, why the battle happened, or even learn that war conflict is not the best way to thrive.

342,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than old people do for many reasons. A young person can do a lot of things because he is physically healthy, can do a lot that old people can not do and because he is young and no one will look at what he is doing. A lot of people think that old people enjoy life more than young people because they think they have experience in life. They think that this experience will make them happy because they have no idea what to do to be a happy person. This may not be a good idea because even if old people have experience they will not be able to use this experience. They become old and harmful. They will not be able to do every thing.

If you learn the facts without an accurate concept, you may hear you are smart at first. But eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of facts will collapse. Second, I think you should experience the proper process. Everything has an order in process. Understanding concepts is a start. So you can't understand further facts without them. If you skip something , you will meet trouble in the end. Speaking again, If you ignore the process of understanding accurately, you will find you didn't even know an easy thing. Third, you should understand the academic thing as a whole. All the stories and facts link together. You should understand something through another thing.

First, I think they can succeed because they have already taken their risk, it is all risk out side the world, each thing has a risk but seems to big or small. For example, if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be an accident on you. Taking risks is a must. The mean of success is they know how to do things well, A human being has a tendency to learn more to find out new things. Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve. Successful people know that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up with them. They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what the world needs so they can do it. Although many people think successful people are selfish, just doing things they like or they want, they won't share with others, but I think it is only other people who don't understand what they are thinking.","[""In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

362,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"According to my life experience, i agree with the statement that young people do not pay enough attention to their communities. In my opinion, there are countless factors for this phonemphone. I will explain some of them in the following paragraphs. First of all, nowadays the job market is more and more competitive. As a result, the performance in school has become more and more important. However the experience of helping communities will not be recorded in their grade. Meanwhile, Parents expect their children to focus on their studies. Students are not encouraged to help others. Children spend lots of time learning english, painting and music. Furthermore, people are becoming more isolated with each other. In the past, the neighbourhood was familiar with each other. They may organize a small group to clean the street.","['According to my life experience, i agree with the statement that young people do not pay enough attention to their communities.

363,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Since I've been a student for a long time, I can say that at the age when we are young students (for example High school age), we normally tend to care more about understanding ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts. Anyhow, I have to say that, at least as far as my experience is concerned, along the student's age we change our learing process, passing from giving more importance to theory to linking theory to facts. For example when we talk about students until high school, I believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools, family and social environment. At this age we don't care, for example, about political events or international affairs. This is due to the fact that certainly we are too young, we are more focused on other things such as having fun, going out, doing some sports. What is more, we're completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts. On the other hand, when we go to university, and this is another step towards being students, I think things change. It happens because we're getting into another environment in which we ought to be well considered, we're meeting other people with whom we're going to share more adult experience and last but not least we're getting more mature. As a result we can link in a more efficient way what we studied ( also during high school) to the real facts. For example it happens to me when I study the concept of inflation. When I was watching the TV news, I was really surprised to finally understand what inflation is and what its effects are. And this is not all.","[""Since I've been a student for a long time, I can say that at the age when we are young students (for example High school age), we normally tend to care more about understanding ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts.

365,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes for most people. When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strict schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone. As to me, my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it. Suppose, I plan to visit a historical place, which is relevant to my subject, and even most people do not know it, I may have to go there alone. On the contrary, if my destination is Yellow Stone park, I would like to join a group, so I can communicate with other members. In addition, money is another factor, which can affect my decision.

In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think.

In deed,I support the view that specialization is a good thing. So, people know what they are talking about. In some fields, like men who built houses, specialization is necessary : how could someone as good at painting as a wood table? Furthermore, it implies a longer study if you want to have broad knowledge. Moreover, if someone has broad knowledge, I think it is impossible that he knows accurately all his many academic subjects he has even learned. This is a great problem, there are not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity. You need to be very smart, like Leonard from Vinci. He is a good example. Nevertheless, in contrast to my first explanation, it is important too, to have people who know a little bit about everything. Important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referants between specialists. And because of their knowledge, they will be able to resolve problems and manage a team. That's why they have a great adaptability. To conclude with this statement, i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists. They both complain about themselves.

Moreover, if someone has broad knowledge, I think it is impossible that he knows accurately all his many academic subjects he has even learned. This is a great problem, there are not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity. You need to be very smart, like Leonard from Vinci. He is a good example. Nevertheless, in contrast to my first explanation, it is important too, to have people who know a little bit about everything. Important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referants between specialists. And because of their knowledge, they will be able to resolve problems and manage a team. That\'s why they have a great adaptability. To conclude with this statement, i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists. They both complain about themselves.', ""But like specialized doctors in aesthetic for example, couldn't ze imagine more people who could have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and after that more specialized in one subject ?.""]","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

Nowadays, there are trends not having any cars, encouraging the use of public transportation, and the attempts to invent more effective transportation. It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jams, environmental pollution and a lack of oil. First of all, one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jams on our roads are incredibly severe now. In some countries like Korea, the land is very densely populated, there are excessive cars on the road, there are traffic jams even on the highway. Not only for Korea, it is a worldwide problem. Many countries are suffering from traffic jams. The government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jams. And one other problem as serious as the above is the environmental thing. Cars cause pollution in many ways, most seriously, the engine gas of cars makes the sky foggy and dirty. It causes contagious eye diseases, and respiratory problems. In addition, it promotes global warming which is making mankind very afraid. The carbon dioxide in the engine gas makes the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth. And then the water level rises and covers the available land of us.","['There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years from now, surely.

Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so. As the most modern buildings are a mixture of music and painting. A specialist is the man who soeciallyizes in more than one subject. The famous English detectives in the novels are good at detective and music. Such examples can be seen in every day life.","['It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not.

Nowadays, governments are doing their best to limit the number of cars, scientists are trying their best to invent new kinds of traffic tools and the public have begun to know the importance of protecting the environment. Therefore I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years. First, governments should ask for higher taxes for buying cars, and this will make fewer people have the eagerness to have a car. Providing more public transport tools is necessary for governments as well. In addition, convenient traffic lines and fine road conditions are also important elements. Imagine that one can get his goal place quickly and conveniently by a kind of public traffic tool, who else would like to have his own car with a high price of oil and high tax? Scientists have something to do as well, however, they are trying hard now. In the next 20 years, scientists are supposed to invent more kinds of traffic tools. Now in Shanghai China, we have Cixuanfu rail train which has strong power and is produced with sophisticated technique.

On the other hand ,let us see how success comes from new things. For example,white brothers invented aeroplanes as they were new to the world they were praised by the world. And later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplanes are not so much praised as the white brothers. This is because the basis and the idea is given by the white British and the others have just made some modifications. Those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extent that the white brothers got. the people who follow the procedure given by others may not get success as much as the people who give the basic idea. we should note that going for new things gives success but it may or may not be changing the field of interest. In the software field they need to change their domain frequently to give their best outputs. So here they need to try new things and take risks.

408,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I think that this statement is a real view of today's life of young people and not only. Because the first reason for this problem is that today , young people have not too much time to spend with their real friends and so don't have time to help their communities. Today these boys always have the same size of work at home for the school assignment , but when this is finished , they start to play with the computer or to do something similar. In this situation they have only a little time to try to help a community , but in this time they think about other things. These communities , i think that may be helped by everybody , also in daily life but with today's life , with only the money at the center of everything , only a few people there are that think about them. Now , infact , there is changing in the life not only of young people , daily work is different also for the time that it has in a day , with a lot of people working from the early morning to the start of evening , so they may try to help the communities only at the weekend if they don't work.","[""I think that this statement is a real view of today's life of young people and not only.

410,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view it is right. Being more successful is important for successful people and they used to choose this way. It is a paradox but it is also a law of nature. But some people only do that.","[""People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know.

Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You should not be concerned about whether you have enough money either if you have a job or not. It does not matter to you. On the other hand it really depends on how people have planned theirlives.

First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product.

How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product.

First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good.

416,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In this topic, some students prefer learning facts, others believe understanding ideas and concepts is better. Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts. It is hard to catch the main ideas, students may only be interested in the stories, but didn't know the meaning. It can't happen when you focus on the ideas or the concepts. Because the concepts and ideas are the standard for whole stories. In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content of this course.

It is still not general for the students. Finally, the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course.

417,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least. Because it has too many things you need to do for it, and sometimes it has some telegraph gap which is hard to cross.","[""Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products.

423,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work.","['I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact.

424,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life, in several supports and in several ways. To wonder if advertisements make products seem better than they really are could be seen as a nonsense question, because precisely the aim of an ad is to make a product unacceptable. That is why I agree with this statement. Advertisements are made to give people the will to buy the product. It's also the only way to get people aware of a new product, and obviously the better this product is, the more people will buy it, even if it's just to try. So my first point is that advertisements should and must make the product better than they really are, because they're made for that. My second point is that advertisements can do more than just showing a product at it's best. I mean that advertising is also a way to build an image, a spirit for a product and for the people who buy this product. For example, in advertisements for cars, advertisers manage to show only what they want to insist on, in order to attract a specific range of customers. They can insist on security, fun, sport, but it's always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving. So advertisements are a way for producers to sell their products by giving more to the consumers than only the product. Obviously all people are sensitive to the same propositionsof advertising, and that's a way to highlight the weakness of advertising. An ad can't be liked by everybody, and sometimes can't be understood by anybody.","[""Advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life, in several supports and in several ways.

Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession. Another reason ,I believe that taking risks and trying new things brings success because it brings creativity in a person which leads to success in life. When we try new things in life then our brain works faster and we feel more challenging. Anil Ambani is the biggest example. He had a creative mind who always tried to do something new and take risks.","[""When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment.

442,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although there are several advantages to broad knowledge, I prefer to be specialized in one specific subject or area. First of all, I have got the opinion that your chances of getting a job are better when you are specialized. If you have studied business, for instance, with a specialization or main topic like chinese language and its global features, you will become more interesting for a range of special companies. You have the advantage of separating yourself from the mass of other students or applicants. Therefore our chances are better to get a job offer from maybe a chinese company or a company that has got close connections to China. However, if you have just studied business with a wide range of different subjects and areas, it could become more difficult to find the right job. There are no specific positions in a company that would suit you. There is of course no doubt, that education is really important and broad knowledge is always a good basis.","['Although there are several advantages to broad knowledge, I prefer to be specialized in one specific subject or area.

443,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ideas and concepts came from the facts. I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city.","['The ideas and concepts came from the facts.

I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place.","['As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide.

As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are. Thirdly, for many factories and supermarkets or sales, maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements. Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheating advertisements can perfect products. There are not products but music, beautiful scenery in them, Of course, not all advertisements are deceitful. many advertisements are good as well as their products.","['When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

However I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons. First of all, generally speaking, young people are less careful of their health than old people are. As people grow older the possibility that they will become sick willincrease. In hospital there are too many older people who consult a doctor for many reasons. As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the dearest thing of all. Secondly, young people do not have their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan for the future easily.

They do not look for people, who need help. I think, that young people should be asked or even forced, if they do not want to help other people.

As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them. In this fast growing society, cars do play a major significant role, as they do be very helpful for quicker transportation, because time once lost cannot be regained, and for the world twenty years from now, time will play a very prominent role. There are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars, which would become a major resource for growing the usage of cars in the future. By using this type of car, they have many advantages like the faster mode of transportation, which not only improves one's only status but improves the whole economic development of the country.

In addition its really very hard for any citizen to wait for government mass transportation , who is in an emergency, or planning to go for a picnic with his family members or so and would be more suitable to have his own car than rely on any others.

Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities?

Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try.

In this test , you don't know what the test looks like ,because you didn't take the test before. Hence, you will meet lots of difficulties in this test which you didn't predict ahead of time. And several good opportunities are given , and you have to overcome them one by one. Since that, you will know what you will do next time. That can be helpful for being successful. Secondly, knowledge can be an aid to anyone who can help you to be successful. But first of all, how can we get knowledge? The answer is simple, taking risks. In any kindergarten of risks, you must learn some skills to survive. In this process, your knowledge is gained and you are more approachable to success. If you do what you already know how to do, then you will lose the interest in the thing that you are doing. So you won't put many affords on that subject.

It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way.

466,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities. However, I disagree with the statement because there are a lot of ways to help other people and we can't estimate how young adults help. To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities. For example, one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor. However, she actually did her best to provide help through the Internet. Since she took a variety of classes at her school, she couldn't spend time just during the day. After knowing this fact, most people felt sorry for her and regretted focusing on just the quantity of the feasible time. In addition, helping others is not able to be observed, it also can't be estimated by an objective standard. Of course, spending time would be a good basis, but it never shows one's all trying as I mentioned before. To give an idea, here is an example from Kim-Jun, who is one of the famous lawyers in Korea. He is renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedication to society. It is evident that he has limited time to do multiple things at the same time. In order to overcome these problems, he has devoted himself to the community in various ways which don't need to take a long time. He provided huge amounts of money for poor people and no one blames him although he doesn't spend enough time. In brief, I strongly support that young people still do their best for the world. They have their own ways to help others and we never evaluate their trying.","[""Many people believe that young people today tend to spend less time helping their communities.

Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fights between them. So, there is no unity in this world why would young people change this by helping who and with which means? Modern life makes young people very narcissistic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be useful. Some will help the oldest and disabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them. Others will come into an association to create a better life place for their community. Indeed some associations and organisations have social aims in which young people want to be involved. In my case, I really want to represent the Black in France because there is a lack of representation even in the media, fashion, intellectual and scientist work.

481,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years.

The second reason is that there are lots of things that allow old people to do but not for young people. generally old people have more time and money than young people have. young people have to study if they are still in school. and they get certain money from their parents so they do not really have lots of money to go out all the time. for example, my mom and dad love to travel to other countries with their friends and they do have money to afford it.

I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities. We know that it could be important even for our own future, but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away. we try to keep every thought, every occasion, every second that is going away. and we are not able to stop and think about so important things. We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world. because change happens. but the problem is: will it be better? we don't know. but we will think that we were happy when we were young. because we lived every moment with an excessive intensity! i want to demonstrate what i meant to say. there are about eighty words left. if i had wanted to think i could have written a lot of other things. but now i'm thinking that i'm tired and my lovely friend is downstairs.

If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses. He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job. He can make more effort to learn those things. Because he has to enter that field to work. then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts. Another example, imagine a successful state player of any game, he succeeded in his team with the state players. Then he tried to get a chance in the national team.

It is better to have a specialization in one specific subject if it involves your work. An airline pilot or a doctor cannot just have an idea about how their work is supposed to be. They must exactly know how to contact the control tower or how to execute a lombar injection. A teacher that cannot resolve a student's doubt can never be an effective one. All people should have a complete and exhausting knowledge of the specific subject or job they depend on. Surely if this does not happen, people will be damaged by it. On the other hand, having a general culture is useful in everyday life. Knowing basic things about politics and political candidates will make you able to exercise one of man's biggest freedoms: the right to vote. Simple math knowledge will help you with filling out tax declaration papers. A high school biology course clears every doubt that Egyptians, Greeks and Romans haven't been able to explain in ages; people with broad knowledge are advantaged in understanding and communicating with the rest of the world. Just like every other thing knowledge has to be a combination, a balance between specific and broad. Specific knowledge helps you in your work and the people that benefit from it.

It saves you time and you don't have to get stressed about planning a trip.

While you are planning your trip, you already earn so many things and experience. Second, if you are with the group, you have no choice but what to eat.

If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics call I will use the concepts and ideas to get to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts there will be times when they will not help get the solution. In our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very basic example, If my parents want me to go buy vegetables from the vegetable market I will decide which way will be the easier road. I will answer by asking myself using my concepts and not going with the facts. Our human mind can take only some facts and then we have to use the concepts to work towards success.

508,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this opinion. I think, in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. I have some reason to think about that. First, some companies are now inventing new cars, like hybrid cars, electric cars something like that. Actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes. We are also interested in cars that are good for the environment. The car industry will change their way of selling the car to customers. Of course, I think of the customer for the environment of the earth will change in this few years. Second, I think that physical translation is not convenient in countryside.

510,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays due to the fact of a changing economic situation which asks for highly skilled and qualified people and makes it even more difficult to get a suitable job, it is more important for students to gain the ability to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is to learn facts in order to be special on the job market. At universities it is important that students do learn the theory of the subject in order to gain a basic knowledge in this sector. Unfortunately they do not experience a lot of the practical site. Apprenticeships are on a volunteer basis at most universities and most students use their free time off in the semester holidays to have fun instead of working for companies and doing traineeships. However, in the time after having finished university it is of great importance that students can show their future employees that they do know more than the pure theory. In daily working life it is necessary that one is able to work independently and furthermore is able to combine facts,own ideas and concepts. Most people leaving school think it is easy to study at university as they only have to learn facts which are provided by the professor. But nevertheless studying at university is more. Only people who show the ability to think and work independently are those who are highly skilled and later on qualified and contribute to the success and progress of the economy. Furthermore if students are able to combine their knowledge they are also able to think subject linked that means that they are not just specialised in one subject or theme but are also able to link topics with each other. These students are capable of surviving in real life and might have a good career in business. In conclusion, it can be said that I am off the opinion that it is more important that students know how to understand ideas and concepts as it creates an individual person. All the other students who only learn facts store these in a short term memory and do not know how to think independently. This kind of learning does not represent an appropriate basic intelligence and education.

Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there.","[""It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age.

Secondly, young people should have their own house. But it is too expensive to buy for young people, who leave school just now. Parents stayed at home, although the government would give them some money each month, it was not enough. Yong people must give their parents money to help them. But a young man will have his child also. Thirdly, young people have a lot of friends, some of them are classmates at school, some of them are new friends when they work. They will have some partty, it is a lunge spending. I am a worker now, I will gain 2500 RMB pre-month, which includes all of mine.

526,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge. There are three reasons why I think that. First of all , It will be very boring to study one subject for a long time. In fact , you might get totally exhausted and you might even lose interest in that subject. For example, students who are good at calculation study math for a long time and would also like to change the studying subject to a subject that can be read without using your hands or brain. Secondly, you can know what you are really interested in when you study a bit of various subjects. This is the reason why education doesn' t focus on a specific subject and it can also make up the choice of what we really like about a student after a long time of basic education till high school. For example, we decide what major we want to study after entering universities. We can decide by the interests we developed since we started elementary school.

In my opinion, I believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge. There are three reasons why I think that. First of all , It will be very boring to study one subject for a long time. In fact , you might get totally exhausted and you might even lose interest in that subject. For example, students who are good at calculation study math for a long time and would also like to change the studying subject to a subject that can be read without using your hands or brain. Secondly, you can know what you are really interested in when you study a bit of various subjects.

527,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"While we are studying it is good to know what I should learn. Should I keep working on a subject that I already master or should I develop a wildspread culture ? On the one hand, I could specialize in order to become one of the best at what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another subject, while on the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill. A lot of scientific development wouldn't have happened if scientists just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improved the way he viewed physics, he wouldn't have been able to develop his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics. Usually great intellectuals have a broad knowledge that gives them a new way of seeing their specific subject. So in many ways both assertions are complementary. Personally I am a very curious person. For me all knowledge is good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity. Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I can only understand. For this reason I believe that it is ""better"" to have broad knowledge. It is more social. However our social environment and our society enhance experts. If you want to be hired by a company, whatever you are doing, you need to be good at it. That is the reason why school and university are providing students with very precise knowledge. You can easily find courses in the development economy or in french Middle-Age literature. Our culture is driven by experience.","['While we are studying it is good to know what I should learn.

528,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to try to reach good lifestyle standards therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things. Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrast, some think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well. I actually agree with the first idea. these are my following reasons Firstly,success is related toresponsibility. When successful people try new things and take risks they trust their responsible characteristics. For example i know a professor who is so successful at his job. Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to them. In addition to this he never leaves his jobs because ofluck. He usually plans his works and lives for them. Actually this feature brings success to him In addition to this,success is reletead withexperience. If a person has experiences in life or business or human psychology he/she can achieve success very easily. Also these experiences help the person to try new things and take risks in a comfortable way. Plus the person can feel relief depending on the experiences. for instance i have a friend who is so willing to travel and see the world. Moreover she has many kinds of experiences all over the world. Basically these experiences help her in her job to be more successful. She is not afraid of trying new things thanks to her experiences. If people do not live the experiences they can not know the things which they face. The last but not least success is related to knowledge. Knowledge enables people not to hesitate to try new things and take risks. Furthermore people can get the risk more easily because of the fact that they can get a variety of information about what they will do. Next people can feel more self confidence with the knowledge that they have. They do not think about what to do for a long time. All in all as i said before success is related to both responsibility and experience as well asknowledge. These valuable things make people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The long and the short of it is that there is an old saying that change brings life.","['Mankind always needs to try to reach good lifestyle standards therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of human life.

To let the students understand ideas and concepts is a requirement,but to let the students learn facts is more important. Second,how does students understand ideas and concepts better than learn facts? For instance, we read a novel story,we know what it talks about,but sometimes we might mistakenly know what we have learnt about. On the other hand,if you have learnt facts. then it is easier for you to understand ideas and concepts more clearly. For students' studies,the main point is to learn facts no matter what kind of subjects. it is proved that it is always true. So, if you want to learn fast? learn facts! it will help you a lot.

There are two reasons why I believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. First, if students don't know about the facts perfectly and only understand about its circumstances and ideas, they will not know what the truth is. This would make students confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood the concepts of. They could do well according to what they have understood about, but if it is wrong what they have understood, they will fail at the moment. The second reason why i believe learning facts is more important is the change of concepts and ideas about what they learned. The concepts and ideas about an objective could change as time goes on. In other words, even though they learned the right concepts and ideas when they were students, the concepts of an object can keep changing depending on the social environment, so what they know will not come true anymore. Third, understanding only concepts and ideas is less effective for making creative for the student. If they understood the object's ideas already, they would believe that there is only the ideas for the object.","[""In my opinion, it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand the ideas and concepts.

533,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits.

Travel with a group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensive. Usually for group travel , one will take care of the ticketbooking, hotel reservation etc. The group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay.

In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for the next day's events. This is so time saving.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well.

What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that.

Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view it is right.

World War II was the most cruel war that humankind has ever suffered as a result of millions of victims in both parts. Beyond these atrocities there were awful ideas about how to rule the world. Furthermore, I can see the reasons for bringing a country to the war as the United States did to that war. The US could see people having their natural rights which are inherited from human beings such as freedom or religion. These are ideas. Second, we use ideas and concepts not only to find out facts, but also to learn about our future problems and facts.

It is a fact that oil prices are higher than ever before. Also, pollution shows a lot of economic and environmental problems and it is enough a reason to stop using cars because of their lack of usefulness in the cities. Oil prices are a principal problem for western countries which haven't their own oil supplies. For example in europe, it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes, insurance and enormous fuel costs. Also the cost of space in major cities makes the price rise. One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe, e. g. the government in Vienna is making cycling routes in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its inhabitants. Holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car. A city designer in London said that cars shouldn't design the city. He meant that cities are not made for cars but for humans. This statement has its truth, when one compares cities in newer countries with older ones. European cities have a natural structure. The old parts mostly the centers aren't designed for cars but more for humans. American cities like Caracas have major problems with mobility of humans.

For example in europe, it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes, insurance and enormous fuel costs. Also the cost of space in major cities makes the price rise. One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe, e. g. the government in Vienna is making cycling routes in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its inhabitants. Holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car. A city designer in London said that cars shouldn't design the city. He meant that cities are not made for cars but for humans. This statement has its truth, when one compares cities in newer countries with older ones. European cities have a natural structure. The old parts mostly the centers aren't designed for cars but more for humans.

Providing more public transport tools is necessary for governments as well. In addition, convenient traffic lines and fine road conditions are also important elements.

In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree. Anyway now I am a military officer and preparing to enter into post graduate school for public policy majors. I could say this route is paved way. If I had been diligent in learning many academic things when I was in high school, I could have found the right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself nowadays. Lastly, specializing early may make one be partial. As balanced nutrition is very important for toddlers, balanced learning for young people. If one goes into a specific thing too early, of course she knows very much about her subject but not about other things. It can make her concentrate more on the specific, neglect more on all the rest.","[""In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject.

First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better.

The light came out soon after the invention of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or relation. As a result, successful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one. This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going, but stay behind. However, I dont want to overstate the advantage of my agreement, since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some scientific cases. Firstly, when people try to invent new things, it takes a long time to achieve the achievement.

The very purpose of that advertisement is lost now a days, they are just showcasing the product , then it originally exhibits its characteristics , comparing it with other products and fooling the public of the worth of the product, then really it has. They use some girls , for advertising face creams, before they use this product they look not beautiful, but using the products for a few times brings change. It seems, they will be looking charming, how does this happen, its just the camera trick and the make up they are given , if we use it orginally will we get that change, no definetlty no For example take an product, namely toothpaste, the companies related to it are pepsodent, colgate, closeup, all this product have same ingredients and mixtures of same level , but while advertising each company showcases its own product , differently, comparing with others , not mentioning name of the differnt company, that their companies product has better features than others, u just tell me how the product desingned with same formula , but with companies different have different features.

I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices.

A young person generally knows that he or she has an undeformed body related to most of the olders and finds himself or herself strong enough to perform a different job. For example they can play football whenever they want but the olds can not. Youngers can also try new and dangerous sports which make them feel excited. Younger people know that their age is an advantage to be in a good manner. Being a young person I know I have a bigger chance to live more than the elderly and that sometimes motivates  me.

656,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be young is beautiful. If you were a child, you could do what you like without problems.","['In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion.

657,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"The answer to this statement depends on personal life experience and different cultural background. Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. However, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone rather than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conspicuous aspects as follows. The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guides lead you to and have no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get access to the local people' s life and culture. Through talking and living with them, you can have different cultures and perspectives on life. That will only present you with a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world. there is another reason deserving some words here. Travelling in a group led by a tutor is a waste of money in some conditions. Because the guide depends on the money you spend on the trip to survive. They usually convince the traveller things that have no value become necessities and buy them. In contrast , if a person travels along a person can use a computer to get information about an unknown place.","[""The answer to this statement depends on personal life experience and different cultural background.

If you spend all your time on a specific subject, you can improve a lot rather than the person who spends his or her time on two subjects. This is because he or she should divide the time.

Compared with A person, B person would know more about politics. However, A person would know more about economics than a B person. Secondly, in the sense that broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be useful for normal lives. However, you would lose the competition with others who specialize in a particular subject. A firm is a group of all the specialized people in their people.

662,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"TAKING RISKS Most people are afraid to take risks in their lives. They prefer to live in safety. That's why they do not want to change their conditions. But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves. There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some people think that they are only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. Through these experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his internship. He worked as a worker in a building. During his internship, he experienced and learnt how he could build a strong building. Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well. Good productions bring success. For these people should know how to do and improve it.","[""TAKING RISKS Most people are afraid to take risks in their lives. They prefer to live in safety.

In my grandfather's case, he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even huge things when he was 21 years old. Moreover, he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured himself when he was in junior high-school. I guess he was a tough boy, but he never plays sports now. Furthermore, he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster and play some sports when you are 70 years old. Secondly, I claim that young people can fall in love with their classmates, school friends and so on easily. In my case, I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student. It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me. However, older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think. It is because older people have their husbands or wives in many cases. Of course, if you are young and not married, you can have a boyfriend or girlfriend freely. While it may be true that not every young person can fall in love with someone, and older people tend to have more money than young people. However, young people are given freedom.","[""Without questions,I agree with this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do.

Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up!

674,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, we are living in an individualism world. In our parents' period, it was really different, everyone helped everybody. Today this period is revolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon. First, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60's or 70's. Young people always pretext they don't have time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old,we, young people, always have the feeling that we are too busy. We have personal work, group projects, sports etc but in our planning, there is no time for anything else. Well, I say that but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we would prefer going 3 weeks on holiday rather than staying one week to help a charitable cause. There should be another reason why young people are careless. Secondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individual and egoist society. Everyone thinks about him or herself. Young people believe less in God than before, that could also be a good reason. There are not a lot of religious events.","[""Nowadays, we are living in an individualism world.

Some think that doing what they already know how to do well is better, contrary to those who think that trying new things and taking risks is more important to be successful.

For example, some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging, cycling. Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them. However , if people want to enjoy life more and be more healthy , they should try new and risky sports. They shouldn't be afraid of them doing risky sports. In addition to this, taking risks is a fundamental issue because of the experience of life more deeply. For instance, i always do the most difficult tests first at school. Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it. Although it means taking risks, i prefer to do it and anytime i am not in a bad situation. Therefore, it is really beneficial. Last but not least, taking risks is also important to see which we can do the best. For example, a footballer prefers to run not too long in the exercises. While he is doing that he doesn't know if he runs very long distances, after that he can be better athis job. Thats why it is important.

690,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Well i think it ` s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first question is, what are old people, and what are young people? It mainly depends on the person. Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and elderly people are about 60 years old. In this case, young people have other interests than elderly people have. For example, young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music, whereas elderly people are enjoying a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the background. But i have to mention, that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music. For example the generation who grows up with Rolling Stones or AC DC still go to their concerts. The only difference is, that young people are normally in better shape than elderly people are. The older you are the more problems you are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can do more sports. Elderly people have to care more about themselves.","['Well i think it ` s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first question is, what are old people, and what are young people? It mainly depends on the person. Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and elderly people are about 60 years old. In this case, young people have other interests than elderly people have. For example, young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music, whereas elderly people are enjoying a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the background. But i have to mention, that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music. For example the generation who grows up with Rolling Stones or AC DC still go to their concerts. The only difference is, that young people are normally in better shape than elderly people are. The older you are the more problems you are getting with your physical condition. For example, young people can do more sports.', 'Elderly people have to care more about themselves.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
691,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with that statement. In the world, many successful people exist such as Bill Gates, Lee Gun-Hee who is Samsung's CEO. So then if they didn't try new things, can we live like this convenient life now? Of course not. The other example is a soccer player who is Ronaldo. If Ronaldo did not try new skills, could he become a world star and get the love of fans? These questions are based on my opinion that will be explained. Do you know the proverb that ""No pain, No gain""? It is the best sentence for me in my whole life. If Successful people don't want to take risks, it is freedom for them. But they can not get more fame or what they want. For example, Bill Gates became the richest person in the world. Because he makes Windows 95. So did he stop development? No, he is developing now such as Windows XP, Vista. The other example is BMW and Mercedes BENZ. They are the best automobile company in the world.","['I agree with that statement. In the world, many successful people exist such as Bill Gates, Lee Gun-Hee who is Samsung\'s CEO.

I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career.

When a customer looks at this kind of advertisement he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw in the advertisement.

People who make ideas for advertisements always try to find creative and impressive ideas. In my view, it can't be avoided for companies to make products seem much better than they really are in their advertisements. There are so many advertisements in the world and companies want people to be interested in their products. Besides, to make interesting advertisements, they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points. First, most advertisements are made to grab people's eyes. For example, we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on TV. However, they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences. But every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently from others, because they need to grab people's eyes. And it will be connected right away with their selling.

I think that for young people it is very important to understand concepts in a deep way because after graduation they should use what they have learned. So it is good that universities force students to study a lot and do conceptual exams. But many of the people that attend university are not young, and for them i think that the lessons have to be more interactive and with facts. Infact they need to match what they are studying with what they have learned from their experience. For a young student this is not so important because we do not have work experience. I attend the second year of an undergraduate course in Bocconi, a university of economy in milan. During the course often happens that the lesson is boring. The lessons usually take about 2 hours each and it's difficult to keep the concentration during all the time. It will be better if sometimes the lessons contain facts because that helps to hold the concentration and sometimes helps to understand concepts. With this type of lesson students can both learn concepts and facts, and start to understand how the things they are studying are related to the work. In my opinion good universities should prepare you with lots of concepts but also with some real examples to apply what you have learned. Moreover you can change your ideas during your life but before you have to understand that idea.","[""I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts, but with some limitations.

Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details. Therefore the ability to make a comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible. For instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film can only tell one or two sentences.

I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people. As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people worked for a living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of their lives. Young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is a very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself. Sometimes, he looks like a working robot. I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working has become his routine life. My father has worked hard for the living and he can't stop working even though he is rich enough. I think my father is similar to any older people. The goal of life is different for young people and older people. So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do.

In a few years, our world has got so many machines and their' improvements, cars are one of them as well. This helped to people to build up many mechanical things such as cars, buildings, computers or even children's activities. This also affected our relationships and the way we met new people that we never imagined, it did affect the children's world as well. Since those computer games or GameBoy came out, they have stopped going around their houses, stopped running and hanging out with their friends outside of their houses, instead of these things stopping, they started to play inside their houses and stayed in their rooms, did not come out from there and they became much weaker because of these computer games.

In a few years, our world has got so many machines and their\' improvements, cars are one of them as well. This helped to people to build up many mechanical things such as cars, buildings, computers or even children\'s activities. This also affected our relationships and the way we met new people that we never imagined, it did affect the children\'s world as well. Since those computer games or GameBoy came out, they have stopped going around their houses, stopped running and hanging out with their friends outside of their houses, instead of these things stopping, they started to play inside their houses and stayed in their rooms, did not come out from there and they became much weaker because of these computer games. However, because of those technological improvements, people have started to get cars for each person much easier than before. The cost of cars is getting lower and lower, and car companies try to make and sell them as cheaply as possible with lots of benefits. So, I disagree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today but, ""the problems with it"" is we might finish all the oil we have now and we can not use cars in thefuture. However, we are making new style of cars that run on battery, which means they are not going to use oil any more instead of using a battery.', 'It includes the solar battery as well.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts. Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying. while a person can teach something if he does nt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough.","['From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life.

The statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts "" is also a big topic in education. I have studied since I was a child, and I have expenses of many kinds of teaching methods. From my experience, I agree with this idea I think that teachers can not teach everything, education gives us the ability to think. First, Teachers can not teach everything. In school, there are time limitations. It is impossible for students to learn everything in that school. For example, nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years.

In hospitals, nurses need to study nursing in depth in the critical area; nursing methods are changing everyday. Therefore, I think that teachers can not teach every fact in the school; students need to understand ideas and concepts. Lately, education gives us the ability to think: how to deal with a situation, how to solve that problem. If students only understood facts, they could not solve a different situation. However, If students know the concepts or ideas, they could use those concepts to fit the situations. In nursing, nurses care for a lot of kinds of patients: different age, gender, disease, race and culture. If nurses knew the concept of nursing care, they would change their nursing care to fit patients' conditions. If nurses did not understand the idea, they could not provide good nursing care, and patients would not have a good outcome.

Therefore, I think that teachers can not teach every fact in the school; students need to understand ideas and concepts. Lately, education gives us the ability to think: how to deal with a situation, how to solve that problem. If students only understood facts, they could not solve a different situation. However, If students know the concepts or ideas, they could use those concepts to fit the situations. In nursing, nurses care for a lot of kinds of patients: different age, gender, disease, race and culture. If nurses knew the concept of nursing care, they would change their nursing care to fit patients\' conditions. If nurses did not understand the idea, they could not provide good nursing care, and patients would not have a good outcome.', 'I think that facts show people one situation.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
758,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In an aspect of shot time,It seems more effective to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize how much information or how many facts we learned and knew. However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others. There are two aspects to all the information we face everyday.","['In an aspect of shot time,It seems more effective to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize how much information or how many facts we learned and knew.

Older people, in contrast, see the same things often with different eyes. They have much more life experience and another view on many things and I think this is often a more negative view. Older people think about consequences first and are often more worried about what could happen in a negative way instead of how this could be enjoyable for me.

At universities it is important that students do learn the theory of the subject in order to gain a basic knowledge in this sector. Unfortunately they do not experience a lot of the practical site. Apprenticeships are on a volunteer basis at most universities and most students use their free time off in the semester holidays to have fun instead of working for companies and doing traineeships. However, in the time after having finished university it is of great importance that students can show their future employees that they do know more than the pure theory. In daily working life it is necessary that one is able to work independently and furthermore is able to combine facts,own ideas and concepts. Most people leaving school think it is easy to study at university as they only have to learn facts which are provided by the professor. But nevertheless studying at university is more. Only people who show the ability to think and work independently are those who are highly skilled and later on qualified and contribute to the success and progress of the economy. Furthermore if students are able to combine their knowledge they are also able to think subject linked that means that they are not just specialised in one subject or theme but are also able to link topics with each other.

778,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people and old people have different life styles. As far as I am concerned, young people have more methods of enjoying life than old people. In the following paragraphs, I will reason and provide examples to support my opinion. Young people are full of energy, which means that besides their studies and work, they have much more energy to have fun. Young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and havefun. At night, the dancing bars are full of young people. They dance, talk to each other and drink together. During the holidays, young people drive to the mountains or the sea shore to hunt , canoe or hike. Because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work, they cannot spend as much time as young people on holiday travel. They normally stay at home and watch the TV or chat with their old friends. Young people have more new methods to enjoy life because their brains run faster than old people. Because there is a lot of pressure from the job, young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged.","['Young people and old people have different life styles.

779,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Although older people can enjoy life, I definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people can enjoy eating, travelling, and being healthy. First, young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young. For example, when young people want to eat some great dishes, they can eat all of them. They can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot. However, usually, older people cannot eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot. Not only can young people enjoy eating, but they can also enjoy travelling. If the person who is young wanted to go somewhere, the person could go there soon. The person does not need a lot of preparation for the trip. However, if the person who is old wanted to go on a trip, the person would need a lot of time to prepare for the trip. So, young people are very flexible and aggressive. These aspects are very important for young people, however, health is the most important part of young people. Older people suffer from a lot of illnesses.","['Although older people can enjoy life, I definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer.

No doubt, in the present generation the competition has increased and inorder to lead a really good life people really need to work hard. So in running after making a penny people overlook the need to spare time for working for the community. But still its not true that people dont give enough timefor thecommunity.

Then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospitals and getting their treatment done.

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because society is always interested in new products and it is more effective to provide new products faster compared to its competitors. One of the reasons that I agree with the statement is that the customers always aim to have new goods or services. In the recent society that has a large number of goods and services, people tend to be bored with keeping seeing the same products. They always want new or interesting products that are different from the others. Apple, the computer company, is one of the effective examples.

793,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days. But personally I believe that education and society give young people the chance and the time to have contact with communities to help other people. First, the school focuses on the importance of volunteer work in the community these days, so that students give more time to do volunteer work than before. For example, when I was in high school, the teachers set up the volunteer committee which gives the information and chance to do volunteer work in the hospital to clean the rooms. In addition, the school produced an event where students pick up the trash around the school once a week. The experience of attending volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students. That experience gives me the chance to have contact with my community. I was very busy studying, but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities. According to the newspaper, the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer work these days. This example demonstrates that schools make enough opportunities for students to help their communities. Second, the community has a chance for young people to help their communities. For instance, In Tokyo, where I live, the number of robberies and fire accidents caused by people is increasing. Therefore, in my town, the committee of the town decide to ask young people to look around the town to protect them from accidents during the night. I attend this activity once a week. This example also shows that young people have a time to help the community because of their needs to defend themselves. I can understand the opinion that young people are busy studying and eager to play the TV game, so that they seldom help their community.","['Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days.

The experience of attending volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students. That experience gives me the chance to have contact with my community. I was very busy studying, but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities. According to the newspaper, the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer work these days. This example demonstrates that schools make enough opportunities for students to help their communities. Second, the community has a chance for young people to help their communities. For instance, In Tokyo, where I live, the number of robberies and fire accidents caused by people is increasing. Therefore, in my town, the committee of the town decide to ask young people to look around the town to protect them from accidents during the night. I attend this activity once a week. This example also shows that young people have a time to help the community because of their needs to defend themselves.', 'I can understand the opinion that young people are busy studying and eager to play the TV game, so that they seldom help their community.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

Facts are things that are true no matter what and in pretty much every scenario. Although ideas and concepts can vary. Ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete. Concepts can be altered , modified or even proven to be false. A fact would be, what goes up must come down. That is a proven fact. No matter where you are on earth, whatever is launched up into the air does not matter how high, it will eventually come crashing down back to earth due to the gravitational pull. An idea and concept on the other hand would be the evolution from monkey to man. This is just an idea nothing is for certain about this hypothesis or concept. Many people may believe otherwise, that man's kind originated from Adam and Eve and that they both lived in the garden of Eden. Although one may be more believable than the other they are just ideas and different concepts made up of different people whom may have influencedothers. That is another problem with ideas, they can be forced upon a person. It is not like a fact which is impossible to prove false. Therefore, you have no choice but to believe it.

When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not.

810,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try. Once you begin with one subject ,you will be surprised at what it looks like and try to find out more about it. For example, you are having a toefl test. In this test , you don't know what the test looks like ,because you didn't take the test before. Hence, you will meet lots of difficulties in this test which you didn't predict ahead of time. And several good opportunities are given , and you have to overcome them one by one.","[""i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

How ever, successful people innovate new things to develop the country more effectively,because they know everything about particular work in that time they need to spend some time on the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it, because they need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things. For example we take an eroplane ,an eroplane was invented by wright Brothers they are very common people in the world,because they implemented an eroplane by usingbirds. one day they think about how the birds are flying in the air. At that time they had got one idea, that  the birds were having wings. so it was flying in the air. The Wrights brothers are different and take more risks to implement an aeroplane. Therefore what i am saying is that the people who are thinking differently from what they already know. If they are thinking similarly about the work. They don't get any new ideas and they do not succeed in that particular work. I conclude that the successful people who already know the work how to do well in that time also have a chance to implement the new things,but they are not thinking in a broader way. the successful people are always trying to implement new things,because they already know how to do the work.

The abundant numbers actually create a lot of problems for their city and the world. All these problems will finally force us to use fewer cars. Therefore,I agree there will be fewer cars in twenty years' time. The traffic problem is actually the most important reason for the increase in the number of cars. Traffic jams can seriously attack the economy. It can affect the run of the economic system. For example , traffic jams can delay the conveyance of goods of different industries, They can lower the productivity of the whole economy, Since that,different governments of big cities will tightly control the number of cars. To combat the traffic problem, the government will encourage people to use the massive transportation, just like the underway, and discourage people from using and buying private cars. The energy problem. Fossil fuel is running out quickly these days. The amount of fuel actually cannot afford our increasing consumption of them. This inadequate amount of fuel forces us to use fewer cars. It is easy to understand. If the population keeps on increasing, the demand for fuel will also increase ,so the price of fuel will rise.

829,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"The real cliche advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yogurt in a terrific place such as a nice dessert island.

However it is not really the product that is shown to be much better than it is but rather what is around the product.

So it is more the stuff unconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is.

In those cases the advertisement is more serious and there are fewerlies. All things considered I agree that very often the y, but it is not the least surprising and ; most people are aware of it.

832,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"This is a controversial issue to decide whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to just specialize in one specific subject.

The choice, nevertheless, is hard to make. However, from my point of view, it is wise to agree with the statement. My auguments are listed as follows. The important reason that can be seen by everyone is that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the requirement of our modern science and the work you do. When I entered into the social and started my first task, I knew that knowledge of one specific subject was not enough. For example, when you are examining project finance in a bank, you should know many things relating to accounting, project analyzing, risk management. During the process of evaluating those projects, it will be difficult for people majoring in financing to understand the prospect of projects such as steal, mobile and telecommunication. So, broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help you solve those problems. Another reason for my view is the trend of the development of science.

833,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations. I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products. So it will even cause the situation worse than now.

Therefore, they can make them look different sizes and more beautiful. First, tricking customers' eyes is a really good way to get more money. First, you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it look the desired to people. For example, I remember a TV show that was unbelievable to win a sports car if anyone answered the question shown on the screen. However, the question was so easy that I was going to call them.

841,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people. Some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide, they think that it is more quiet and peaceful. As for me, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. But I disagree with considering it as the best way to travel. First, most people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel. In some scenarios, it may be very dangerous for travelers. For example, if you travel alone in a forest where modern technology can not be used to communicate with the outside world. Imagine if you missed your way in the forest, met some dangerous animals or got injured by accident, how would you continue your journey. In this situation, it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide. Your friends can help you if there are really some bad things happening. And since there is a tour guide, the opportunity to experience some bad things may decrease. So you can totally enjoy your trip without always worrying about all kinds of situations. second, common sense tells us that human beings are social animals. So for most people, they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone. Imagine, you and your friends on a trip , you can talk about some funny things, you can share some feelings, or play card with your friends. People in groups will make you travel more interesting, you have more things to do. However, if you travel alone without a tour guide, you are deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends. However, I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Because modern society provides us with many opportunities to choose. Some people can choose to travel the other way by their own option.","['Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people.

842,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. Successful people always think about new things. Because that is their confident behaviour to achieve their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal.

843,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Nowadays young people are confronting increasing pressure from working and studying, and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday. Although it is true, I still persist that young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is generally accepted that almost all products of new technology are accepted, mastered and being used by young people first, so do the ones to provide convenience and enjoy themselves. Young students, for example, have got used to using cell-phones while their grand parents still use old and big normal telephones. Although airplanes have been common in China for tens of years, some older people still refuse to travel by airplane, because they think it is dangerous and a waste of money. Old people refuse to or don't know how to use many new products and can hardly receive benefits from modern society than young people. Besides, it is obvious that young people are the natural leaders of the new fashion, and it is also a common sense that entertainment, which is highly developed in modern cities, is always first accepted by young people. For instance, while I went to bars with my friends in my free time, my mother merely stayed at home doing nearly nothing even though she had enough free time. Only when she was invited to a bar by her younger friends did she find it really a good place to get released. Another fact is that a recent social study indicates that less than 70 percent of people who live in big cities of China receive benefits from new technology, and few of them are old people whose age is above 55. Moreover, enjoying life is not only shown through using the new products and enjoying entertainments, but also through activities in society. The social concept of older people is not OPEN enough even though freedom and democracy of society are progressing rapidly, especially in China. Several researches have already pointed out that people who are older than 48 are hard to accept the new concept of society, and by this they can hardly enjoy real freedom and democracy, which plays an important role in young people's daily life. From social activities I can release myself and win admire from others, which is essential to keep me feeling well.","[""Nowadays young people are confronting increasing pressure from working and studying, and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday.

I do not have time but when I see my neighbours I ask them If they need anything. I live in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters.

There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks.

First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences.

Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well.

In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work. are shown. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you would rather pay attention to the person or musician announcing the item than the announced item itself. Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportsmen or sportwomen are used in the ads.

On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more. Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future.","[""There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue.

860,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"For as long as college exists in society,the professors and students have debated whether having a lot of academic knowledge would be better or having specialized ones. The issue may not be resolved to everybody's satisfaction the answer is crystal-clear in my mind. Taking many academic subjects will be the best for your education. That many academic subjects are better for education is evident for several reasons. First, when you are educated in school or some institute,in most cases the students' goals in the future are vague. In this kind of situation the students will need a variety of information which will lead to their future being very attractive. To illustrate,my sister who is in college, has not decided on her job after school. However she is now taking many academic classes to broaden her knowledge and also make herself a well-balanced character which will lead to her future goals. Second,by taking many academic subjects you will get to know a variety of friends whose background and thoughts are different. For example,the college I had graduate offers many academic subjects in the freshman year. After ten years have passed,the friends I made at that time are still very good friends and influenced me. Nevertheless,some critics may contend that specific subjects will be more effective to educate workers for specific jobs such as lawyer, engineer, physician among others. However,recent graduate school graduates more well-balanced students from other areas.

Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others.

The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example.","['When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

873,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right. Take math for example, during my high school days, I had to answer lots of questions. A math teacher explained the concepts first, and then made us answer questions. If I could understand the concepts, it was not difficult to answer the questions. So when I studied other subjects such as chemistry and physics etc. I applied the same method, that is, understanding the concepst, first. Here is another example. In terms of parenting, especially money related, I think good parents are not the people who can give big money to their children but teach them how to make money. You might think this is a different story, but it is related to the topic, I think. All parents want their children to be successful and rich.","['Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right.

875,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In contemporary society, someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent, and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics. The current techniques are getting more complicated and the competition is getting more intense as time goes on. Therefore, it is more likely to be recommended to devote a specific field of study or work and to be highly qualified in it. First, the current field of research, such as computer science and electronic technology, which dominate the development of a current society, need very deft and highly qualified skills and knowledge. These fields of products change actually every minute. The cellphone which was produced early this year is already outmoded and a 2-year-old laptop is not producing anymore. Moreover, it is getting common to access the Internet with phones and laptops everywhere, and I can do whatever I want, like watching TV, movies, or chatting on line with my friends. Therefore, intensive and specialized skills and knowledge in electronic and mobile technology are desperately needed these days. Secondly, artists are getting more praised and encouraged because Art encourages people and helps them have a stable mental health. Thus, high In conclusion, being a specialist in a certain field is more remarkable and worthwhile to improve our society. General information can be accessed by everyone who can watch TV or can use the Internet.","['In contemporary society, someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent, and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics.

877,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years. Considering the facts it may be a good thing, if there were fewer cars, this would help our environment get healthier again.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

But how to change? How to get a better life? I think the answer is trying and risking.

It has been difficult, because of the language but also the loneliness , but it can be done, with willpower. Of course, often the way is harder than one had thought at first, and the end can be different from what one would like it to be, but without playing, winning is impossible, and so always, I think, it is worth trying to do better. On the other hand, obstinacy can become a serious danger to people. For example try impossible solutions because they are not happy with their life, or themselves. This behaviour can bring a person to ruin of his life. But I think this is mainly due to desperation. But it is an excess, and it is not the case with successful people.

As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the dearest thing of all. Secondly, young people do not have their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan for the future easily. Old people can not ever change their job or their partner in marriage. It makes the life of old people boring and less exciting. In addition to that old people have a heavy responsibility for their job and their family. In contrast, young people have a lot of time in the future; they can draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream. Finally young people, particularly young women can enjoy fashion and cosmetics. In the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women. This means that young people tend to enjoy a fashionable life and fashion brands target not old women but young women. Young women can spend more money than old women do because young women can use their money freely.

908,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for several reasons. First of all, successful people are able to learn and realize various things in their life and then they get a lot of information and knowledge through trying new things. For example, a person trying new things and taking risks can prospect and see the different fields with his or her experience. On the contrary, a person not trying new things and taking risks can not prospect and see different fields and also he or she may be embarrassed or surprised by these circumstances because of no experience. In fact, only a few people having experience of new things and risk can be possible to know the skill,like ""how to do this dangerous position"" ,""how to manage some risk"" as ""the statistics of the management ability in the dangerous environment. ""Actually, lots of successful people know this fact and they try new things in their various places or conditions. Second, people should learn and experience time to time because the environment has changed and is rapidly developing as technology.","['I agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for several reasons.

The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession. Another reason ,I believe that taking risks and trying new things brings success because it brings creativity in a person which leads to success in life. When we try new things in life then our brain works faster and we feel more challenging.","[""When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

They find their goal, their dream and they keep moving forward in their life. Because they had been young, they knew they had made some wrong decisions before. They are willing to make it up to them and make a better life. To me, I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Day in and day out, it is not hard to find young people committing suicide, they take drugs and go to rave parties. It seems they are so happy with their life. In fact, they are wasting their precious time. Numerous young people try to have different kinds of leisure in order to get rid of their stress like exams , complicated love relationships , family scold. In contrast, most older people have experience of knowing what mistakes they made in the past, they feel everyday is a good day, they enjoy their lives. They feel life is too short. Besides, they usually have more capitals to let them do more things like traveling. Most volunteers are from older people, they are more willing to give. They want to help people who are indeed. This is exactly what life should be. Life is about happiness, older people arrive at a destination where they can share their joy with other people. Next, when you see older people, you will always find a happy face on them. It is because they realize that life is running fast. So many worries that they had had before were not a big deal. Their valuable experience provides them with critical thinking. They mostly choose better choices than young people do. It always gives a better result.","[""Nowadays, young people usually spend most of their time socializing with their buddies, having parties, going surfing, going skiing and having fun.

As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to travel by bus, subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because of improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have the chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway. That is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling. On the other hand people's choices will change while travelling along the cities; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropolis city to a tourist city in Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car. Because for making another guess; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all. Time is a valuable thing now; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay for a plane ticket for not being late for life.

940,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travling costs a lot of money. Have you ever thought about how much you spend when you travel? A lot of people love travelling but they do not want to spend a lot of money on travelling. When people travelled to a different place about which they did not have any information, they would get lost while they were looking for the places they wanted to visit. Therefore, having a tour guide with you on your travelling can take you to beautiful places in a short time. There fore I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because by that, the tour guide entertains you and saves your time which are the most important things during your travelling. The first benefit of having a tour guide is that he entertains you. the tour guide has a big knowledge of the place where he tours you. For example, suppose you do not know about the good places in California and you went to them. If you did not have a tour guide, you would not have any good places except the ones that are near by your hotel. In addition, if asked people about the good places, they would not tell you because they might not remember them. However the tour guide job is to know the good places that will make the tourists entertained. Finally, the tour guide would try his hardest to entertain you, so that you might like him and tell other people about him. The second point is that the tour guide would save a lot of your time. For example, one of my friends went to Riyadh, which is the capital city of Saudi Arabia, with out a tour guide.","['Travling costs a lot of money.

941,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yes i agree with the concept of discussing that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Because by understanding the idea only a student can make decisions correctly. By understanding the concepts he or she can judge easily and can get through it. Most of the students understand the idea so that they can do things better and get a grip on that particular idea and also they can learn more things about the idea they learnt. For example a student preparing for his exams is coming over in a few days, to get rid of that he must read properly so that he does not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need to mug up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam. Understanding the idea and concepts the student can learn the facts. For example listening to the lecture in the professors' class there we need more concentration in the class, such that the student must understand the concept and perform well in the exam or in the seminar etc. By understanding the ideas and concepts he can perform them very perfectly. Ideas like in the software field we must learn and understand the concepts to perform well in our interviews, and also in the running project.","[""Yes i agree with the concept of discussing that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there.","[""I agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

946,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the topic. Young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities. Even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading. They really show up and help when the time comes for doing that. Consider the example of Katrina hurricane. The hurricane left many people homeless and made many children orphans. During that time students and other young people through out the world gave help. Students have established many camps around the victimized areas to help the people. Many people from foreign nations have also helped their best by donating their pocket money. Even though many of the students are busy with their college schedule, they devote some time to social service. Many students from clubs in their college help the underprivileged kids and others.

948,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing. Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives. In a way positively impacted us by being able to find a lot of things on the internet and make it easier for all ages to find things they would like.","[""It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age.

For example can everybody remember his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would never have allowed or something like that? And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels? Older people mostly just enjoy their life.

Someone's priority knowledge of ideas and concepts that students gain is the most important factor in education However, others may say that experiences from facts are an important factor for students. These priorities would depend on everyone's previous life experience. In my case, I grew up in a school that gave me a mixed educational method,and that the method was equally balanced. Since I recognise mixed educational policy, both factors are key to obtaining better concepts, and at least I can say both factors were needed and just one of those would not bring a significant result. When I was an elementary school student, I learned the concept of insects. That was the first time that someone told me a concept. I was engrossed in the ideas and bought many books about insects.

955,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people think students should learn the result of facts. Even though that is important for students, I myself believe comprehension of ideas and concepts are more necessary for modern life. People are able to manage their skills in their life easily. For example, when a person knows how to figure out math concepts, the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programming field. If the person wants to be a computer programmer, the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business. Learning facts is risky to interfere with students' motivation. It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover themselves to solve the problems. For example, in math class students always spend a lot of time considering to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process helps students to make motivation for studying. Finally, learning only results is not always true. Again, math class could be a good example. Many people notice that text books often have some mistakes. When a student only learns the facts, a student might misunderstand everything. Therefore, there are three reasons that I do not agree to learn only facts. Understanding ideas and concepts helps people to use their particular subject in their life easily. Also, this has probably to improve students' motivation for studying.","[""Some people think students should learn the result of facts.

For example, when a person knows how to figure out math concepts, the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programming field. If the person wants to be a computer programmer, the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business. Learning facts is risky to interfere with students' motivation. It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover themselves to solve the problems. For example, in math class students always spend a lot of time considering to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process helps students to make motivation for studying. Finally, learning only results is not always true. Again, math class could be a good example. Many people notice that text books often have some mistakes. When a student only learns the facts, a student might misunderstand everything. Therefore, there are three reasons that I do not agree to learn only facts. Understanding ideas and concepts helps people to use their particular subject in their life easily."", ""Also, this has probably to improve students' motivation for studying.""]","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
956,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""youth is blunder ,manhood is struggle , oldage is a regent"" This quotation really sets out the view towards the essay. I think older people can enjoy their life more then the young ones. For me age doesnt matter much when it comes to the enjoyment of life. Each thing that a young man can do , an old man can do too. The following essay will clear out my point of view Firstly,the experience the old person has ,for me the experience is the mother of wisdom ,so if your more wise more easily you can overcome the hindrance in your life. Old people are more aware of the outcome of life ,the phases of their life which they have been through. yes i do agree that young people do have more agility and fitness than old peopledo ,but if an old person keeps healthy by various exercise then he can also be like the current youth Secondly,the way you consider the enjoyment. If the young person thinks the enjoyment in life is going to pubs,disco,then the way could not the oldperson go towards this place. what fundamentally differs between young and old people is their age limit and age affecting their ability ,but I do not think age can be related toenjoyment. An old person does enjoy their life in their own way a way which would never lead to no dilemmas occurring in their life.","['""youth is blunder ,manhood is struggle , oldage is a regent"" This quotation really sets out the view towards the essay.

957,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth. It's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products. But sometimes,the products really disappoint clients. For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it.","[""I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth.

959,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you. The main point is not to think only about ourselves.","[""I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times.

That is because young people are busy with their business time and in their private time. Let me explain why young people are busy in those two times. In business time,young people are apt to have a lot of tasks compared to a business person in 20 years ago. In this two decades,most companies in the world have been decreasing redundant costs. So a lot of workers are dismissed. Consequently business people who can avoid lay offs have a lot of tasks which dismissed workers have.

The risk is a part of life and many people believe that this is the only thing to carry on living. I think it's very sad. The quotidianity is also very important and to appreciate small things in each day is an other way to live. This statement can have negative effects on people's lives. The teenagers often try things that are very dangerous to be appreciated by other members of a group. They take risks only to be part of something. They don't hear what their parents tell them and they do what kind of stupid things. They drive a car at high speed, for example. Recently, I was watching television when I saw a girl who had had an accident in a car. She killed three guys and she only said : "" Luckily, I wasn't in our place"". Incredible!

972,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Youth are the back bone of any nation. The development of a nation is in their hands. So they do a lot of things which include helping to communities. Being of the same group I would like to disagree with the statement. Youth have a lot of responsibilities in building a strong nation. Though they are involved in their restless work they do spend some time on the benefits of others. The strong reason for my disagreement is they help the community with their profession also. There are hell lot of young entrepreneurs who are looking forward to helping society by providing employment. I would like to mention the charitable organisations being established by various MNC's where a lot of young people work for them. They concentrate on various basic activities like drinking water ,laying roads, conducting awareness camps ,oldage homes. All these organisations are run by young people in a fantastic way. Though they do not directly involve the action they are the back bones of various organisations. I would like to notify you of this example from my personal life ,during our college days we used to dedicate 2 Saturdays every month to planting trees in various communities beside our college and we were aware of that and taking that spirit we are still continuing. The works done by young people do not attract mass media or other means as they feel it as a duty rather than responsibility. The awareness camp conducted by young people against AIDS has been an excellent program in the history of our country. Helping others need not require any organisation and work under it can be a small help that you contributed to others' welfare and especially for the needy. In a nut shell ,I state that being considered as a duty young people play a key role in improving the standards of society by contributing quality of work without being exposed to media beinga reason to supress our efforts.","[""Youth are the back bone of any nation.

For me there are three reasons why this happens. First the price of the product. Second the way of the owner presents the product tosociety. Last but not least the quantity of money that the producer will spend on making the product. Let's talk about price. The money is the one that moves the world. In the United States the biggest society class is the middle one , that means the worker class. Most of the population will be looking for the cheap product. The advertisements make the product look good and if the price is good people will buy the product. The first impression of the product, is what we first look at. The promotion is very important, if the advertisements convince the person thatthe product is good they will buy it. Also people do not have too much time to look at the difference between the products and if in the promotions it says that it is the best seller you will buy it without notice that doesn't mean that it is the best one. The company cost for making the productis the most important thing forthem. Alot of companies prefer safe money, to selling to the people a good product. A good example of that is the food, natural food is better but artificial flavor is cheapest, so flavor maybe it will be better but it is not because it is not natural. In conclusion will produce will make them products seem better than other because ofmarket competition. My advice is to always look for the contents of the products if they are foot, medicines or any supplements. If it is a transportation like cars, equipment, etc ; look at the material that is composed of which will help you to know which one is better.

Willing to travel along with a group of people is a good option rather than travelling alone. There were many factors which would benefit us while we were travelling in a group led by a tour guide. Firstly ,by considering the security factor which is a big task in tours especially in foreign countries ,we can feel more security while we are along with a group of people rather than alone. Even in the case of some tough situations we will get the support of everybody in a group. Secondly ,travelling in a group is economically more recommended than travelling alone. We can share the experiences and joy while we are travelling in a group and we can benefit from most of the expenditures we will face. Many tourism departments in various countries are offering good tourism packages for people who are coming for foreign tours. They are providing discounts and valid packages especially for people travelling in a group rather than travelling alone. Thirdly ,we can have a planned timetable and we can have a lot of fun all along the tour along with our group members ,we can plan more programmes and events which will entertain us along with our fellow members and we can even have a large.","['Yes , I agree with the Statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide "".

They think that many young people buy luxuries things,spend more and more time and money on the internet and video games. The older people,however,always spend their time doing the housework,or watching the TV at home. But is it true that young people enjoy life more than older people do? I think I cannot agree with this saying. Because every person in one's life has its own features. We cannot only say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Firstly,older people always think everything in their way,so maybe they think the next generation is not as good as them. For example,the kids who were born in the 1960s and after were called The Generation Who Can't Support. But they are the main part of the economy and power now. They are excellent as their father and grandfather. So the viewpoint that young people enjoy life more than older people is just a stereotype. Secondly,I think every old person has ever been young before. So they must know that young people are much more active than older people. They go to a club or play basketball when they are free. They cannot stop moving. But it is not to enjoy life,it is the instinctive of the young man. That does not mean that the young man enjoys life more than older people.

Nevertheless,I believe that in twenty years, this worrying tendency will decrease. First of all, it will be very harmful to the environment if the amount of cars tends to increase more and more. That is why, in the next few years, the government will have to take strict measures to prevent people from using their cars every day. There already are some measures such as when the pollution is too high , only certain kinds of car are allowed to circulate. But , as far as I am concerned, the government should do more and strengthen the law. They can develop public transport and make it cheaper for me. Moreover, the price of fuel has strongly increased, and it will cost and will cost more money to travel by car, even if other energy is developed. Many people cannot afford to pay more and will find more benefits not using their car, but rather public transport. An other reason makes me believe that the number of cars will decrease. Indeed, technological progress is more and more developed and performed quickly. In a few years, Cars will be replaced by some innovations which enable people to move cheaper, faster and easier.

990,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"My altitude toward advertisers has changed. At first, I hated them because they always cut my favourite TV programs into pieces. Now, however, I like it; numerous wonderful products in commercials make me feel that ""What a wonderful world. "". But when I think of advertisements rationally, I would say: Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of the function of advertisements, the improved measures to make a commercial and the psychological effects on money holders. As we all know, the function of an advertisement is to make a product sold better. Thus, a product will be described as good as possible in a commercial. After a deal, though a buyer would find that the product isn't as good as he thought at first, as a result of human's laziness, if the product is OK, he probably won't return it to the retailer. In this situation, advertising works. Advertisements good-looking also owned to the improvement in the ways to make commercials. For example, the IPOD, which is so popular among students that it's even a kind of scholarship in my school. The commercial for the IPOD uses artificial background and illustrated human body as a theme song. It successfully reflects the spirit of freedom and individualism, therefore meeting the needs of students' even though the IPOD's performance is not that good. The psychology effect of buyers also makes the commodities in commerce more attractive. When people watch a commercial, the stimulation of good pictures and nice voices which introduce the features of the product often makes them imagine a lot of functions of the product which they will never use in the future. Thus, the product seems worse than the on in the commercial. But it's not the commercial's fault, it's a mistake made by your imagination.

I totally agree that young people recently do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Or young people tend not to have any interests in others. Most elderly people say ""a long time ago young people had sufficient time for helping their communities. ""However, time is always changing, therefore, young people do not want to help or not like their communities at all. Even if their parents may not care about those communities, so they might not push their sons or daughters to go to communities. On the other hand, because Japanese people are studying so harder than playing, and some young people have to focus on studying instead of helping the communities, they do not have time to go to communities. Not only Japanese people study so hard, but also do Asian people study very hard if we compare between Asia and North America. Americans may have enough time to help their communities because I saw young Americans using my eyes. Also, I heard from my friends who are Americans that Japanese people are studying harder than Americans. It means that Japanese people do not have time to help their communities.

Yet, I think this question will have a varied answer due to the time it is asked. In the present day, new technologies keep being developed each day. For most parts, young children and adolescents are usually the targets of the technologies which are designed for them. The gaming consoler war (PS3, Xbox360, Netindo Wii) during last Christmas appeared to be a perfect example. The gaming market has targeted all the younger groups instead of those older people. Therefore, young people have more choices to relax right now and in the future. Also, most considered ""young"" people are still in the process of learning. It can have more possibilities to develop new interests while learning or trying a new thing. Once the interest is ensured, young people know how they should have fun with it. Yet, that applies to the present day. On the other hand, if this question was being asked in the past like in the 18th or even 16th century , then most answers may appear to be towards older people. In the past, young people had to deal with educational and economic problems harder than those well-established adults. The younger groups did not appear to have time to enjoy life before they grew  up. But older people might enjoy life as much as they can. By looking over the history, old barons and nobles had way more advantage in enjoying life than young children.","['Do young people enjoy life more than older people do?

1003,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"To my mind older people enjoy life more than young people and I will explain why. Despite the fact that young people begin their life, they will have a lot of things to do, a lot of places to visit and a lot of people to meet, they also face up to several problems. First of them, due to the aging population and the increase in study level, they will have to work for too many years to hope for a quiet retirement. In contrast to the older who retired around sixty years old. The young people will not benefit from their reunion because they will be too exhausted to do anything. the older people use their retirement to travel a lot or to take care of the children of their children. They have a lot of time to spend. In my second point, I will speak for those who think that young people enjoy it more than older people. They will argue that, when you are young you could do anything like going to a night club, spending your holidays with your friends or doing a lot of forbidden things. I will answer these people by underlining that older people have already done these things and the young do not know yet the pleasure of having a family : a wife who is in love and children. They do not know the pleasure of making a commitment during the wedding ceremony. My last point is that young people will have to deal with society problems that did not exist before, like terrorism. Indeed, our society becomes crazy. Relegion wars are very detrimental for the young future. They will have to find a solution to this issue if they do not want to live in a society ruled by fear and terror. In my opinion, only older people could help the younger to find the solution. Thanks to their life's experience they were able to find an issue. I will conclude my explanation by saying that older people enjoy life more than young people because with their age they have done everything and no young people can enjoy life more than an older person because they do not know yet what real life.","[""To my mind older people enjoy life more than young people and I will explain why.

1009,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Depending on the circumstances to which the question could be posed, the answers vary accordingly. Of course, young adults have completely different sources of enjoyment to middle aged people who in turn, have different enjoyment to a pensioner. Depending on where you find a place in this chain will distinguish what you consider fun. A younger crowd will enjoy attending parties, attending night clubs, doing rather challenging and more physically tiring sports. A middle aged person might enjoy playing a game of chess or maybe going to the opera and for that middle aged person, attending noisy parties and doing dangerous sports might not be enjoyment at all. Therefore, depending on the age that you have, whatever you do will bring upon it the correct benefit. There is a typically trend that young people believe that they enjoy life more than an older person because they believe that the younger you are the more fun you can have, this i believe is incorrect because, yes of course, the younger you are the more options of enjoyment you might think you mighthave. For example, a father of a child would rather spend time with his son or daughter rather than attend a gathering full of 20-year-olds just because he has different priorities. A young person would not enjoy spending time with relatives or older members of his family simply because at that age, you tend to have different obligations, different points of interest and a different type of mentality. Younge rpeople tend to feel that as your age you miss out on what is really fun, but we must remember that older people were young at one point and what a young person thinks a older person will never dream of doing, might just probably mean that it was already done.","['Depending on the circumstances to which the question could be posed, the answers vary accordingly.

For example if a young man wants to go for a tour in his holidays then the first thing that comes to his mind is where to go, whom to take, when etc but when an old person considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that comes to his mind is how long the journey will be and what all precautions he needs to take. young people can freely do whatever they want but older people may have many health problems which will restrict them from doing things which they would have liked to do. Young people can eat ,drink and do anything they like but older people will have many restrictions.

From 1980 to now the cars have grown about 4000%. The problem with this is if in twenty years we find a new method of transport faster, cleaner and cheaper and the car will be forbidden. For example, people in the 1930s thought that in twenty years there would be more ships to go from Europe to the USA because it was the only means of transport but twenty years later airplanes and desappeared the ships. Or the trains which were the only means of transport from a city to another city or town in the beginning of the 20th century. They were sufficient for the cars or the airplanes. Another problem is the survival of the cars if the oil which is not eternal, finishes. One day the oil will disappear and the cars will find other means of propulsion or disappear but I think that this is not the principal problem because now there are cars which use electricity, sun and other types of energy.

Iam of the opinion that because there are several reasons and examples ,to support my opinion. Man is a gregarious person and greedy person man who is a greedy person has no satisfaction with his already achievements. He is really keen to take risks and pains to invent new things. For example in the early stages scientistsinvented bicycles ,and then invented automobiles, planes etc. There is no end to invention ,because technology has developed day by day. Great people are always thinking and thinking they are always looking for some progress. Compared to the olden days, technology has developed more. Great people think there is no end to success,it is going on going on there is no end. If there is no meaning ,because great people are searching for better to best now days population are increasing like temperature increases ,if there is no place for human beings on land people can live on the moon also. So i strongly support the statement ,people want changes in life it will be help ful to better living. If great people are also thinking like this. They have no rest ,if they take a rest there is no further improvement in our lives.","['I do agree with the statement i. e successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

1017,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ? When facing these questions, different people may have different opinions. In my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts is sometimes more important for students than learning facts. My reasons for this are as follows. Firstly, a lot of knowledge in our world is ideas and concepts of things. Sometimes it is difficult for us to reach the facts because the technology we've got today does not have the ability to do it. For example, when we study biology, there are many things about our human body that we can't explain how they work, such as the memorial system in our brain. We can only guess it according to the limited consequences. So most of the time we only have ideas and concepts about these things. Students who can understand the ideas and concepts can help them develop their ways of thinking and proceed with their research. Secondly, knowledge in some scientific areas is very abstract. It is very difficult or sometimes even impossible to learn the facts. The art, for instance needs us to feel. The ideas and concepts of an artistic work are the only thing we can use to understand it. They don't tell us the facts. In addition, understanding ideas and concepts helps us to possess the ability to use the knowledge. If a student only knows to follow the facts and never thinks about them, he or she probably doesn't know how to use it. Their minds will be stuck with no personal opinions and wide imaginations. To sum up, nowadays, the most important thing for a student I think iscreation.","[""Whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?

1019,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The statement, 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is telling us that, to succeed, you have to try new things and take risks rather than always doing the way you are really good at. I agree with the statement. I think it helps to make something you are not really good at and make it one of the things you are good at. It also makes you experience many things and experiences success, and sometimes fail. That teaches us what is right and what is wrong. In your life, you have to try many things. When you are a baby, you have to try to get up and walk. If you don't start with that kind of risk, you will never walk, and not be like a normal person. Taking risks might be something very difficult. It might also be very easy. When you try something, you can like it, or you can hate it. It's all your choice. for example, this term, it tried for all the sports teams in school. I thought I was really bad at basketball, but when I joined the team, I figured out that I really liked it, and was actually better than what I thought. Making my self made me have a new hubby and try to be better at it. Trying and taking risks helps you to learn what is right and what is wrong. When you try, you sometimes succeed, and sometimes fail. My dad told me that failing makes you succeed more and helps you learn what to do next to not failing at the same thing. For example, my brother really liked tennis even though he didn't do it. When he tried, he found out that he didn't like it at all. From then, he didn't do tennis, and found out that one of his hobbies wasn't really his hobby. In that case, he failed and also succeeded in what he tried. He failed at guessing what his hobby was, but he succeeded in finding out what his real hobby was. I think successful people always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. It helps people to try and be good at something you tried. It also makes you learn what is right and what is wrong and makes you not make the mistake you did again when you do it again.","['The statement, \'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is telling us that, to succeed, you have to try new things and take risks rather than always doing the way you are really good at.

While the first reaction of some people may disagree with this statement, there are some compelling reasons to explore this issue in more depth. Concerning the status quo of today's society, I personally agree with this statement for the following two reasons. First, the atmosphere of competition is getting stronger in many fields, such as career or study. People treat educational degrees with more seriousness, and consequently, people are required to pursue higher degrees than in previous times. Nowadays, parents are aware of this change in society. As a result, they expect their children to pay exclusive attention to their studies, or specifically, to everything which is helpful to their education. Helping the communities simply turns into a waste-of-time behavior if it is not beneficial to the studies. In addition, the security problems also reduce people's willingness to help the communities. There are more crimes or robbery acts happening in the dark corner of the street all the time. Parents are worried about the children's safety, and as a consequence fewer and fewer parents or adults will encourage their children to hang out outside as long as the neighbourhood is alive with a signal of unsafty. there is one true example that happened to my mom. Last year she just walked home after work, she unfortunately robbed by a young man. Her bags were gone as well as some amount of money. My mother was terrifying, and she started warning me that I had to come home no later then six o'clockon any circumstances , and tried my best not to hang around the community because it was very dangerous.","[""A number of people have argued that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities.

1027,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly known that young people do enjoy life more than older people do. That is, in other words, age can sometimes be a hindrance towards living life to its fullest, and of course enjoying it to very far extents and dimensions. Nevertheless, i personally do not support and agree with this statement simply because the modern society lifestyle is not tied to age, old people do have more experience in life than younger people, and the spirit never gets old even though the body does. As a matter of fact, modern societies and modern lifestyles do not impose any age considerations as far as their activities are concerned. That is to say, old people can always do what is done by young people without being under the spotlight and focus, and no one finds it strange and odd when he finds them doing such activities.

Thirdly, I do believe that human bodies do get old under the influence of time.","['It is commonly known that young people do enjoy life more than older people do. That is, in other words, age can sometimes be a hindrance towards living life to its fullest, and of course enjoying it to very far extents and dimensions. Nevertheless, i personally do not support and agree with this statement simply because the modern society lifestyle is not tied to age, old people do have more experience in life than younger people, and the spirit never gets old even though the body does. As a matter of fact, modern societies and modern lifestyles do not impose any age considerations as far as their activities are concerned. That is to say, old people can always do what is done by young people without being under the spotlight and focus, and no one finds it strange and odd when he finds them doing such activities.

1028,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts. We need to first learn facts in order to get ideas and concepts. What would happen if one gets ideas or concepts without knowing the facts? I think it will lead to the misconception of the people whom one doesn't know. Without knowing the facts, we are not able to know the truth. For example, if one sees black people ,without knowing the facts, if one follows the common ideas and concepts of the black people, one might think most of the black people are uneducated and theifs. Or, if one sees Mexicans working on the construction site, one might think that they are all poor and uneducated. Or one might think all Asians are good at math or science, and they are all excellent in their schools. These are all misconceptions. People who don't know the facts could misunderstand the people around them. If one knows the facts first before understanding the concepts or ideas of the people, one can't just automatically put people in a certain category like that. Even though the person is working on the construction site, I know there are many people who are well educated and not poor. They just choose to work there.

1029,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The most fearful thing that people think of is death. Then, some people may say that young people have a lot of time to live compared to older people, therefore they can enjoy life more. It is sure that older people have a high possibility of death for various reasons, such as disease and weakness of their body. However, when death comes, it is unknown. Probably, a baby which was just born one hour ago may have died because of the sudden accident. Therefore I disagree with the statement which is ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do. ""First, each person has a different situation and environment. These situations and environments have a great impact on a person's life. For example a lot of children die because of disease or lack of food in developing countries. Their lives are quite hard. They do not know if they can live tomorrow or not, because they do not have any money and food. They also have to work for their family at a young age, and sometimes, they sell their organs to get money. Young people are healthier than older people, therefore they have to earn money. Probably, most young people in these situations can not enjoy their life. Therefore it is not true that all young people enjoy life and are able to spend all their time on themselves. Second, older people in developed countries may have a lot of free time which they can use for their own. For example, in Japan, a lot of older people can get money from the government after the decided age. Therefore they do not have to work, and they use this free period to do their hobbies, such as sports, music, games. and so on. It is not true that all old people enjoy their lives, but it is true that a lot of old people enjoy their lives by arranging their future.","['The most fearful thing that people think of is death.

1031,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Nobody can define what life is and what enjoyment is. Life and enjoyment both have different meanings for different individuals. A person may enjoy their whole life. But it is not possible to avoid the pains and sorrows from life, because these are part of everybody's life and come at different ages. Some pains are related to age, like physical problems. Some people face age problems early in their life and some people face problems late in life. Or we can say that some people become senile early, it depends on the situation which they faced in their life and it also depends on genetic factors also. I agree with this statement that "" Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". One reason to support this opinion is that undoubtedly the young person's energy level is higher than the older one's. Young people are more enthusiastic than older people and enthusiasm is a must to enjoy life. Older people's energy will decrease as their age will increase, this is a basic bilogical principle. A young person can travel and go wherever they want to go but it is not possible for an old age person because their body will not allow them to do so. Another reason is that the physical problems will restrict old people's activities, like they can't travel so frequently if they have a problem with jointpain. They can't eat what they want to eat most because their medical prescriptions will not allow them to do so. Old people can't take so much sugar in their food if they have the problem of diabetes. But a young person can easily eat what they want and they can easily digest it. They have no restrictions on their food. And taking food of our preference is also a joy of life or we can say enjoyment.

Basically a girl only has a responsibility to study and if she has finished doing it, she probably enjoys it by freeking out with friends to a good place orby going to some friends'house. But her mother who has a lot of responsibility like her daughter,and the other child she has so basically she is busy withher responsibilities. she doesn't at least not find time to enjoy herself.

So finally she is tired at the end of the day and she doesn't at least have time to enjoy herself and she feels it is time to take a rest.

It is because they know the reason why they are successful is because no one can replace their specialities. Moreover, doing what they are skilled at can prevent them from being lost. That a person has a job that no one can replace his or her position is a very important factor for a successful person. My father always told me that I have to find my interests, and become very skilled in that field. I totally believe those words because a successful person knows his interests and keeps studying them until he knows a lot about his interests. Take my professor for example, she is very good at translation. Thus, when some of the faculty members want to translate their books into English, they all ask my professor for help. They won't think about others. My professor can earn a lot of money by doing translation. Therefore, successful people will only do what they already know how to do because they know no one can replace them. Moreover, a successful person is successful because he does anything to prevent himself from being failed. Can a successful person still succeed when he is failed? I don't think so. For example, there was once a well-known company in my country. They were famous because they could produce nicely-looking computers.

1037,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three advantages. First, as you travel in a group led by a tour guide, the tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see on the journey. For example, if you want to go sightseeing, a tour guide will escort you to the sight. The tour guide will be responsible for whatever traveler wants to do. They just don' t have to worry about reserving a restaurant or doing some special activities. Especially when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoken in the country where they travel to. Second, since going travelling with a group, they will definitely get along with each other and have fun. If traveling alone, you won't be able to have much fun as traveling with a group. Third, traveling on a gourp with a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone. Of course a tour guide knows about the location where it is not safe enough to go so they won't go to the dangerous side of the city. Ever since transportation has developed amagingly, the world is getting closer. We can go to another side of the world by airplane in ten hours or it may take a day to get there. It used to take about two, three months to get to other countries. The world is getting more dangerous, most people have guns and knives. so traveling with a tour guide is very helpful for the traveler. In my experiences, I have been to Australia on my own. It was still scary to go there by myself. Especially in the town centre. When I went to town, I lost my wallet. i didn't lose my passport, though.","[""I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

When a person wants to learn the facts first he has to have some ideas about how he can come to the end point. first of all he has to make clear about the concepts he wants to include to achieve that destiny. For example, if we want to do some project to submit to a professor we have to have some dead time to finish,then we have to concentrate on how we can finish that assignment on time. first we have to create some ideas like which books we have to refer to,how we can present that paper,the order of the paper,we have to show to someone who can give us some more information that can be included,put the paper in a clear format and submit the paper. Factual information may be the true information to learn that before we have to understand what the hidden ideas and the concepts are. when we are in a family everyperson tries to reach a conclusion so easily about others but before coming to a conclusion about that person we have to have some idea about his behaviour that is how he talks,how he moves,how he behaves in the house,then we have to make a concept about that person then finally give the facts about that person. I conclude my passage by saying that every person,for example a student should create an idea about which graduation he wants to complete and what courses he is interested in and prepare a concept of what is required for him to complete the graduation. take some suggestions ,know how difficult it is and then enter in to the fact that he wants to end up with that certificate of graduation in which he is interested in joy.","['I agree with the following statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

If a person wants to enjoy his/her life they can enjoy it no matter how old they are. Enjoying life doesnt depend on how old a person is, however; it depends on how the person is. being sociable, appreciating what you have, and having a positive way of thinking are all characteristics a person contains but it differs in people, what kind of person they are.

If a person dislikes being around people then he / she wont be able to enjoy life because he/she is not seeing people from different cultures that entertain you. This unsociable person would end up being alone not wanting to interact with the outside world. One of the major reasons that would make a person enjoy his life is appreciating what he/she has. If a person does not do so he wouldn't be living that of a nice life. For example: If a poor girl is friends with a rich girl and this poor girl wants to wear and have what the rich girl has, that is a big problem because the girl would not be able to afford certain things. By not appreciating what she has she would suffer alot and wouldn't really enjoy life.

I use the car everyday and i cannot imagine life with out it and because of that i think that there will be more cars rather than fewer in twenty years. You can argue that: Petrol is running out!.

In twenty years i believe that prices are going to increase, fewer people are going to be able to pay that price, people on shorter incomes will have to use other ways to get around and therefore the number of cars will be expected to decrease because people wont be able to pay the price but the problem is that there are other fuels that can be used and people will get used to having cars which are slower and less comfortable.","['Cars are the most used form of transport known nowadays will that change in twenty years? it is very hard to answer.

1042,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"These days, many technology systems are developed. For example, we could play in many ways these days like playing an X-box in their houses and going to the movie theatre. On the other hand, old people might not have a chance to play or watch the movie at the theatre with their friends. Not only playing to enjoy life, we could also find our new jobs easily and find their habits easily through the internet explorer. First of all, many young people these days play X-box in their house. Probably in the old days, they just played outside of sports like basketball or soccer. However, these days, we can play soccer or basketball in our house using an X-box. The new technology systems affect us in many ways. For example, we are allowed to talk to someone anywhere and at any time we want. By calling or e-mailing each other, we could find an enjoyable life. In addition, many young people these days also go to the movie theatre to watch the movies. In the movie theatre, we could choose the movie we want to watch. For instance, scary movies and sad movies. By watching them we could have a fun time in our spare time. Also while we watch the movie we can also eat any foods we want. In the old days, they didn't have any movies, so probably they all watched the news all the time. Finally, we could find our habits and new jobs easily by searching on the internet explorer. For example, we are interested in skiing in the winter break, then we could search for a place where we could go for the best and we could even learn how to do the ski. By searching and finding out from the internet explorer, we could find out what habits are. For instance, when I started to chat with my neighbor and I enjoy it, then it could become my habit. In conclusion, many technology systems affect a more enjoyable life than older people did before their life.","[""These days, many technology systems are developed.

Energy and desire are the two main components young people experience when accomplishing their short or long term goals which keep them happier than grown-ups. Despite the common thought about retirement to enjoy life, recent studies show that 99% of old people do not enjoy life like younger people. The first group have got what they were looking for in their lives: a family , a beautiful house, enough money in the bank, among other things. Besides, it is a shame that getting the retirement they do not have time to travel to, to be attentive to some interesting things just because of health problems. They have to go and come to the doctor's surgery, spending their money on paying refills for their medical prescriptions. By contrast, younger people have energy , desire and many new goals to accomplish. Even though they seem to be very busy they are really happy because every day brings something exceptional to their lives and it has to do with their happiness. In conclusion, being younger means having energy , desire to achieve long term, short term goals which makes you enjoy life, more than older people.

In developed countries we can perceive widespread usage of public transportation.

1053,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As far as I am concerned, the best way to travel is a free tour. In other words, I think not planned tours will give us a more pleasant experience. You may argue that the group tour led by an adept tour guide can show us more things to see and feel, but it is just a second-hand experience just given away to our hand by another person. In my case, I am planning a New york tour in two weeks. I've saved my spare pocket money and earned money from part time jobs for two years. I prepared sightseeing visa and flight tickets just on my own without any help from a tour agency. It gave me self-confidence that I can do anything for myself. It was a little bit hard work to prepare documents for applying for a visa and the cheapest flight ticket, but I think it was a reserved thing to do. You can save time by preparing your travel with an agency and a skillful guide, but you cannot get the experience of doing something on your own. Moreover, self planned travel can give you a great experience different from a group tour, which has to obey a timetable scheduled by a tour agency or guide. People who go on a trip with a guide can see famous tourist attractions and get the same memories as others, but tourists without a guide will go anywhere they want to go even if it was not a planned thing to do. A plan-less trip can give us real freedom because no plan is our plan. I think Many tourists commit oblivion to get freedom.","[""As far as I am concerned, the best way to travel is a free tour.

It was a little bit hard work to prepare documents for applying for a visa and the cheapest flight ticket, but I think it was a reserved thing to do. You can save time by preparing your travel with an agency and a skillful guide, but you cannot get the experience of doing something on your own. Moreover, self planned travel can give you a great experience different from a group tour, which has to obey a timetable scheduled by a tour agency or guide. People who go on a trip with a guide can see famous tourist attractions and get the same memories as others, but tourists without a guide will go anywhere they want to go even if it was not a planned thing to do. A plan-less trip can give us real freedom because no plan is our plan."", 'I think Many tourists commit oblivion to get freedom.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
1054,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The distinct difference between young people and older people does not exist and to make this distinction is difficult. Also, deciding which is more enjoyable is a more complex issue. Young people are more energetic and full of dreams, while older people are at ease and satisfied, although such differences depend on the situations of their abilities and lives. I will take the position that older people enjoy life more than younger people, and discuss it below. The most important characteristics of older people are money and time. Most successful people have a lot of money and a lot of time in their everyday lives. Even younger people such as famous entrepreneurs are wealthy but they must be busy and have a rare time to enjoy their time leisurely.","['The distinct difference between young people and older people does not exist and to make this distinction is difficult.

So it is better to study and have knowledge of various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject.

However, I agree with the topic for two reasons : capability and social relationships. I will explain these reasons in detail. To begin with, broad knowledge is a capability which has one of the factors in modern society. Nowadays society wants people who have diverse abilities. Also, many universities offer various curriculums to students. For example, my sister has many abilities, such as English ability and resources of economy, policy and art. So when she meets people, almost all people like my sister. One day, she went to the bank to exchange his dollars. Hence, she saw some foreigner. So she asked for something to happen and the man answered that he did not find their company, Therefore, she talked to him and resolved the problem, After that, she got some requests to get a job. This means that ability is useful for living in society. Second, it is good for sustaining social relationships. People want to make relationships with brilliant people. Moreover, they need to obtain a good qualification to get  a job. Besides, many private institutes to learn creat in our society. Among them, language courses are a good example. At my University, Kookmin University, there are many courses in language such as Chinese, Japanese and English. Consequently, many people concentrate on the course. Therefore, the courses are finished enrolling. Also, my university offers a conversation course for students. It means that it is useful for students. In conclusion, I support that information about many academic subjects is better than information about professional subjects for the following reasons. First, it is an ability which modern people should have. Second, it is eligible for keeping social relationships.","['People have different opinions on whether having general knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. people who disagree with the statement argue that specific knowledge is useful to get better jobs.

The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do can not be true in all situations. Most people have bad things happen in their life. It could happen at any stage of life.

1096,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"The phrase quoted ""YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES"" is a factor that lots of adults think may be true. But, I totally disagree with this. The youth of today are very enthusiastic about their given responsibility, their job & their concerns regarding the work that they need to put forth. In this fast paced life of today, with severe competition that comes along from every corner of their life, this makes it impossible for young people to dedicate much time toward their community or to take any social cause they want to do. They are so engulfed in the work, they already have very little time to just be by themselves. Well one may consider that these are the reasons for a youth not to do the helprequired. But, I would like to say that inspite of the hardlife they have developed these young people never forget where they are & what they stand for. Many young people take time out of their busy schedule to dedicate time to the community they live in. These young people have actually even started making their voices heard. For example, the recent Medical Quota that the government had proposed for the benefit of the so called lower class of the community at the expense of merit was greatly put forward by the Medical students. Not because they did not want the upliftment of the community, that was socially biased by are administrators, but for the fact that they just wanted these seats to be given to the more deserving students who may be in a very economically challenged & brilliant student. Today's youth are more about general development than development in a particular area. They just love experimenting in life. The youth of today have gone ahead of their voice to stand for their opinion, to stand for themselves in the purest of all the heart that is needed. Inspite of the on going corruption which  is eating our nation from every corner they still want to eradicate it for a.","['The phrase quoted ""YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES"" is a factor that lots of adults think may be true.

Cars can make our lives easier by saving us time and energy. As cars are getting more and more commonly used, the energy needed for cars is getting lesser and lesser. As a result, the energy crisis occurs, and which becomes one of the most important daily issues to us. I believe in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, because of the scarcity of energy, and the innovation of technology. It is obvious that there are more and more cars on the streets nowadays. But has anyone aware of the huge loss of energy? Probably not. Cars will not work without gasoline. As more and more gasoline is purchased, it becomes scarcer. In the economic view, when a good or service is getting scarced, the price of the individual good or service will increase. That is what's happening with gasoline nowadays. As the price of gasoline rises, the living expenses also increase. In the end, people will not use cars as much as we do now. And this is because of the scarcity of energy needed for cars. When the situation of scarcity of energy is happening, people tend to find many ways to solve this problem. The innovation of transportation might be the solution to this problem. Scientists who work on energy development might create new energy instead of the traditional energy, gasoline. With the help of these scientists, the solution will either be having new forms of energy, or new forms of cars that consume less gasoline. Therefore, traditional cars will no longer be used in twenty years. In conclusion, the scarcity of energy and the innovation of technology can reduce the number of cars in the next twenty years. Scarcity of energy leads to the rise in living expenses, which will finally force people not to use cars as much as they do now.

1108,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"There are some people who think travelling led by a tour guide is better, but others prefer to travel alone instead of being guided by a tour guide. But I would have to say, if I was faced with this issue, I would probably follow the tour guide's leading in a group. In the following discussion, I would like to reason and provide examples to support my viewpoint. No issue is more important now than the one that refers to safety. History witnesses and presents many examples of when travelling by oneself may cause some dangers or trouble. For example, we go to a less developed country,such as China, and take money in hand, this behavior may cause some dangers. Or when we travel to an European country with unpolished dressing. Don't you think the examples quoted above are very persuasive? Convenience is another head and chief reason that I have chosen to put it here. It is no better illustration that can demonstrate the view. If the trip is not convenient, it will take the travellers too much energy to enjoy their trips. Even family as a couple. they will be uncomfortable on a busy trip. Superior as leading by a tour guide, leading by tour guide or deciding on a trip by yourself also has its own demerits, too. Deciding on a trip course may take a lot of time and may lose something interesting. Leading a tour guide may lose one's freedom to find something else besides the tour. Nevertheless, the advantages of leading by a tour guide carry more weight than the disadvantages of leading by a tour guide. So the most striking conclusion is obvious. To sum up, given the reasons discussed above, which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive, we can safely reach the conclusion that leading by a tour guide on a trip is more safe and convenient.

To sum up, given the reasons discussed above, which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive, we can safely reach the conclusion that leading by a tour guide on a trip is more safe and convenient."", ""In fact, not only do I prefer to travel leading by a tour guide in a group, but also prefer to hire a personal tour guide for one's own tour guide to serve himself as well as possible.""]","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"

1111,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In Korea, students who are before entering a university should memorize most of everything to prepare for the university test. Why should we memorize everything? I think understanding those things and experiencing them are more important than just learning. There are a number of reasons. First of all, If students just memorize ideas and concepts for their goals such as entering a university, getting a job, and graduation, will they remember it a long time? I think the answer is ""NO"". Because their ultimate goals are not learning and understanding for themselves. Thus, they have just studied to enter a university and if they enter a university, they will forget it easily because they have got their goal yet. Second, if students don`t understand ideas and concepts, those will be futile. It is because although they study those things, they don ` t try to understand ideas. If they didn`t understand, would they use the knowledge? and then can we call that  knowledge ""? The learning that is not being understood is just waste.

1113,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, I think all companies do. I think a lot of people could agree with this statement if they have their own experience of it. Actually, the main goal of advertisements is to make huge profits by selling the products. To do this, they should make a good image of the product, and the product should appear to a lot of people. If it looks not good in the advertisement, people will not buy it. So, this skill is very important to sell the product to the consumers. Sometimes, people buy something without any information. I think this is because the advertisement already built their nice image on people's minds. I have my own experience to support this. When I was in my country Korea, I saw an advertisement for a mini radio from a famous company. It looked really cool and useful to me, so I wanted to buy that mini radio. It was brand new and it was much smaller than mine. I always wanted to have a small radio that I could take everywhere. I ordered that mini radio after I watched the advertisement on television, and when I received it I was surprised. She was not that small. It was just ' a little' smaller than a regular radio However, in the advertisement that I saw, it looked so small such as my little MP3 player. I was very disappointed and I gave that to my older brother. After that mistake, I never ordered the product just by advertisement.

You might want to see around other places but since it is moving with the group, you will not be able to go by only your feelings. Secondly, the tour guide will decide the time they are looking for, so you are not able to see it as long as you want. Different from travelling by yourself, a tour wants to go to as many places as possible to have more customers. So they are not able to take enough time to see each place because they have to go next on time. This might be OK for some people, but others might think they are not satisfied. Thirdly, there will be many other people that you do not know.

1120,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but there are several reasons for this and it is not always the case. With the huge rise in consumption society, more and more products are proposed to the customers. Most of the products are really similar. How does the difference between two bottles of water which have the same price make a difference? This is the role of communication and advertising. Companies will present the products in a better way. They will associate it with a lot of qualities and significations. With advertising, companies create the image of the product, and this image makes the difference when the customers buy the products. So, the customers don't have to mix the real qualities and specificities of a product and his image. For example, a brand of water shown in one of his advertisements is about babies dancing and swimming in waters. That doesn't mean that each person who drinks this water becomes a baby and jumps directly into a swimming pool. A second problem for companies is how to sell a cake or a fragrance by advertising? People can't taste or smell the product. Consequently, advertisements suggest the flavour or the taste of the product, and as everybody has his personal tastes and preferences, everybody doesn't always agree with the advertisement. Finally, advertising doesn't always present the products in a better way than reality. Advertisements are controlled by law and the associations of customers. Companies can't lie about theirproducts, lying advertising is punished by law and in this case the company loses all its credibility and the trust of itscustomers. To conclude, advertising makes a product seem better to make business. It doesn't lie, it improves the reality.","[""I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but there are several reasons for this and it is not always the case.

1121,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Young People And The Community I think that I would have to agree with this statement, according to nowadays young people dont help or participate enough in their own communities, and I mainly think that this is because of the world today and its busy busy busy life. Because nowadays a lot of young people can't even afford to lose time on playing or engaging in any kind of fun activities, Because they can barely make it from home to college and from college to their part time work (if they have one) and then going home again to do their chores and finish studying and doing their homework , which takes a lot of them dropping them beat on the bed at the end of the day. But then again this does not apply to every young person, some people choose not to participate in their own communities because they do not think that the community itself is not doing a good job maintaining things at hand, and so they dont want to interfere with the bumpy roads ahead. But also there is quite a fair amount of young people with plenty of free time who would love to help their communities to prosper and to feel good about them selves as individuals in doing so, and not to forget that working pro bono for the community means no money, and not many people who would want to waste their time and not get paid in the end, so sticking to their jobs is the better answer for their time. So in conclusion, I do agree with the statement that young people dont give enough time to help their own communities, but at the same time I disagree that they should help the community and give their time and efforts away on the count of their futures, but this does not apply to those young people who dont think and give much time to their future or their community because they should, after all,.","[""Young People And The Community I think that I would have to agree with this statement, according to nowadays young people dont help or participate enough in their own communities, and I mainly think that this is because of the world today and its busy busy busy life.

If you did not understand what it was talking about, you would never get the facts of it. My English teacher always says that way to me.

When we can get all of the above, we will understand the ideas and the concepts. Trying to read it more than once, it would be easier to get what it says in the reading. I always do that way, because I want to get higher marks for every test or quiz. When we do that, we will learn more when we read. Learning the facts is not really a bad thing to learn.

If you did not understand what it was talking about, you would never get the facts of it. My English teacher always says that way to me. If we want to learn good English, we should read it more than once to understand the idea. It likes the characters, setting, plot, and the background. When we can get all of the above, we will understand the ideas and the concepts. Trying to read it more than once, it would be easier to get what it says in the reading. I always do that way, because I want to get higher marks for every test or quiz. When we do that, we will learn more when we read. Learning the facts is not really a bad thing to learn.

1123,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge rather than specialized in one specific area. This is because everything in this world is related to each other and you cannot solve any problems or do something new without having other knowledge. For instance, cooking, chemistry and biology seem all different subjects which don't have a relationship with each other. However, they are strongly connected with each other and you won't be able to do any cooking without having knowledge of chemistry and biology. You might think not all people cooking at home have had a chemistry class and biology class. I take your point; what you have thought is absolutely true. What I want to say is that you don't need to have professional and deep knowledge of them. For example. if you want to cook meat, what do you do first? This is maybe depending on what meat you are going to cook and how tough it is and how big it is. If this meat is too big to cook or eat, you need to cut the brock into smaller pieces.","[""I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge rather than specialized in one specific area.

They could enjoy their life by traveling or taking risks in some adventure , doing dangerous things or crazy things, while old people have their families and their responsibilities to take into account. Young people also could go to some entertainment places with their mates such as pubs and discotheques where there is so much noise that old people couldn't bear it.

Evenif they fail once they will try anyway in their lives for new things. Which makes them great successful citezens. I was always encouraged by my father to do new things so that i could give wings to my mind and think beyond and become a successful guy in my society. which brought me several prizes by participating in the science fair. Also when people try to do new things they will adopt them and they will get habituated to them despite the difficulty. Also trying new things would also give some self satisfaction for oneself. If we do a new thing and succeed in it we feel proud ofthat. It will also be fun to do new things. Kids usually have this behaviour is that they would like to play always with new toys or other things which they like the most. A candle light would be so attracted that they would like to touch it which may cause rick for them but unknowingly he does it and finds out what would happen if he touchesharmful things.

1131,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In many schools and institutions it is believed that the importance of learning is by memorizing facts and concepts other than actually understanding them. We are facing two very different types of learning and teaching, and I personally think that the best way is to integrate and comprehend. In the older days, teachers left instructions for the students to memorize and copy facts, dates, names, numbers, among other things. Then, the student wouldn't have passed even 1 year and he would have forgotten everything the History teacher told him to memorize about the second world war. It wouldn't have been of any use memorizing in the first place. Now, on the other hand, I think that a more modern type of teaching is by making the student identify the problems and understand the answers. For example, in mathematics or physics, instead of the teacher giving the formula to meassure the air, or to find a number, let the student find the formula by himself. In a way, I think this type of teaching helps the student to develop certain abilities and its easier for them to solve problems in the near or distantfuture. I think it is very important to actually use the whole percentage of brain we are capable of using and to think, and figure out our own answers. We are not born with the abilities we have, but we reforce them, make them stronger. In my personal opinion, it is much more important for us (students) to understand and comprehend ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn and memorize them. Besides, memorizing is always boring. Its funner to learn by applying this type of teaching.","[""In many schools and institutions it is believed that the importance of learning is by memorizing facts and concepts other than actually understanding them.

In contrast, I strongly believe that students do not spend their time helping their communities because they not only focus on more difficult exams, but also tend to become self-centred. First of all, these days, a lot of difficult exams or tests make students spend more time. Young people study hard to enter more prestigious universities. Thus they focus on studying rather than helping their communities. According to research by Chosun-ilbo, one of the leading newspapers in Korea, a number of students who give the seats to the elder or visit the pagoda or silver house. The research indicates that 70% of students respond that they do not have enough time to think about other things, instead of studying. On top of that, teenagers do not think about whether other people are poor or not. They have a tendency to self-centred. In the past, many students considered their communities when communities had special parties or festivals for reconstitution of communities, so they frequently helped install tools or stages. The best example of this is that my father helped make stages for the rural festival of harvesting. He said that at that time, most students who lived in their communities gave their hands in order to succeed the festival. On the other hand, when our communities have a beach festival every summer, even though our communities ask for help, no students emerge from the cite to install stages, hence the festival failed. In this respect, at present, students are self-competent compared to the past.","['It is debatable that teenagers, these days, put the time to help their communities. a rapidly growing number of people think that young people also help their communities because they belong to a wide range of groups and those groups participate in helping communities.

1139,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I completely agree with the statement which says that "" Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"". Those people,who are well known, often want to be more popular and to attract more and more attention. We can talk about politicians as an example. Like Bill Clinton,former president of the United states of America,or Nelson Mandela,ex-president of South-Africa,who are helping the poor countries in africa and asia, a lot of this category of people work in organizations which have the same purpose. Another example is the entertainment artists. Many singers after being very successful and popular as singers try to move to Hollywood where they have the opportunity to start acting. And they even take a lot of risks like investing in a lot of businesses all over the world. The benefit for them is that they are known and they use their name to attract people;and even if their investment does not succeed , they are always able to try other things because they have the money they need. In the United states a lot of artists,singers and sports -players have their own company or team. Consequently,months after months,years after years, they become more and more successful and popular and try new things. Consequently,they seem to handle the world in the palm of their hands. In conclusion,people who are successful definitely try new things and risk;they rarely just do what they already know how to do well and most of the time, they do it to get more money thanthey own.","['I completely agree with the statement which says that "" Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"".

Take the example of the following cases: 1. if the above fact would have been true then at university there would be no specialization in any subjects and all the students would opt for all the subjects. but in the current scenario this is not applicable in any part of the world which itself is an evidence of the effectiveness of the above logic. 2. take the example in the medical field. as time goes on new and new diseases are affectingmankind. in this situation only the person who has experienced in the corresponding field can go for research for the curement of that disease by means of biotechnology and will ultimately land up with some specific kind of solution. 3. take the example of the engineering field. how can we suppose to think that a person who has no experience in civil engineering and in construction will be able to make a dam for society. if he goes for this purpose the govt. will itself not allow that person to build it. even if by any means he is able to penetrate through all the hurdles then in that situation he can not give the guarantee about the dam which he built.

1144,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Is a group led by a tour guide the best way to travel? I think it is, because when you go to a new place, sometimes you don't know the city well or you could take the risk of being missing. If you go to a new place, it would be better to be guided, so that if you have any doubt or any question, you will be sure that the guide will have the answer. You do not have to be concerned about knowing everything about the places, the buildings, the ways and you will only enjoy the trip. On the other hand, if you travel by yourself, without a guide, you must ask for some address or building name if you do not know it. It would take more time, it could be frustrating and it could make you spend a lot of money on taxis, buying maps or getting back from wrong places. A tour guide is a person who knows the places that he or she is showing, and he or she would teach you some history, because he would talk to you about the places you are visiting, its origin, its name, about what it is made of and all kinds of things that would take a lot of time to learn. It is safer for a person to travel in a group and with a tour guide because they do not take the risk of visiting dangerous places. The tour guide would tell you what places are safer, at what time is better to be and the right moment. Travelling in a group could be better because you can learn from the other people. If you don't know the name of a specific building, another person could know and tell you. If somebody else does not know the history of a specific place and you do, you could teach him or teach her.

1149,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The issue of whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts is commonly discussed in our society. In my opinion the students' knowledge is improved when they understand not only the facts but the underlying ideas and concepts. In this essay i will support my answer with specific reasons and examples. Facts are definitely the students' knowledge base. Before any consideration the students need to know what happened. So teachers need to explain the facts without any comment or personal opinion. At a second, facts are separated into ideas and concepts. Teachers should help students to understand what drove the fact and what consequences it had. In our society is really important not only to know what is happening but also to understand the ideas and motivation. A great example is 11/09. Everybody saw what happened on the twin towers. The real knowledge comes from the understanding of nature and the cause of the terrorist attack. Only in this way can students go directly to the problem and try to find a solution. In conclusion I completely agree that students should analyse problems by learning the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts that are behind the facts. Only in this way will students be able to find the correct solutions to the problems that they will occur into.","[""The issue of whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts is commonly discussed in our society.

1150,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, there're so many debatable issues about young people's life style. In particular, some people think young people don't give enough time to helping their communities, so they look down on young people. However, I think the young generation spend enough time on their communities and they shouldn't spend more time helping communities. Because there's a major volunteering class ( in school), young people have numerous things to do without helping communities and young people's time is for dreaming. First of all, there're a lot of programs to make young people help communities, and almost all young people do it. For example, almost all schools force students to spend time helping communities in Korea. The required volunteer time is high, and connected with the grade. In that way, young people do help their communities. I think it is hard work for young people, and they have done well until now. Second, we should understand that the younger generation has numerous things to do and they want. When I think of the young generation from junior-highschool students to 30's, it's easy to guess that they are really busy. School, company, friends, family. Their heads are already full of things to concern them. In my case, I'm 21 years old, there're lots of things to do at my school and house. It involves homework, studying, housework. Actually, I couldn't breathe easily. There's no time to think about something unimportant. Like me, other young people have not enough time to draw the dream and future.","[""Nowadays, there're so many debatable issues about young people's life style.

Because there's a major volunteering class ( in school), young people have numerous things to do without helping communities and young people's time is for dreaming. First of all, there're a lot of programs to make young people help communities, and almost all young people do it. For example, almost all schools force students to spend time helping communities in Korea. The required volunteer time is high, and connected with the grade. In that way, young people do help their communities. I think it is hard work for young people, and they have done well until now. Second, we should understand that the younger generation has numerous things to do and they want. When I think of the young generation from junior-highschool students to 30's, it's easy to guess that they are really busy. School, company, friends, family. Their heads are already full of things to concern them. In my case, I'm 21 years old, there're lots of things to do at my school and house. It involves homework, studying, housework. Actually, I couldn't breathe easily. There's no time to think about something unimportant."", 'Like me, other young people have not enough time to draw the dream and future.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': True}"
1151,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"without hardwork and risks,we cant succeed in our life. I totally agree with the statement. Only by doing some new things , can we invent something new in this world. Alonso was f1 formula race winner last time. He tried new things on the track , and through that he won the tournament. He got lots of risks but finally he won the tournament. That is important. Every field needs news things to do. In the medical field,every successful scientist needs to do some new things. Only then can they invent some new drugs. By doing already known things that will help us to do the particular thing perfectly. But by trying new things it gives us some success in our life. For example,once Michael Schumacher was a successful man in a Formula 1 formula race. But,last time he didnt perform well and he was replaced by an Alonso russian driver. The main reason for his failure was ferrari formula cars,because he had nt tried his drive with other engines like mclaren,tata etc.","['without hardwork and risks,we cant succeed in our life.

1160,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Well, this is an interesting topic to be written about. Coming to the point of knowledge, it means mastering a field of work at study. And this is divided into many branches like different subjects we take. Many people try to take a few subjects or a single subject alone for their studies. This also counts for the field out of education system. This could be for the reason that they are interested in it and like to work on it. And moreover, people who are job minded, would work intensively on their subject of choice to master it and a good job based on it, leaving the other subjects unexplored! According to me, the involvement of a person in a particular type of job is totally need based. But I would prefer to work on all the areas and gain knowledge of everything around me, then concentrate on what I need to. This could be a pretty good way to do our job. You will have the minimum knowledge of everything. This ought to be followed because, you cannot keep quiet when a group of your friends is discussing a particular topic. You need not be familiar with it so that you can atleast join the discussion. Or else it would look odd if you did nt join in the talk. Afterall our skills are guessed by the work we put up. And we can also advise someone on a familiar topic we know. For example, lets take a person who is very well aware of a subject in which he is interested, but is unaware of many other things. And take a person who knows about all the things he is interested in, and also the other things. For instance let us imagine an interview conducted for each person. And in today's world, a person who knows his subject of interest and the other things also, is only accepted. That would keep him an allrounder. Though the other person is a master in his subject of interest, that alone would not help him.

1164,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with this because the thought does not exactly consider the situation of young people nowadays in the modern community. And really does not have support for its argument. It would be acceptable if it is proposed that this is a general situation for all people but not only young people. In the days we live life is getting harder for all, living seems to be getting harder. People have certain needs to survive like food, houses and things like  that. Moreover if the person is the only worker in the family and has kids she or he has more responsibility. Despite this most of them really try to work harder to make their community aware of that if their community does not exist this will also be the end of them and their children. As in my situation although people need to work to earn money for them and their family to live they spend all their energy digging all the ground to live. But in such a bad condition too, they try to help others in the community. I have many friends that can run to help anybody that they do not even know before. A short time ago one of my friends saw somebody shot in the middle of the street, after the voice and overcoming the shock he ran to help the man who had been shot. After his attempt everybody in the street came there to help. In such a dangerous situation, you can find more people than you expected. They create groups and teams to participate in social work to help improve the community. We have one of these teams. And in this group i have met many people full of desire to change conditions not only for them in a selfish way but also for their community and for human beings, spending a really long time on only those kinds of things. This sentence has absolute judges does not mean sense to me.","['I disagree with this because the thought does not exactly consider the situation of young people nowadays in the modern community. And really does not have support for its argument. It would be acceptable if it is proposed that this is a general situation for all people but not only young people. In the days we live life is getting harder for all, living seems to be getting harder. People have certain needs to survive like food, houses and things like  that. Moreover if the person is the only worker in the family and has kids she or he has more responsibility. Despite this most of them really try to work harder to make their community aware of that if their community does not exist this will also be the end of them and their children. As in my situation although people need to work to earn money for them and their family to live they spend all their energy digging all the ground to live. But in such a bad condition too, they try to help others in the community. I have many friends that can run to help anybody that they do not even know before. A short time ago one of my friends saw somebody shot in the middle of the street, after the voice and overcoming the shock he ran to help the man who had been shot. After his attempt everybody in the street came there to help. In such a dangerous situation, you can find more people than you expected. They create groups and teams to participate in social work to help improve the community. We have one of these teams.

1165,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Nowadays, some people prefer to travel through a travel agency while others prefer to travel by themselves. There are some advantages to traveling in groups led by a tour guide such as safety and getting some information about the place we travel from a tour guide On the other hand, there are some disadvantages such as following rules and no private time. I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. There are three reasons why i prefer to travel through a travel agency. The first reason is that I am worried about safety when I travel. if we travel in a group, it is safer than travelling by myself. I heard some tragic stories about a couple in China. The couple who had just got married in Korea, went to China for a honeymoon.","['Nowadays, some people prefer to travel through a travel agency while others prefer to travel by themselves.

1166,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Now there is a general debate about whether it is better for people to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. Different people have different ideas. As far as I am concerned, I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. There are a lot of reasons to support my idea, but I will only explain some of them due to the limited time. To begin with, if people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, it will be easier for them to find jobs. That is to say that if you study a large amount of subjects, you may gain job opportunities very quickly and change jobs freely. A good example is the part-time job. If you have lots of knowledge of many academic subjects, you know both English and Ecnomics well, then there will be many jobs readily available for you. Working as a manager in a big company to show you economic skills during weekdays, you may teach English in a training school, standing in front of the blackboard, pronounce ""A. B. C"". This experience will be extremely interesting for you, you must enjoy it very much. The second reason is that you may be more intelligent by studying many academic subjects. Recent research has shown that people who learn knowledge in different areas will be more clever than those who only specialize in one scientific subject because these people's ideas are mangled to jump from one field to another field easily.","['Now there is a general debate about whether it is better for people to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject.

1167,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"There are some differences between young people and older people. I want to explain important points about their characteristics. First, young people are more active because they have to go to school, they have to learn what their requirements  are. They also have to grow to become what they want to be. Though, they are growing up, there are a lot of struggles that they have to face. They are confused and lost because they can not see what is going to happen next. Second, think about older people who are calmer and have knowledge, and go done with their development. They can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school. They may have time to think about their grand children who they got. But there are things that they can not do which is going to school, playing sports beyond their average , being expert at some new thing. So some limits come up to them because their age is increasing. But it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do. For example, if you want to have your own time to relax, sleep, talk with friends, it seems like young people have time for those kinds of things, but young people may not do it because there are a lot of things to do like home work, sports club, planning for university or job. But older people may do it because they have time, maybe they are having a job that they really want to do. School work is hard to have fun, there is such a limited time, they are still struggling with everything. Older people can enjoy what young people enjoy, if they want to play sports as much as young people do then they can do it. Young people can not do exactly the same thing as old people do.","['There are some differences between young people and older people. I want to explain important points about their characteristics.

These days the advertising has become so popular that some people even have this belief that they can not sell a product at all with out advertising it on television or radio or wall posters. The first and the foremost thing in most of the advertising industry is presenting something bigger better or more unrealistic than the usual product. These days there are advertisements for everything from a mole hill to a mountain. And these days with the advancements in media (radio, television , the internet) the advertising has become so easy and so effective that it is delivered to each and every person and anyone who encounters that advertisement tends to buy that product. They are so impressive. Even if we go to a gas station there is a discount, for clothes, for medicines ,,,,, for every thing there is some bonus (so called) to the customers, which is just ,in my opinion, another start to improve their business and get profits.

He really advertising more than his needs or showing something to others which isnt true. he has money but its just that he doesnt want to work at all.

1171,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In this era, where it is possible to underline an increase in production, most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are. This is a result of a great number of products that the owner of the companies has to sell to the consumers. For this reason i agree with that statement. I think that ,in this period, everyone who has to sell anything wants to show it in a better way than it really is. It is possible to find products that have a very low price but at the same time they are probably not very good items. Now where the Internet has increased its importance in selling products, all people try to show them in a fantastic state with beautiful pictures and one very accurate description. For example one year ago I bought a support for a mobile phone for the car. When it arrived at home I observed it and I noted that it was not as good as on the computer. The material that it was made of was very very bad and an optional item, that I bought with the support, didn't arrive at home. It' s possible to find a lot of advertisements on television that show all the items in a very beautiful way and I think that anyone has to pay attention before buying a particular product. I think it is better to buy items of a brand that is known. In this way you are sure to buy a good item if its price can be expensive. The most important brands have a great experience of working and they use all kinds of machines or material they need. In this capitalistic era infact there are many people that open an industry to sellingproducts. To have very low costs they use a material that is not good. This occurs for example in China where the prices of the products are very cheap. I had a lot of experiences with buying a product that were not good as they were shown, for this reason I suggest buying a very famous product! !.","[""In this era, where it is possible to underline an increase in production, most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are.

1177,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Nowadays, many people can see lots of advertisements. that is very effective for people. so, making an advertisement is very important for the company.

1178,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"""Big risks bring big opportunities"" I can not remember very well but I heard it or read it somewhere which says that by taking risks you gain a chance to be well-off. I agree with this agreement and also agree that successful people are the ones who take risks and try new things. There are lots of things you can do to be a successful person. You should work hard, try to learn, and watch the new technologies. Although these make you successful they are not enough for being successful. For instance you can know every thing about your business \ you watch every improvement in your job, you work hard. However you do not have the courage to imply this information to your business. Then what are you going to do with them? People try new things and take risks in order to be successful. Firstly people should try new things. Today the world changes fast and you have to follow these changes in order to be successful. For example you have to learn theinternet, or how to control your e- mail. Nowadays every thing runs from the internet and by e-mail. Because it is one of the fastest and the cheapest ways to communicate with long distances. There are few people left who use letters to communicate. Secondly, I think this one is more important than trying new things is taking risks. Taking risks is the key factor that brings you success. If you always do what you already do really well you stay in where you are. Taking risks has concluded with different solutions and also higher revenues. However one important thing about taking risks is you should think carefully and be well prepared before you take the risks. Because besides big opportunities it can also bring sadness.

As a conclusion taking risksand.","['""Big risks bring big opportunities"" I can not remember very well but I heard it or read it somewhere which says that by taking risks you gain a chance to be well-off. I agree with this agreement and also agree that successful people are the ones who take risks and try new things. There are lots of things you can do to be a successful person. You should work hard, try to learn, and watch the new technologies. Although these make you successful they are not enough for being successful. For instance you can know every thing about your business \\ you watch every improvement in your job, you work hard. However you do not have the courage to imply this information to your business. Then what are you going to do with them? People try new things and take risks in order to be successful. Firstly people should try new things. Today the world changes fast and you have to follow these changes in order to be successful. For example you have to learn theinternet, or how to control your e- mail. Nowadays every thing runs from the internet and by e-mail. Because it is one of the fastest and the cheapest ways to communicate with long distances. There are few people left who use letters to communicate. Secondly, I think this one is more important than trying new things is taking risks. Taking risks is the key factor that brings you success. If you always do what you already do really well you stay in where you are. Taking risks has concluded with different solutions and also higher revenues. However one important thing about taking risks is you should think carefully and be well prepared before you take the risks. Because besides big opportunities it can also bring sadness.

However, today most young people think they don't have time to do that. Instead of that, they spend their time going to the private academies to develop their own career. Second, there are lots of things for youngsters to enjoy. They spend most of their time enjoying their own interests such as watching movies , shopping, or playing games.

1191,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people. Enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people of all ages. There are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other, all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurrence. Both younger people as well as older people have problems to face in life. Each age group's enjoyment is curbed because of these problems, but the enjoyment is never far away. Lets take the example of a young boy. He does not enjoy it when he has to give exams, study, or go to school. However, he enjoys it when he goes to play, or when he watches television. In the same way an adult (middle aged) does not enjoy going to work, or working around his or her house. But they do enjoy it when they come back from work, when they are on a holiday, or when they go to a party. In the case of old people as well, they enjoy it as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds. But they face problems regarding their health. So this way every age group has its own share of enjoyment and problems. We cannot draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or less as there are various factors such as time and society which decide that. Along with this there is also the fact that one's enjoyment can be another's problem. In contrast, children enjoy playing more and studying less. The adults (parents) have problems with that, which curbs their enjoyment of seeing their child study. When the child is forcefully made to study, then the parents' enjoyment becomes the child's problem. In the case of old people, their enjoyment is that they do not need to work. But this is a problem for adults ( middle-aged) as they become a burden on them. Due to this, old people are sent to shelter homes where it is a problem for them, but enjoyment for the adults.","[""I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people.

For example, I am Electrical Engineering so I have a background in electronics and technical aspects, my last work was Project Management so I learned about Risk in the projects, financial stuff, logistics, management of human resources. I have a friend, His profession is architect and he reads a lot about different subjects because he is trying to apply mathematics, psychology, and marketing to the decoration of a room. He analizes the psychological profile of his clients and tries to design according to their interests and hobbies. People who have broader knowledge can manage more tasks and can do jobs that others do not know. Its easier to explain how to make something to a person who has knowledge in more fields. On the other hand, some activities require specialized resources for example people who repair, and build airplanes. Those works need specialized knowledge, but need more years of specialization in a field.

First of all, young people nowadays tend to care about themselves more than paying attention to other people. With a highly developed society, there are many more interesting and significant things occupying young people's minds. For instance, they would like to spend two hours or more reading books in the library or seeing videos and playing computer games at home instead of helping their communities which may gain them nothing in the near future. Furthermore, most young people nowadays are not aware of the idea of a ""community"" anymore. The identity of being part of the community is getting weaker and weaker. Some of them even don't notice about their living in a community. For example, apartments and houses have become the main style of buildings nowadays. Young people leave their houses in the early morning and come back to the very same place late at night. How can we expect them to know each other from their neighborhoods? This kind of lifestyle weakens young people's identity of community. Naturally, they will not pay attention to a society which they are unfamiliar with. Finally, considering this so-called efficient society, tasks relating to communities are almost done by certain workers or employees of these communities. In this way, a community becomes an epitome of a factory. Everyone has his own job and only does what he or she is asked to do. Take my family's community as a real example. We hired four people to do every task in our community.","['I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

The second reason is to create a new project if the student takes on one subject if we take the above example java course. The student can create new things like if in the based on the java course he can create web sites and quick transactions.

Usually older people have less opportunities than young people have because of their age and also they have worse health than young people do.

1210,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I think I agree with this statement. As far as I am concerned, I think that there are two ideas which can support this statement. First, recently environmental protection awareness has been rising rapidly. People nowadays realize that air pollution is getting worse and worse because of cars. Thus, in order to give their generations a better environment to live in, people may begin to decrease driving cars to the places they want to go. Instead, they will start choosing public transportation, such as MRT, tram, and bus, to get to the place they need to go. Moreover, the payment for a car is not cheap at all. For example, when you get a car, you have to pay for the oil and maintenance. I dare to say it will cost you more money than spending money on taking public transportation. Second, oil is becoming less and less though scientists have done their best to dig oil and find where oil can be. Oil is one kind of natural resource and the formation of oil must be very long, so it is not limitless. However, oil is essential for cars. Without it, people can not start cars at all; then, people will reduce using cars step by step. I think that the above I wrote can explain why there will be fewer cars than today. Just remember that the quantity of oil is limited and one day it will be gone,and the government have spent lots of money on establishing public transportation. Where does the government get the money to create public facilities? It is from people who pay taxes. So, we, people, have to enjoy what we have invested in and live better lives for our next.","['I think I agree with this statement.

1222,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Over the last sixty years, advertising has increased in a huge way, in conjunction with the expansion of commerce-based societies. But it often occurs that we have the feeling that advertisements are a cheating on us by making some products better than they really are. Who never experienced buying something, thinking it would change his life, and being afterwards deceived by the product ? When we see a tv-advertisement, for example, we are giving us an idea of a product that doesn't always correspond to what the product really is. The only way to make this match this idea with reality is to test, and sometimes we are deceived. Why are we fooled by advertisements? The problem lies in the fact that we tend to trust what we perceive at first. An item might seem huge in the picture, but it is in reality tiny. We are also fooled by numbers. Political rhetoric in the public debate is always used by politicians who talk about percentages, but without telling the truth. For example we can say that the unemployment rate of young people is 25% percent, although it's the percentage of young people that don't follow studies. What's the goal of advertising? How would we know that a product exists if advertising didn't exist ? In fact marketing is a necessary step in the development cycle of a product. There are a number of stories in the engineering field in which an innovative technology has been created, but so little attention has been put on the marketing behind that product, and thus the advertisements, which never became known to other companies or consumers.

1233,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Nowadays, there are many people who believe that only doing what they already know how to do well is true. Nevertheless, I absolutely disagree with this point completely. I think that successful people try things and take risks to become successful. There are many successful people who also take many high risks before they / become successful and well-known. Bill Gates is a typical example in this situation. When Bill Gates was still a student at university, he realized that he would be a great man and hired by a big company with a great amount and stable salary after he graduated. Although he realized that situation, he still decided to take a risk to abandon his studies and started to invent some software. Moreover, he asked one of his friends to abandon studying and go with him to create a business. Nevertheless, he rejected it eventually. A few years later, Bill Gates became the richest man in the world with several millions of dollars. On the other hand, although his friend graduated from the University of oxford, he was only a manager of a small company. An other example is my father, he was not skillful at studying when he was young:therefore, he started to create his own business instead of studying or working for a company for many years. Now he is a very successful person and my idol. In conclusion, I think people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. It is because if we are not skillful at studying or working for others, why do we have to waste our precious time doing things without any result. Moreover, I think people should try new things when they are young, because it is useful to regret them when they become old.","['Nowadays, there are many people who believe that only doing what they already know how to do well is true.

1234,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I am completely positive about the statement. Here i would like to mention some reasons why group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so i guess i confirm the advantages of group travelling. First of all, tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. Group travelling people can defend themselves in difficult times and it is more likely to attract public attention for requesting help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of the high velocity rate. The second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel costs. Needless to say, it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists, not only discounts, but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or a certain number of members. The third reason serves our company's main goal, More people, more fun. It is very interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches and other attractive entertainment. Travelling is not only the meaning of travelling, but of making friends and getting relationships with them.","[""I am completely positive about the statement.
