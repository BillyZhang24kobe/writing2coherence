476573.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"60% of people who work do not have time for entertainment because of their work. They can not do anything about this. So I think young people will enjoy life more because they have a lot of free time, they are healthier and they and they usually do not have children.","The young people have a lot of free time, and their life will not be affected if they waste it.",1
136505.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ignorance is far more important than knowing the facts. understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher. humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the facts from the early stone age we understand concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubbing two stones together thus understanding the process of combustionby using stones. we cant simply rely on the subject by knowing but for understanding it. for example every one knows about the law of conservation of energy,a person who understands applied in the form of electricity or mechanical engine. A student who got good marks in an examination ca not become a good engineer or doctor or infact, be good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good. Thus, application is important for a student who comes with an understanding of the subject. A practical understanding of the subject is preferred rather than simply knowing it ,this is the reason why nowadays education orl study is based on formal work rather than simply class room teaching. each and every course of today whether you take a science or art or technology project and the field work isintroduced. The concept of understanding does not give us success in profession but also helps us get better in our subjects which we do not want to get for our lifetime. this doesnt happen simply by knowing. a student should not apply this to the study but also to the various aspects ofdaily life. this can better not only a person's life but also his relations with other people thus ultimately his life stands are also increased. this aspect cannot be overlooked. Opposing side should be made to be taught in the schooling stage itself. finally understanding makes perfect not only good academically but also in life.",fe.,1

754426.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In my opinion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject. In other words, I think one should do the former first, then do the latter. From my experience, I insist like that and I can explain more details. First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree.",Anyway now I am a military officer and preparing to enter into post graduate school for public policy majors.,1
450516.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement which is ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. ""Why do I agree with that statement? First, because of the population. Many people try to succeed in one subject so the rate of competition is very high. If people who have knowledge as well as general people, they cannot be on top in the major. Second, if people who want to succeed are afraid of taking risks, they mentally or verbally cannot move from the point where they are now. They should take risks and get knowledge and experience from risks. They have to grow up with their knowledge and experiences. That's why I agree with the statement. There are a lot of people who want to succeed with the same major.",Even in one school there are a lot of festivals.,1

1073024.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Creativity and innovation is an ongoing concern of the business entities. Recent activities such as new programs which aim to encourage people to use their creativity in the projects. Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result. As in our immune system, our body will respond to the invading pathogens more powerfully in subsequent exposures than the first one. Besides these, human beings can sometimes be on pursuit of new tastes in order to renew their lives and refresh their souls. life consisting of eating and sleeping is not worth living so how many years you lived can not be as important as how you lived. People who are afraid of taking risks to add up their lives in fact do not want to violate their identities. Therefore they continue to go in the way which they know well.","however, there should be differences between human beings and plants in order to put them into other groups.",1
328055.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car.",The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least.,1
969074.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","NO,I don't agree with this statement. Because,now a days present - day technology is improved a lot. People are introducing four wheelers with different models and different infrastructure. Not only this four wheeler and two wheeleralso. Nowadays, buying a car has become a prestige issue. So, everyone goes to buy a car if they have enough money. Most people in society feel that if they have a car then only people respect them. Nowadays, there is no person without a car those who have enough money.",People now a days only use cars in large numbers.,1
1037117.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is true that students, today, are really more inclined to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts. Though it is not what is supposed to be can we blame the students? The education system in many countries, itself, requires it to be like that. And today world has nothing to do with the `facts` indeed. in many countries education systems are so restrictive and so close to development and research that students find themselves in an environment which is totally close to the facts. when using textbooks is the only option the students have and when they are expected to be successful in a kind of competition at the end of which the winner takes it all how can we expect the students to possibly try to reach for the facts? the system forges the students to be tend to get the ideas and concepts. In addition to that we live in a world which has nothing to do with the facts. for there is not a unique objective `fact`. the facts are made not occur any longer.",all the facts are mere deceptions.,1

115743.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statemen. Successful people try new things because they want to get a new degree. There are several reasons for this. All people who have alot of achievements are n't satisfied with trying new things. As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life.","In my opinion, this knife is better than the other.",1
264742.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career.",Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices.,1
437612.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The world is developing day by day. New thoughts, new technologies are being applied to make developments.

1937595.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Cars have made such a difference in our lives. they have made transportation easy and doing the ritual things like visiting our parents or a family member easy , going to the doctor now is easier than it was in the olden days. i dont believe that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years , if anything there will be a surplus of cars maybe technology will affect the cars but there will be an increase in the usage of cars. Cars might be in a different structure to keep up with technology and might have new gadgets but the illimination of cars has quit hard for the past century god bless henry fords heart we have depended on cars and as long as i have been alive cars were the only means of daily transportation and to me the safest transportation. Also another point i would like to make is that when a generation more like a century gets used to using cars it will be quite difficult to eliminate this source of pleasure and vital everyday use. A car is what brought me to this test center to take the TOFEL exam and without it i couldnt imagine any other means of transportation that i would be able to use on a daily basis. Generally speaking transportation is extremely vital and we can not live without it.",cars will be around for a long time until we invent a new way of transport and may i add a safer way for example zooming us through laser or zapping us to the exact position we would be found in.,1
1477499.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree, but!. If we have to be very optimistic, because you never know what is going to happen with the wars and the growth of radicalism in the world. Also we have to take a look at the audience who can demand this kind of product. Everything, is so complex if we see the Petrol market, Thousands , of people, are die every month directly or indirectly because of this problem, so. Of course the first world is asking for the development of new industries in this field of consumption (cars) and this also, demands a lot of petrol and a lot of social politics inside the problem. It is a delicate tool to use against the arabian world to impose his power to take the fuel for the cars, because directly or indirectly all the industries of the cars ( even if they exist in Japan) have something made in America. In my opinion,. it could be too long to explain my real idea about that.","I mean , last week I got my driving permit, Now I am crazy about driving, I would like to buy a cheap car to carry my Double-bass with me, to go to the gigs without the help of anybody.",1
297801.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I disagree with "" The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. ""Tour guides usually offered you a tight schedule which meant you were in a hurry all the time, and therefore you could not enjoy yourself much on your trip. A tour guide usually planned your schedule tightly from the early morning to midnight. You could seldom enjoy yourself as you were too busy moving from one attraction to the other attraction. I think most people have experienced it before. While you wanted to stay a bit longer at one attraction, the tour guide would tell you to go back to the shuttle bus and you could just stay at that attraction for a maximum of 30 minutes. You were not able to understand deeply about the real life of that country or the attraction because you would not have enough time to explore it by yourself. You needed to be prepared for a long and boring explanation before you could visit the attraction. You also needed to wake up early in the morning for the full schedule for the whole day and you would be able to go back to your hotel at midnight. The schedule offered by the tour guide was not always suitable for your own habits.",Maybe you didn't like roller coasters but they would take you to the most famous theme park in that country.,1
905111.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The statement affirms that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies. On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them. The second compromise would be with the environment, trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but, of course, trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to pollution problems But on the other hand , we can also view the coin by the other face. Even if technology can be improved during the next twenty years, it will be very difficult for normal people to achieve all the advances. In that case, in the non-developed countries and maybe in many developing countries, cars could keep their own place as the main means of transport. It is not too difficult to think about the implementation of the changes in the case of Africa, the poorest continent of the world. Even in Europe could not be possible to erase or to decrease the number of cars in the next twenty years. There are many countries with problems in that particular area that have been trying to solve them, such as Italy, Spain and France. and they failed. In Latin America, and I think also in North America, a car is a symbol of power and of prestige. In that case I think it could be difficult for the change of mind for the next twenty years. To all the things I pointed out I must add the fact that daily all car companies are producing new models of cars, faster and moreluxurious, but not thecheapest, to improve and to renew the old models.",Tokyo Motorshow.,1
1172673.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""Young people are strong and dynamic"" These words are proved by great scholars and philosophers of our country. I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands.",Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs.,1
1427763.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"As my boss used to say to me at the beginning of my career: < Do not be afraid to try new things, do more than others do: no one has ever been punished for doing more>. According to this phrase, I think that people who try to do new things normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who simply does his/her usual job. What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to society. A lot of men can do things well, but only men who do things better than others can reach a higher level in social life. Taking risks is part of being a successful person. Someone who does not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by society.","For example, in cartoons, a superhero is someone who normally takes risks to do something more dangerous than other normal people do.",1
70247.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days. But personally I believe that education and society give young people the chance and the time to have contact with communities to help other people. First, the school focuses on the importance of volunteer work in the community these days, so that students give more time to do volunteer work than before. For example, when I was in high school, the teachers set up the volunteer committee which gives the information and chance to do volunteer work in the hospital to clean the rooms. In addition, the school produced an event where students pick up the trash around the school once a week. The experience of attending volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students. That experience gives me the chance to have contact with my community. I was very busy studying, but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities. According to the newspaper, the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer work these days. This example demonstrates that schools make enough opportunities for students to help their communities. Second, the community has a chance for young people to help their communities.","For instance, In Tokyo, where I live, the number of robberies and fire accidents caused by people is increasing.",1
1076677.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I partially agree with the given statement that ""young people enjoy life more than older people""because young people enjoy life by playing with friends,by watching thelatest movies,by going to colleges,by teasing younger people etc. where as older people enjoy life sitting at home,chatting with the people surrounding them,going to piligrim places etc. Younger people now a days have a lot of fun life to have for example if we consider the case of my brother he enjoys a lot. he goes to college on a bike,he meets friends every day in the evening,he will have a big chat with them about the movies,he then goes to his classmates' house to have a fun time with them about the funny things that happened on that day,finally he comes home and has a good meal and then he goes to sleep. If we take the case of older people they have work to be done,for example if we take the case of my grand mother she is quite relaxed,she usually gathers the other people and she starts chatting the whole day it is a kind ofentertainment for her,she watches old devotional movies with them and enjoysfeeling about god,some times she used to go to piligrim places like tirupathi,shirdi etc.","she used to eat the food she wasinterested in ,she used to spend money as she wished.",1
993195.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"LIFE IS LIFE! Young people enjoy life more than older people do. I don ` t agree with this sentence. Because some old people are young , so they enjoy life. Also all ages have different surprises in life. When people are young, they can enjoy life so much. First of all, everyone must enjoy life every age, other wise you can bore in life. But when you are young, you can enjoy life more than everybody else. Because you want to try everything in the world. You want to go everywhere with your friends. When you are young, you have lots of energy to do something, you want to live life, you want to see everything. Sometimes you can learn some lessons about life. It can be good or It can be bad for you. Also, when you make lots of things, I will look for extra things. You want to live in city life. You can go to bars, cinemas, restaurants. like lots of things. Also you want to earn lots of money to buy expensive toys, because this is life. But in ages you will be an old man or woman. You can live lots of things but without something. Because in the first paragraph I told you. Life has something in every age for you. when you become old. You can enjoy life. Maybe you dont like city life, you can move to the seaside or a little town. You can grove your fur, or you can play with your daughters. When you become old, it doesnt mean life is ending. That was the reason you can do lots of things when you become old.",But not extraneous things because you wont afford them.,1
753065.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The speed of development concerned technique is so fast today, and more and more speculate about what will happen in 20 years. Some of them believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I am hesitant to agree with the statement, and the reasons are listed below. Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before.","If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today.",1

184250.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Success means inventing new things , which can be done by experiments and taking risks. It's not only restricted to successful people rather than to all people who are failures too. As success comes only by experiencing opposite results. It will be a new experience if we take risks and invent new things. This boosts our confidence and gives us a new experience. I agree that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already knew. Firstly successful people try new things because as they already tasted success in their life this gives confidence to work more by taking risks. Scientists are good examples of taking risks and trying new things. If scientists didn't try new things then we would nt be able to access the inventions which they made like pencillin, steam engine by james watt , aeroplane by William brother and so on. Secondly people try new things in which they get new experience. If a person is doing a know work for the past few years this not only makes him bored but also loses his interest in that work. While experimenting with new things we can get more knowledge in the subject which gives us soul satisfaction.","Today we recognise scientists by their works , but we don't recognise a daily worker in a factory.",1
698140.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts is very Important. The subject like java, we can know the knowledge of java by understanding the ideas and concepts. concepts are more Important than facts. By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented java,we can't understand the features ofjava. we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts. facts can also Improve knowledge. By studying the facts like Independence we should know about the great leaders of our country ,and we should know about how they will work hard for Independence. History will tell about this. So learning the facts was Important. By studying the facts the children can learn about the honesty, reliability , and history of the country. Everyone should know about the history of the country.",By learning the facts we can prevent wars like the second world war and the first world war.,1
622011.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work. Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them. In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures. A person has to love his work to create new things and to succeed indeed. By taking risks you learn new useful things that help you in your life.",My brother was in a running race and he not only won but also created a new personal best.,1
266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker.",He tried to buy his cat.,1

1090891.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In general, younger generations enjoy their life more than older generations do. This is because young people have knowledge or skills to adopt now. Older people find it difficult to do that. But, older people had the time to adjust to the world, and they must have enjoyed it at that time. So, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. In fact, I am in the young generation right now. I, of course, enjoy my life. Going to school, exercising my body and exploring new worlds are all enjoyable for me and other young people. For doing them, pioneer spirits, healthy bodies and motivation for getting new things are required. However, it is a heavy task for olders. Among them, some people still have those powers, but most people tend to be less motivated.","For example, my grandmother does not want to do anything except for her rutines which are to take care of the household or talking to only similar people ondays.",1
263985.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with this statement. This statement isn't true for all young people. In my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping. I have been a scout leader for four years. I give my free time to care for children, to think about games which I can play with them and to help them if there is any problem. I dont get any money for this, I do this because I like it and have fun almost always. Of course there are situations where I am nervous and tired of entertaining children, but all bad emotions vanishes if you can make these kids happy. So it depends on the education and the surroundings of a young person, whether he (or she) is willing to help his (or her) community. Not all people have this social ambition that I have. I can imagine there are people who only want e.",g.,1
263612.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right. Take math for example, during my high school days, I had to answer lots of questions. A math teacher explained the concepts first, and then made us answer questions. If I could understand the concepts, it was not difficult to answer the questions. So when I studied other subjects such as chemistry and physics etc. I applied the same method, that is, understanding the concepst, first. Here is another example.","In terms of parenting, especially money related, I think good parents are not the people who can give big money to their children but teach them how to make money.",1
221642.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"We are living in a particular period; we are being hitten by advertisements: when we walk along the street we can count a big face with the same product on his/her hands, or when we are listening to the radio we can listen to a particular voice that tries to convince us to buy something, when we switch on the tv there is always some spot with funny music. In each place, in each situation we are covered by advertisements. It is easy to ask ourselves if the products that are presented are so brilliant. I think that a lot of the time it is so: most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I can say this for different reasons, first of all because the objective of the company is to sell their products, and so they use all the methods that are necessary to convince people to buy them. Second because a lot of time people buy a particular product not for its quality but only for its mark. For example we can think about food: what are the differences between one biscuit to another? A lot of the time the difference is the price: the product that is well-known is more expensive than the other, but if we taste the quality we can' t understand the difference because they are equal. Another example that I could consider is about clothes. There are a lot of people that want to wear only one type of, for example, trousers because there is a little spot on them. Probably it is only to be fashionable, but this traffic, which costs a lot, isn' t different from another. The last consideration that I can do is that advertisements hit our unconscious attitude and so a lot of the time we choose products that are published in an unconsciously way.",I.,1
321175.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products much better than they really are except tobacco and medicine advertisements. In tobacco advertisements, they always express bad images of tobacco. Outside the package of tobacco, they write about concern about cancer with tobacco. In the advertisements for tobacco, we can see bad images of tobacco, but many smokers don't stop smoking in spite of these advertisements. My friends watch these advertisements for tobacco everyday, but keep smoking. The advertisements for medicine have a restriction, so a medicine company can't use an expression which tells more effects than it really are. But about other products besides tobacco and medicine, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the TV commercials, beautiful women and handsome men use these products in sophisticated places happily. And also we can listen to fun commercial music which makes the images of these products better. Sometimes famous movie stars appear in the commercials and tell us how these products are great and useful. There TV commercials are broadcast on TV several times a day, and finally we remember the names of these products unconsciously. Advertising companies try to make commercials which impress good and strong images of these products to customers. In Japan, commercials with comedy touch are fashionable. In these advertisements , famous comedians say funny words to impress the product customers during the commercials Customers unconsciously remember the funny words.",Children tell the funny word in their school and laugh with friends.,1
1741422.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops. Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body. They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool. And so do their friends. Concluding my essay I would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even 'most' as is written in the statement. It would be unfair to declare advertisements to be generally false, dishonest or dangerous.",There definitely are advertisements which state the truth about their product! Many adversitements even show a horrible content and can be really amusing.,1
98215.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I do not agree with this statement. I think there are a lot of young people that help his community and spend a lot of their time on it. For example there are some volunteers in many places: in hospitals, in centers for old people. and so on. I know some people who work for the ambulance: they are volunteers who stay, some times also all night, at the ambulance to give their help in case of need, and the day after they are in office to work. There are also some girls I know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they seek or need help. These girls have a big sense of responsibility for helping others, I think. Moreover, my cousin is always around the community of her church (she is very religious) to give her help to guide and educate children. In her blood and heart there is the force to do this. She tells me she feels much better when she helps the neighbours. I talked about some people I know, but I didn ` t say anything about myself.

965186.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years. One reason is the oil is limited and it gets less and less recently. And the now energy such as sunshine is not able to take the part of oil. We may have a lot of difficulty solving the energy problem. After twenty years oil could not be enough to apply to all the cars we have, so apart from people having to choose another way for traffic. Or more people choose the electric train to go to work or study. Another reason for this is that people could not have to be in the office to work in the future. Now more and more people choose the way to at home. The internet is changing our world, we can have a meeting on the internet easily and make a report and send it to the office by mail. because of this a lot of people don't need to drive to the office every day and even some people don't need a car at home. The traffic has not stopped changing its style in history.",We can imagine that may be in the future people will find some more useful ways for traffic such as personal planes.,1

As time is changing may be the automobile company will have new options for the buyers. I partially agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. because india is still a developing country. those who have developed successfully might have options. india has to raise its economy. there are people still staying on the foot path. according to me yes may be we wont be able to see small cars like santro,zen etc during that time The indian economy would definitely have raised people instead of using small cars would prefer to use big cars like benz or posh. nowa days we see an increasing rate of petrol and diesel use. people find it difficult to travel by autorishaws and cabs mainly because of heavy traffic and very important things the attitude of the driver makes it easy for them to have the habit of sayingno. but if one has his own conveyance he/she may travel easily. but yes as i said earlier, India will be developed in the near future. where there are possibilities of having one's own customized plane or other facility. Nowadays, the price of airline tickets has gone down. its become cheaper and now a days there are many flights going daily internationally as well as domestically. recently i visited madras my family preferred going by plane because it saves time and there was hardly any difference in the cost. now a days only people do not have time for their personal comments and that men are replaced by machinery.",may be twenty years down the line robbers and other machinery will replace man.,1

Indeed, a person who has different skills can easily understand different points of view in a company. This understanding is really necessary for people who are managers. He has to manage people, suppliers, to understand consumers, to take decisions for his company. For example he has to take financial decisions which are really important in a company if he does not take into account all the advantages or drawbacks of his decisions. The survey of the company could be in danger.

First,it is very dangerous if one travels alone. When we travel to a new place,we do not know a lot about it. We will have plenty of problems. For example ,we may get lost in the new place;we may not find the right place to have meals and sleep after the whole tiring day. The first day of our trip will be full of finding ,boring and tired. Also,because if we travelled in a group,we could make a lot of new friends. I like to be with other people. It will not make me feel frightened and alone.

Recent activities such as new programs which aim to encourage people to use their creativity in the projects. Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result.

I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities. We know that it could be important even for our own future, but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away. we try to keep every thought, every occasion, every second that is going away. and we are not able to stop and think about so important things. We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world. because change happens. but the problem is: will it be better? we don't know. but we will think that we were happy when we were young. because we lived every moment with an excessive intensity! i want to demonstrate what i meant to say. there are about eighty words left. if i had wanted to think i could have written a lot of other things. but now i'm thinking that i'm tired and my lovely friend is downstairs.",She's waiting for me and i want to go there.,1
266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world. As one man, if you have agood advertisement about your product, you will have agood idea around the world. Beacuse T. V can show your advertisements to be good.",Also the TV can give your country agood background around the world.,1

For the following reasons, however, I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. First, older people have more free time. For example, older people can retire from their job when the people have got enough money to spend their least life. Many older people can spend both money and time on what they want to do.

Once you are on the way, you'll never know what will happen or who you will meet. Every experience will be like a surprising gift and every friend will be your valuable fortune in your life. The best thing to explore the world on your own is to create memories by yourself. Some people would think it's convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spots right away. That way, you don't have to waste too much time finding places. And even the tour guide could explain the information or historic stories to let you know without a book. Actually, the tour guide nowadays only shows the travelers to the spots where they can make money.

They do not worry, if they can help an old lady to cross the street. Focusing on their own aims is very important. In addition they only live, because they want to enjoy their lives. They do not look for people, who need help. I think, that young people should be asked or even forced, if they do not want to help other people. On the whole most young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Working in a hospital for a low price can help to remind people, especially young people, that they will become older.","For sure, they are forced to see a lot of diseases, for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness.",1
1959261.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits. I have more positive experiences of travelling with a group than travelling alone. So i like to travel with groups led by a tour guide. Travel with a group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensive. Usually for group travel , one will take care of the ticketbooking, hotel reservation etc. The group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay. So i don't need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress. Last year,I visited India with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free. My group leader organized travel and reservations and my tour guide took me to all the important places. The guide will take the group and show everything that the group needs to see in that area. In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for the next day's events. This is so time saving. This way, i can concentrate on other things like enjoying my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meeting new friends at the party etc.",Group travel is safer.,1

I believe that I can state this position through presenting the career of some of my friends. Observing their works and characteristics, most of them are challengers, who always like to try different things from others and like to invent something new that no one has ever thought of. If they believe that one project that has been planned very well based on their planned strategy through their experiences and collaborations co-works, they are not afraid of taking risks of loosing their fonds. I have a friend that has been working for the health sector which specializes in HIV/AIDS for many years in the world. I would like to say that she is a sufficiently successful person, considerate in her profession and her economic status that can live on her own.

In life we need to enjoy every part, though it is related to money, adventure, drama etc. Elders are always frightened as they always think of the future rather than the present. But youngsters are really bothered about the future. For example when i am at school i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me, but finally they sent me with more caution. After comming back, they saw my video of my bangee jump on tour and started scolding me though i safely came back. They are always more curious in life and they never try for any adventure. I feel adventure is also part of enjoyment. Spending money is economy for elderly people but for young people money doesnt matter for enjoyment. when i started earning, i started spending for my own expenses, like restaurants, outings with friends, enjoying weekends, but my parents did nt like this as they wanted me to save money for my future. I feel that we need to enjoy it when we have the opportunity, as time never comes back.

When a student has understood a certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself. By understanding it the student will be able to answer any type of question on that topic. For example let us consider that a student is studyingmotor. The student needs to understand the main idea and what the concepts are that are related to that topic. And how the motor works and many more things about the motor. But,less importance should be given to learning facts. Let us consider another example, let us consider one of the topic from the student subjects. The student must know what is the main idea and the concepts of that particular topic rather than learn facts on that particular topic.

1856265.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well. That means that it is so competitive in that area. If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others, it is rare to achieve success.

478851.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do. If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first. People need to try new things. Furthermore,in schools. Teachers ask questions of their students. Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question. Even if the solution that the student did is wrong,this is the best way of learning the right thing for students. Especially in Mathematics classes. Even though I was not sure about the solution,I always wanted to try to solve it and I was always the volunteer. Last but not least,the way which goes to succeed is not always clear,there are often difficulties. For example,someone wants to study abroad,brings everything in his back and goes to the country where he will study. In this situation,he takes a risk of losing all his relationships with friends and even with his family. Moreover,he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country.","If he needs help,then there is nobody at the first times when he goes to this country.",1

There are millions of kinds of advertisements on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, or even mails. These various pictures and commits of the products seem much better than they really are.

I thought that it was totally ridiculous and I paid money in vain. We couldn't even enjoy things that we could have. It is not a good memory for me but a worthless exhausting trip. There is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, It just gets rid of my interests in the touring places. A tour guide tells us everything, and we should go to places only where the tour guide leads us. There can be many things that I am going to get interested in that the tour guide is going to miss out on.

Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more.",Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future.,1

Turning to the statements that should be claimed, one informative example is doctors, having a complete knowledge of all the academic subjects such as anatomy and many more , will improve the jr. docters to perform the operation on the human bodies, because all the people going to the doctor will have complete credibility on them that the doctors cure their illness , there is no exaggeration that if the anesthesiologist performs an eye operation he will be perfectly perfect in all the organs functioning such as brain, nerves etc. so a doctor should be well practiced with his academic subjects. Another informative example is in the engineering section where, the students learn in the first two years the concepts of the few subjects will be help full them in their final semester , such as material and energy balance will help full them to apply in their transport phenomena subjects, such that all the basic principles from one subject will be related to other subjects.","So, it will be like this , aperson goes to a TV shop to buy a tv , the shopkeeper tells about the TYPES OF TV's present in his shops.",1

People want to get more things from life. People use a lot of ideas to create the things that they want. However, we know most adversisements make products seem much better than they really are. Many companies have made many DM and advertisements to attract their customers. For the company, they just want people to buy their products. The advertisements are just a way to present their thoughts. However, the real product is not really like the advertisement. The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thoughts to their customers. Maybe they did not talk about how to use the products any more. They want the climents to keep their eyes on them. That is business. On the other hand, now there are many companies that sell their stuff in the TV show. They provide the time to use their products. If the customer does like the products that they can return to the company. From this time, the company really hope their customers know and to use their products. They not only just want to sell their stuff and they hope to understand what the customers want and what they need. The advertisements are just a way to express what they company what to say to the customer.",The advertisements can not be the real products.,1

As time is changing may be the automobile company will have new options for the buyers. I partially agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. because india is still a developing country. those who have developed successfully might have options. india has to raise its economy. there are people still staying on the foot path. according to me yes may be we wont be able to see small cars like santro,zen etc during that time The indian economy would definitely have raised people instead of using small cars would prefer to use big cars like benz or posh. nowa days we see an increasing rate of petrol and diesel use. people find it difficult to travel by autorishaws and cabs mainly because of heavy traffic and very important things the attitude of the driver makes it easy for them to have the habit of sayingno. but if one has his own conveyance he/she may travel easily. but yes as i said earlier, India will be developed in the near future. where there are possibilities of having one's own customized plane or other facility.

1729734.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I totally agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well. The most important thing in life is improving and challenging yourself and it helps the person to succeed in the future. Eventhough it involves high risk , you really should try it. To improve your skills, career, and knowledge, you have to challenge yourself. The most successful people are the people who do not fear failing. The person who fears failing can not challenge new things. I was that kind of person when i came to America. I did not try or challenge new things. I did not speak English at all because i was afraid of failing and someone might laugh at my poor English. After a few months, i realized i was wrong. In fact, although i live in America, my english has not improved at all. I started trying to adopt a new culture and I recognized how wonderful English is. I am sure that trying new things is tough and it needs more power, but it will affect the person's life. I believe that trying new things is worth taking high risks.",Think about food companies.,1
1494797.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I really hope that in a few years the number of cars goes down! Today the cars in our cities are too much:our air is dramatically polluted and this is because of the cars;there is also a lot of traffic and sometimes you take one hour to go only one side of your city. I think that today all people and governments have understood that the problem is big and important:probably in the next few years they are going to approve some policies in order to reduce the number of cars and to offer some substitutive service or to improve the ones that exist. I'm speaking about buses,for short or medium travels, and trains. I think that the government and the citizens of all the world have to cry to obtain this. I think that petrol companies and car industries that probably want the number of cars to increase in the next day can' t be heard by the government because the most important things are our wealth and quality of life. For a family of four, it is quite normal to have two or three cars today. I think this is very dangerous for our society. If there are a lot of cars the problem is first of all the pollution,that i think is drammatically important and is a necessary solution very soon. Other problems are the traffic and the parking. For all these reasons i think that there will not be fewer cars in use in the next few years because it is really dangerous for the population. If the number of cars increased i would be very worried and i think we would have a lot of problems because of our wealth.","So i hope that the universe is not so stupid as to look more at possessions, like cars, than at wealth.",1

The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children. Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study.

I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities. Probably our education makes us find satisfaction in other aspects of life. The style of life is completely different from the past. We spend all day listening to music, watching television, going around with our friends, studying. and so we have no time to think about our communities. We know that it could be important even for our own future, but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away. we try to keep every thought, every occasion, every second that is going away. and we are not able to stop and think about so important things. We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world. because change happens. but the problem is: will it be better? we don't know. but we will think that we were happy when we were young. because we lived every moment with an excessive intensity! i want to demonstrate what i meant to say. there are about eighty words left. if i had wanted to think i could have written a lot of other things.",but now i'm thinking that i'm tired and my lovely friend is downstairs.,1

However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons. First of all, most students learn a lot of subjects in school and have exams in each semester. However, it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part. For example, I learned many subjects from academic institutions such as history, nuclear  physics, and pantam physics. But i am the president of an online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me. Second, people can learn from their peers and family about something like history, music or art.",Most sportsmen who play in Major League Baseball in the United States and Premier League Soccer in the U.,1

Here are my reasons. First, if one person doesn't want to give enough time to help other people that means he is selfish. I joined an interview process and new hired people training at my company. In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help. Once I worked for a local campaign , but I always helped people and did some volunteer work for a patient group. Till I want to work at a Global company. Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company.

They are freer than before, they have more rights: politically, the individual aspect is more developed in this generation than in previous generations can we say young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities? I disagree with this statement because I think young people are under the influence of globalisation. I think we cant say young people dont give enough time to helping their communities since young people are working for global problems like individual rights of all people in the world, human rights, environmental problems or food supply like in African countries so the concept of their country disappears and young people are thinking of a global viewpoint. Another reason for my dissatisfaction is that young people are first educated in their countries. Later they are working in their countries with their colleagues. This is the beginning of their professional life starts in their home country and then later, most of them start to work for international companies which are the result of theglobal economy. I mean you first spend all your time in your country and then try to develop and improve the standard of living of all people in the world economically or socially. people prefer to work in the worldwhere they are their home country.

They want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product. Advertisements should not only emphasize the goodness of their product, furthermore they stress a character given by the advertisement. For example, when there is a company advertising entertaining things like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisement during the commercial breaks. It is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisement is correct or not, the only important thing is that they get the people's attention and may achieve interest in watching their show.

1955440.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. To sell a product, it has to have good promotion, advertisements sell the product because while showing the promotion of the product, the y are showing the best product ever, when sometimes it's just a big lie and sometimes it's the truth. The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market. There is a background behind a product, and belonging to a company. The product that is already on sale has an enormous study before getting to the store. Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time they pass through, by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about. The best way to sell could be by improving your product just by very tiny changes like making the product wantable, but not changing the product, just making people interested, curious and this will make people buy the product, this is a great way of doing a sell.

According to my knowledge I believe every school has the same amount of time to do volunteerwork. Our school has to do more than 20 hours of volunteer work for 3 years of junior-high school.

141650.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it depends on the age of the student. For young students, like secondary and high school it will be more important to know about ideas and concepts. Students at this age are still at the beginning stage or we can say learning state. They will learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future. They may even learn from what is happening in history. By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results. This will be a worthwhile experience for students For example, they are two kinds of cost in production, fixed and variable cost. Fix cost should not be changed at any sum of productions. But when we increase or quantity any certain level, the fixed cost will change. Thus, ideas or concepts and facts support each other. Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts. Because some of the facts may come from ideas or concepts.",The plane that can fly is a fact.,1

Or, should we stick to what we know how to do best? Don't we have an intrinsic curiosity? So, what makes us frightened to try new things or should we be brave enough to choose not to do what we already know best? Could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing? As a successful commander Sir Winston Churchill has a saying: ""The first of all values of man is courage"". I agree that in order to be successful people should be brave and try new things. Let us first look at the history and pick up Mr. Edison. He invented the lamb after trying 2000 different ways leading him to disappointment. He tried ""2000 new things"" and came up with the lamb. Likewise, we can consider Darwin and his theory against creavitism. Besides, being historically proved our intrinsic cruveness always leads us to try new things.

88199.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays most young people care a lot about their own problems. They do not worry, if they can help an old lady to cross the street. Focusing on their own aims is very important. In addition they only live, because they want to enjoy their lives. They do not look for people, who need help. I think, that young people should be asked or even forced, if they do not want to help other people. On the whole most young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Working in a hospital for a low price can help to remind people, especially young people, that they will become older. For sure, they are forced to see a lot of diseases, for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness. This experience can help to persuade younger people to spend more time helping their communities, especially their own one. Young people can change their minds, because they see, that it makes older people very happy, that there is somebody, who visits them. Secondly parents have got less time, because they have to cook for their children , do the whole housework and they also have to earn the money.

1737605.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some say it does not. In my opinion, however, young people enjoy life rather than older people do because, they are impulsive, energetic, and creative. Firstly, it is generally accepted that young people are more impulsive than old people. Therefore, young people usually do things without certain plans. For example, in my personal experience, I have been on a trip without any plans with my friends. One day, one of my friends suddenly suggested going on a trip and we just agreed to go on a trip that day, because we were young and impulsive. Secondly, it is normally accepted that young people are more energetic than old people. In fact, it is hard to enjoy life such as going on a trip or going on a picnic for old people because they are less energetic. However, young people are always energetic in general. Therefore, it can be described as one reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Lastly, it seems clear that young people are more creative than old people. They always bring something new and creative and move into action. It is one of the ways that they enjoy their life creatively.","Moreover, in my personal experience, one day, I and my friend were thinking about making fake IDs.",1

As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other.

Aren't you aware of the severe air pollution problem? Don't you get embarrassed when passing at a speed of 10km/h in crowded crowded area? In twenty years, fewer cars will be in use than now. Actually, i used to dream of these kinds of cases when I was involved in environmental friendly social services. Our goals were to advertise the air pollution of cars and encouraging people to use public transport. By that time, I sometimes had that feeling one day, cars should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly. Likewise, the place i'm living now Singapore is a very country which has succeeded in reducing the number of cars. The high taxes included in the purchase disgust the buyers' taste for getting a new car. Not only the tax included in the buying process but taxes such as ERP, those which are paid when cars are passing the city area, are having great success in making people use fewer cars.

This car has been put on Ebay as an 'on sale' item and the price predicted was about 4000 millions US $. It also included that this kind of car will perhaps be more popular in about 20 years, and in the time 20 years pass, I think scientists and engineers will be able to find a new kind of sources as a replacement for fuel.

1513527.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Some people say that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies. Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as the Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of the computer all day and play games. They believe computers bring more fun into their life.",Some young people just like to go shopping.,1

In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very well known , it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction than everybody else does. Take for example the case of  the'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called the successful person even though he is not present, just because he did something different and tried a new thing that is the reason Reliance is so popular today.","The new care taker of the Reliance company is the son of its founder, so we cannot call them equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his business.",1

On the other hand, when a person tries new things, it is not sure that what he is doing is going to be the right choice, and in many cases he fails and, sometimes, he loses everything he has already reached with fatigue. I think that a person has to go on and, maybe, could become important, famous or rich, only taking risks: if someone chooses to continue doing what he already knows how to do well, certainly will not make a mistake or big error, but it will rest on the common person for all his life, asking himself what could happen to him if he had chosen the more difficult way.

So the analysis of the different conditions will be treated in the first and second part and i will state about the statement about whether or not successful people are likely to do what they know or are more likely to try new things I-Why they wont try news things a-threat If somebody made his way to the top , sometimes ,he would be afraid of trying something news because of the treatment to fall and then lose every thing that he had. b-nothing more to prove When someone achieves a goal it is not rare that he thinks that he has nothing else to prove. II-Why they are willing to try new things a-not enough Sometimes the things that they get are just not enough and they want more , think about an old boxer who wanted one more thrill by fighting a fighter. B-because they can do it At the beginning they did nt have a lot of means to fulfil their dreams but now they are famous they can invest money in order to be happy III- thrill or calm ? i think that whether or not a successful person will try something new or not is related to his state of mind, there are not such things as laws which tell him what he has to do.

But some advertisements seem the most time much better than they really are. In my opinion, i agree with this statement for these two reasons:the use of very good commercials and also the use of celebrities in the commercial. First of all , many advertisements have really good commercials which can convince people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of those commercials which want to sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as they get this product they might looklike this person. For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight. Secondly, there is a huge use of celebrities in the advertisements that gives a false image of what a product really is.

We live our lives to our fullest when we are young, leaving behind the worries and the intricacies of old age. So i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energetic, with young minds fresh from college, with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out. ""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better than younger people. But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world. The older people have minds that are worn out, by age , by time. Whereas a younger mind has a lot of ideas to offer. These are fresh brains, that have come right from college, filled with all sorts of new tools and the vigour to put those tools to action. And also there is no burden of a family to support. A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife, his children, his home. , this list can go endless.","Above all the dating of girls , gives you such  a divine feeling that can hardly be expressed by words.",1
253215.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"During life there are different periods and ages which each of them improve wider differences. The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children. Our enjoyment is exploring the world which is around us. We could enjoy things with Tyni. But the fears are the biggest in our life, the unknown things making us frezze. In this period we do not worry about studying, working or earning money. It is funny. I agree that it is the best age for enjoying  yourself. The adolescents usually enjoy launching at the adventure. They do not take safe measures. The tool for enjoying is to be reborn. Their worries are their appearance and how good they look. The headache is the study. They are not afraid of troublesome things they feel that they can manage the whole world. They have not always been accepted in society for being problematic and for driving crazy at their parents. They are noisy people. In the end for adults used to be totallydifferent. They get enjoyment by other ways. Spend time with the family, go on a quiet vacation, read a good book, go to an orchestral concert, work at home, do the house work, are some of the activities which adults prefer to enjoy themselves. While the young people dance in a noisy disco they have a coffee with some old friends. I think that each individual enjoys it in the best way for him. It is no matter what we do for getting. The time is short. We must spend it being happy and making people happy. it is fun to do it.",The creation of good is the ca.,1
237139.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I agree with the statement because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts. The first factor is age at this age as a student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are the first step for a student. At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts. Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts. Any student who is getting older can learn from his past about the facts. For example consider a 10th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world. So it is better for him to concentrate on his studies then to know about the facts. Third is it's the time for students to improve their skills in their studies because if they improve their skills in it then they automatically learn about the facts in it. For example consider a student who is studying for the 12th standard he learns from his past life the facts in it. as he growsup he knows more about the facts so it is better for students to concentrate on understanding the ideas and the concepts. Fourth at the student's age knowing about the facts can cause problems.,For example it is not correct for primary students to know about sex in their childhood it tends to thelife of that student.,1

It is important, that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding, but mainly these dates and names can be researched in a book, or on the internet at almost any time. Although, some very important key facts must be memorized. When I was in a conversation with an American visitor in Genova, standing in front of the Columbus museum, I could not remember, when America was discovered. A such an important date is known by any second grade child However, I could not remember the year. He reminded me, that America was discovered in 1492. I felt very bad at that time that I would never forget this important fact in my life. However, I am convinced, that ideas and concepts are much more important than learning facts. Concepts are more likely to be necessary in daily life, than are facts. What I mean is, if there were two or more countries combating each other, it would be war. From school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times, that in all wars many people were killed, and in most of those lands and people changed nationality once the war was over.",During the war many people were killed and tortured.,1
1053764.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays young people don't spend their time helping their communities. In my opinion young people should be more involved in their communities. Young people should deal with the problems of their communities. Nevertheless, young people have to deal with many problems related to their life. As a consequence, they don't have time to help their communities. On the one hand, I believe that young people should try to eliminate the negative aspects of their society. On the other hand, I think that the communities must understand the young people's problems and try to solve them.",Young people have a lot of problems during their life.,1
718165.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"We all hope that we want to enjoy our lives. Then this question comes to my mind, which enjoy life more, young people or older people? I think young people enjoy life more than older people. There are three reasons. First, young people have healthier bodies than older people do. Second, they have a longer time in the rest of their lives than older people do. Third, older people tend to say that the younger the better. First of all, young people have a healthier and stronger body than older people do. They can continue to work longer, run faster, need shorter time to sleep, and so on than old people do. That means young people can enjoy what old people can not do. For example, they can swim in the morning, go out for lunch, go shopping, and have a party with their friends. Second, they have a longer time remaining in their lives than old people do. If you want to be a very good and famous doctor, it will take about ten years to attend medical school and get enough experience as a doctor. Young people can plan and achieve this aim because they have time. However, old people may not be because they only have limited time in the rest of their lives. Finally, I often hear old people say that the younger the better.",I am still young and can only imagine the lives of old people.,1

'The young generation is trained to serve the community in one way or the other. This prompts me to strongly disagree with the notion that young people today donot give enough time to helping their communities. Most of the educational dance dramas , the non-government organisations involve the young generation. They are more energetic and enterprising in solving community problems. Starting from school days, children are taught to help older people to keep their environment clean. Many schools even include this as a part of their extra-curricular activities. For instance one of the schools in my locality graded students even on the way they rendered their services tosociety. Further, teenagers and college going students inspite of having a busy schedule and overburden of studies take time to interact with people living in old age homes , in the nearby villages ,in a nearby blind school or in the sweepers colony just next door. They acquaint themselves with the subtle problems faced by them and guide them to get a solution at their level. There are many Non - governmental organisations of which the Younger generations form a bulk(the working force ) like the Sanskar Bharti in India which serves the community through Indian art and culture which is unknown to many here. In contrast to this I agree that there is a smaller lot of younger generation which has a hedonistic attitude towards life. But that can not outcast the services given by the greater lot which think about the community as well. Thus I conclude that the younger generation is prepared to take the responsibility of Serving the society guide by the motto service before self.",it is.,1

This is mainly because of the new technologies that existed at this time. The development in the way of living, getting good name with in the short period of time, living in good hygenic conditions, improved transportation helped the young generations to live comfortably. I agree that younger generations are enjoying more compared to that of older generations. In recent days there has been greater impact in a variety of fields. one example is improvement in information technology. This improvement helped the younger generations to get good jobs and higher salaries. Due to this they live in good apartments , have a car and live comfortably. The second example is improvement in medical care. In the olden days people had to suffer a lot due to lack of good doctors and hospitals.

Most of them are giving service for very different types of consumers in so many different ways. In order to reach them they must emphasise that they exist and be recognized by the clients. From the very beginning of life and also today way of doing this thing is advertising. Although the advertisement is a crucial thing, most of them make products seem much better than they are. First of all, the function of the advertisement is also to advertise the product i. d. it must give reasons to the consumers in order for them to buy that product. While they are doing this they are trying to pass their rivals, so they do unpleasant things to achieve their goals. So, the advertisements would give us some information about the product that is incorrect. However, what is next?

1961659.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Helping our community is very important. Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities, but it's not very often. I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time on their communities is the school rules. In high school and college they have a kind of rule -like homework- that a student has to help his or her community at list 10 hoursper year. We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. The second reason is that commissars are in need of helpers.

1136310.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many different subjects is better than only one specific subject. Nowadays, there is too much knowledge to learn. Everyday we can get new information from the internet, books, newspapers, and TVs. First, I think every subject is important to us. Some people think that only high-technology is the most important thing in our society. Because of the great improvement in technology we have a convenient life. But it doesn't mean other subjects are worth nothing. Good society needs good policy and it relates to many many different subjects like economy, history and so on. Second, since we can get so much information everyday, we should tell which is right and which is wrong, which is truth and which is fake. In order for us to tell from right to wrong we should have some basic knowledge. We should have broad basic knowledge of different kinds of field. Third, even when talking about high-tech we should learn knowledge from many different kinds of field and combine it together. Only if we combine different kinds of knowledge can we turn our technique into an application. Many new industries combine two or even more fields. Bio and electronics, Bio and MEMs, Bio and nanotechnology are all the new trend in the future.

1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate. I reason when people hear about a product they should research on the internet or something like that. It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already. Maybe they can get more than money. I think most of the advertisement lies because my mother always says this one, ""if your merchants are good you do not have to call somebody to come around you and take my product. If you are good already all the people who take your product you do not have to sell yourself as much as possible"".",In the end I want to say something If you go down in the see you have to scream because you havefailed.,1
1273655.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When I was a lazy student, I always tried to make out why my teacher insisted on teaching these ideas and concepts. Now I have grown up and got the main idea step by step. Concepts and ideas must be learned clearly to predict the facts. First of all I totally agree with this situation. Not being able to understand ideas and concepts and then predicting or learning facts means wanting to run not being able to learn how to walk. For example there are two students in the same class. They are good friends there. Student A tries to understand basic things and after all the notion. He wants to be the top in class. But Student B just tries to understand cause and effect. His aim is to get enough marks in class. Do you ever wonder why teachers try to teach notions. I did, the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger. I mean their aims are not just to get the highest marks. When students learn ideas, concepts etc. he/she can develop that subject. He/she really should be the competent of this subject. In addition, a student who wants to be an engineer, he/she has to learn all about the subject if s/he really creates a unique thing or innovation. To sum up, you have to make our way between these Student A and B.","Which one do you want to be? Just get enough marks in the exam, and make your GDP 2.",1
796117.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements are one of the most important ways for companies to improve their profits, and to sell more and more products. irrelevant if it's TV advertising or radio, or the Internet, it must be interesting and remarkable for the audience in order to do his job. Unfortunately some companies go too far and make their products appear much better than they really are, which makes the consumer upset after he buys the product. I still remember many toys and devices i bought when i was young, actually i forced my parents to buy them, because they were really amazing on the screen, but i was really shocked, because they were different from what i've seen in the advertisement. Why do they do that? I think because of the strong competition with the other companies, they have no choice. They must make their product look perfect as much as they can, otherwise, no one will buy it, especially with the kids stuff. The child doesn't have the ability to analyse the advertisement and figure out if it's real or not, unlike the mature. I think the companies found themselves in this situation, and they can hardly change it, for simple reasons.","The customer doesn't help them to change it! Imagine your self watching a respectable advertisement, showing the advantages and the disadvantages of the product, will you be interested in it? or will you think this way: if they couldn't hide the disadvantages in the advertisement they made by themselves, how can i trust their product?

Ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete. Concepts can be altered , modified or even proven to be false. A fact would be, what goes up must come down. That is a proven fact. No matter where you are on earth, whatever is launched up into the air does not matter how high, it will eventually come crashing down back to earth due to the gravitational pull.

Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other.

To achieve this there are no secret formulas, there are no new things to try, nothing like that, but doing what must be done, and what has been done since the early years of this sport, working for it. Also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind ""if it is working and giving you results do not change or try something new"", successful tennis players do not take great risks, nor try new things, they just do what they know they do best, and stick to it if it is working.","So this makes me think things should work like this in every other subject, if something is giving you success, why change it?

Today young people, with the conscience of this reality, think about the most effective ways to use their time. Money as the root of all evil pushes today ` s young people to research for the ways of self-masturbation but not the communities`. The most important fact that can not be denied is that humanity is in the middle of a technological transition. Among this transition, every new gadget attracts their attention. A new mp3 player, a new CPU with four chipsets or a new software that allows using the same desktop; they are stuck in the dream of what is going to come next. Because of this kind of innovation, they begin to think in micro instead of macro and they become isolated from their community. This isolation causes to become antisocial and ends by becoming self- centred. When they need help with their own problems, they just have to browse on some online forums and get the answer they need. However, this generalization would not be all accurate. There also exist some situations when young people help their communities such as teaching English language and computer utilization to homeless children, organizing visits to old people, cleaning the streets of the hood they live in, preparing theatrical sketches and concerts with the goal of a more computergathering. All in all, I do completely agree with the statement because young people nowadays are totally busy because of the obligation of self-improvement.

That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist.

The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market. There is a background behind a product, and belonging to a company. The product that is already on sale has an enormous study before getting to the store.

1530737.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"First of all, I totally disagree with the following statement. And the reasons follow. One, from my personal experience, traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by yourself. Because the travel company which the guide is affiliated with always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights. In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took.","Two, traveling in a group may be safe sometimes.",0

208569.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Whether to travel by forming a group or individually has been controversial among many people. However, I basically disagree with the position that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. I have two reasons for my claim. It prevents people from enjoying their personal privacy and enables them to visit only limited places. Most of all, peoplehardly like to enjoy their privacy once they have had a trip by joining a group. As a matter of fact, participating in a package travel needs people to organize it altogether and it is always necessary to have cooperation with strangers. Besides, people are even required to eat their meals at the same places and at the same time. Thus, there is no private time available to enjoy themselves such as walking on the beaches and having some relaxation when they wish to. As a result, traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite disappointed. In addition, it is hard to travel around some places where they want to. Generally, the trip's schedule has already been planned by a tour guide which makes it difficult for people to visit their own desirable places where they always dreamt about. In contrast, by travelling around some countries alone, it will allow people to walk around places and take some photographs and enjoy their holidays. Accordingly, going on a trip individually will be beneficial for people to access diverse places.","To sum up, everyone has different opinions on this issue.",0
1586422.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I completely agree with this statement. The main reason for advertising is to sell their product on the market. They want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product. Advertisements should not only emphasize the goodness of their product, furthermore they stress a character given by the advertisement. For example, when there is a company advertising entertaining things like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisement during the commercial breaks. It is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisement is correct or not, the only important thing is that they get the people's attention and may achieve interest in watching their show. The only thing advertising does is because of money. Money rules the world. And so the company is not afraid to deceive people. Next to the obvious reason that the company wants people to buy their products first of all, is that maybe their product is not so good that people would buy it. In turn, they have to improve the image or quality of their product. This makes a product seem better although it might be worse. On the other hand lots of people have already had a lot of experiences with some advertisements and their promises years ago. Moreover, they got to know that most of the advertising is much better than the product in reality. This experience made people more sceptical. But how should people know if the advertised product is worse than the advertisement promised or if it is maybe exactly like that or even better? They have to test it.",And therefore they spend some money.,0

114142.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics call I will use the concepts and ideas to get to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts there will be times when they will not help get the solution. In our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very basic example, If my parents want me to go buy vegetables from the vegetable market I will decide which way will be the easier road. I will answer by asking myself using my concepts and not going with the facts. Our human mind can take only some facts and then we have to use the concepts to work towards success.",There are many facts in this world and it will not be in our human abilities to know all the facts.,0
1187884.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think that those people that try new things and take risks have more success than those that only do what they already know how to do well. One of the many reasons is that people try new things in their lives because they are looking at how to be altruist and how to be successful. For instance, if I want to be a competitive person sending cars, I need to have many ideas in order to create new models and new types, more strongs, more sures, cheaper and nicer. I have to try many risks during the elaboration of these cars, I have to risk a lot of money on employers that they be more prepared and I must give them all the necessary resources that the government's law requires.

1423696.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the given statement because i think it depends on the individual and not on the time available. A person who really wants to help his community can surely take time for the same whereas a person who is not that interested will use his time for other purposes rather than serving his community. No doubt, in the present generation the competition has increased and inorder to lead a really good life people really need to work hard. So in running after making a penny people overlook the need to spare time for working for the community. But still its not true that people dont give enough timefor thecommunity. For example, recently mumbai encountered a bomblast where thousands of people were injured. Then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospitals and getting their treatment done. A group of students took shifts for the whole night and served the injured with bread and tea. I think this shows the concern left in people.

Life goes fast and we want to pursue and achieve our plans because today everything is planned per advance and there is no time for civic behaviour. In addition, globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identificationproblem: which communities are for which people? Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fights between them. So, there is no unity in this world why would young people change this by helping who and with which means? Modern life makes young people very narcissistic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be useful. Some will help the oldest and disabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them. Others will come into an association to create a better life place for their community.

127102.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"While we are studying it is good to know what I should learn. Should I keep working on a subject that I already master or should I develop a wildspread culture ? On the one hand, I could specialize in order to become one of the best at what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another subject, while on the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill. A lot of scientific development wouldn't have happened if scientists just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improved the way he viewed physics, he wouldn't have been able to develop his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics. Usually great intellectuals have a broad knowledge that gives them a new way of seeing their specific subject. So in many ways both assertions are complementary. Personally I am a very curious person. For me all knowledge is good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity. Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I can only understand. For this reason I believe that it is ""better"" to have broad knowledge. It is more social. However our social environment and our society enhance experts.","If you want to be hired by a company, whatever you are doing, you need to be good at it.",0
1599863.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place. Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there. They may lose their way, and be in trouble with the particular language and culture. For example, American children who go to Singapore receive a heavy punishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place.","If a tourist was along with them and taught them Singapore's rules, they wouldn't be in trouble there.",0

1469368.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Nowadays, oil becomes even rarer and even more expensive and some people believe that in thirty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. We will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future. On the one hand, petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable, for instance because they are in big cities. Moreover, governments are developing tubes, trains or buses to encourage people not to use their own car and to pollute less. For example, lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown on the tube in Paris. On the other hand, the population of Third-World countries is growing, and at the same time, lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering getting a car. Furthermore, lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent. For this reason, it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them up just every hour. Besides, scientists are considering developing cars with hybrid motors, which rely both on electricity and oil. It could be a very good solution to the cost of oil. For the moment, those cars are purchased above all in Japan but they may soon be sold all over the world. To put it in a nutshell, the issue of cars is rather an issue of oil supply.","Till hybrid cars are not very famous, the number of cars could hence decrease.",0
753065.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The speed of development concerned technique is so fast today, and more and more speculate about what will happen in 20 years. Some of them believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I am hesitant to agree with the statement, and the reasons are listed below. Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today. Moreover, I also believe that people in developed countries will not give up using cars; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience. For example, We can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them. Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather. And I am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being, cars will become more popular. Admittedly, Many people think that the number of cars will be decreasing, because they cause a great deal of pollution, and people nowadays pay special attention to the environment. Nevertheless, I deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finally varnished, with the development of techniques. And we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by the UN, that a car made with the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before. In conclusion, though the cars face the problem that they pollute a great deal today, I think the number will not be fewer, because more and more people can afford them, and such great comfort and convenience they offer, and, the most important.",the advantages of techniques.,0

First of all, living in Italy, I know that most of the young people in my country work or study not more than eight hours a day.","Other people, like Chinese people, work for at least 12 hours a day and they have not time to do other activities after they have finished studying or working.",0

I agree that younger generations are enjoying more compared to that of older generations. In recent days there has been greater impact in a variety of fields. one example is improvement in information technology. This improvement helped the younger generations to get good jobs and higher salaries. Due to this they live in good apartments , have a car and live comfortably. The second example is improvement in medical care. In the olden days people had to suffer a lot due to lack of good doctors and hospitals. They may die without knowing which disease caused them the death. In contrast improved hospitals having good doctors and equipment caused the people to suffer less with the diseases.

264742.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than specializing in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administrativeservices. I have even come across a few parents who give their children the liberty to choose their career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects.","In conclusion, I would like to express disagreement with a person who possesses broad knowledge of many academic subjects.",0

However, I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are a few specific reasons and examples to support my statement. First, ideas and concepts could be basic information of all theory or other  information. For example, facts are from the ideas and concepts. If there are not ideas and concepts, there also are not facts, all investigations have patterns or methods such a scientific method. First of all we think of ideas and concepts first. That is why I assert that all facts are made by lots of ideas and concepts. Second, People can nat critical thinking when they learn facts.

115526.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"As people grow older their interests may change. Whether young or old, each generation has their own amusement. However I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons. First of all, generally speaking, young people are less careful of their health than old people are. As people grow older the possibility that they will become sick willincrease. In hospital there are too many older people who consult a doctor for many reasons. As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the dearest thing of all. Secondly, young people do not have their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan for the future easily. Old people can not ever change their job or their partner in marriage. It makes the life of old people boring and less exciting. In addition to that old people have a heavy responsibility for their job and their family. In contrast, young people have a lot of time in the future; they can draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream. Finally young people, particularly young women can enjoy fashion and cosmetics. In the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women. This means that young people tend to enjoy a fashionable life and fashion brands target not old women but young women. Young women can spend more money than old women do because young women can use their money freely. And as people get older they get their weight more easily than they were young and they can not wear clothes that fit them when they were young.",Young people enjoy their life too.,0
1456863.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Although some people may think that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are, I totally agree that it helps the product to be sold out in the market with the result of the consumers' curiosity, if it is an advertisement made of/for women and if the advertisement is colourful enough. First of all, advertisements increase the curiosity of people especially if it is for women. Assume that a woman is watching the TV, who loves chocolate and sees the commercial on the television which has the mother seeing her son and her husband as a bar of chocolate and wanting to get a bite of them, the woman watching the commercial will be curious about the product and will give it a try. It is obvious that she won't be the only one so this will give a chance for that product to take place on the market shelf. It will be the consumers' decision to keep it there or ignore it on the next visit. The second thing is that women are the best customers in the world. It may not be the man who would like to give it a try if he sees the product right after he sees the advertisement but a woman can keep it in mind in the shopping list and that list appears when it comes to shopping and she picks up the product and gives it a try. For example, if it is a man who is in the market to get a pack of coffee he most likely picks up the package of coffee he is used to but if it is a woman she gets her regular coffee with the one she saw on the board on her way to the mall. The third one is colourful and well prepared advertisements.",A car you would never ask for may look like a Ferrari to you in a well prepared commercial and you may go ahead and see it in the store.,0

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world.

1299460.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like. Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound.","At this time, if the teacher uses a fact which is like putting the method into an experiment.",0

Some people think that to be a successful person , you need to try new things and take risks. Another group of people think that do the things they already know and try to do them as best as they can. Wow, these two ways seem that they work. What do you think? Now , I will tell you my opinion, I agree that success is to try new things and take risks. Well, I am not saying that you won't be a successful person if you just do what you already know and do it as well as you can. What i mean is ""improvement comes from trying"". We need to build up our own success we need to try to takerisks. OK, let's say you are in a football team you are the kicker.

You want, once the ball is in front of you, you can kick it in. Ok, finally you are the best kicker. But you forget something. The way you kick everyday is the old way. You did a wonderful job of kicking the football in the old way. But there are 1000 people in the world trying to find another better way to kick the football.

1054917.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject. Before applying students should take the following aspects into consideration. Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you have received the job you can still and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for. Secondly, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extent there is some truth in it, but, undoubtedly, experience shows that no matter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same. Nevertheless, doing a generalistical degree is in my opinion, better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time. In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only bespecified. And the time you have spent remains the same.","To summarize, students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they have obtained a degree in a specific subject.",0

So when we have to decide to study a special subject, we have to think about what is really interesting for us an d where are our potentials and resources. By paying attention to that we can focus on a subject we can make much better efforts at than others because of our talents and so on. This is positive for our self - esteem, because we know that we can do some things (it doesn`t have to be only one thing, but it can also not be everything) really good and that differs us from others in apositive way.

So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people.

1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate.

It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already.",Maybe they can get more than money.,0
1954279.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play. Young people are physically healthier and have more energy than older people. People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things. Experiencing convenient and fun things leads to people enjoying their life. For example, when people travel by car, young people may use a navigator in the car which helps them to travel far easily. They can find the location they want to see simply. However, old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators.",Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people.,0
1130325.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly believe the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

This type of skills will improve the ability to study and the ability to remember. These skills also reduce the study time. the students can learn more in a format quickly. Learning facts is good but every time we dont want to study. We dont want to sparemuch time on learningfacts. At that time these skills are very helpful. It is a very time consuming process. Understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful any time. for example i want to go to anexam ,first i will go through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and the concept of that one.

136505.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ignorance is far more important than knowing the facts. understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher. humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the facts from the early stone age we understand concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubbing two stones together thus understanding the process of combustionby using stones. we cant simply rely on the subject by knowing but for understanding it. for example every one knows about the law of conservation of energy,a person who understands applied in the form of electricity or mechanical engine. A student who got good marks in an examination ca not become a good engineer or doctor or infact, be good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good. Thus, application is important for a student who comes with an understanding of the subject.

So I agree that young people enjoy their life more than older people. We know that when we are young we enjoy our time playing , studying and doing alot of things we cannot donow. There are several reasons for that , one reason is that , when we were children we had the freedom to do any things we needed ,also we had the power to live a happy and interesting lifestyle , we could be late for hours. Moreover, we had the health and the desire to reach what we need , we could go for playing, singing with our friends , but when we get older we cannot do these things because we have new responsibilities in our life, such as our children and the care which they need to become like their parents. also , our power to enjoy our time became weak and we could not have the ability to work and enjoy ourselves, so we should let our children have this entertainment and let them live their life , because when we are our age we did alot of things which reminds me now. So you should live your life by having some exciting and enjoyment.","All in all , we cannot stop time , and we should convince ourselves in our destiny and fait , we must imagine our selves as we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our lives , and this will not prevent us from trying to complete our lives by thinking about the history which we have lived through from the young.",0

A group of people believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, because the MRT and public bus system will become more comfortable, and people will want to take the MRT or bus but not drive by themselves. We can see every modern city, like New York, Tokyo and Taipei, spend a lot of money to build a MRT system to reduce the amount of driving people. For this reason, this group of people also believe that the higher price of gas will stop people buying new cars but decide to take the public bus or MRT system.

429189.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The topic in disguise deals with, a person being generalist or a specialist. A generalist is a person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects. A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge of one subject. I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject. A person with broad knowledge in many subjects, a generalist, can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject. So he can deal with any of the subjects. Where as a person with deep knowledge about a single subject cannot deal with different subjects as he has no idea about other subjects. It is must to have knowledge of all the subjects to get through the exams and attain grades. Even in the case of getting a job, a generalist has more chances of getting a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal with any kind of subject that is given to him. Where as a specialist has to keep mum when asked about any other subject. The companies would definitely require a multi-talented person rather than a person who has great talent in a single subject. ""As every coin has two sides"". We cannot always say that having broad knowledge is vital. Hence there is a saying ""Jack of all trades but master of none"".

1818765.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible. It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius. To sum up, the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things. But its maybe the most important thing to realise that all human beings are different. As we all have different abilities and unabilities. The real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being taught.

1123424.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work. are shown. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you would rather pay attention to the person or musician announcing the item than the announced item itself.","Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportsmen or sportwomen are used in the ads.",0

The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers.

1457945.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Personally i completely agree with this statement. Not only do I think this statement is true, but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act. I'm sure that one of the most important guidelines to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful, first of all you have to spend a lot of it! All successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evolving their companies and buying or creating new ones. I also think that one of the most important things for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power! It really doesn't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached. keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives. I can pick up a very well known example of a person who has been really successful: Silvio Berlusconi. The intention is not to discuss his political ideas, but to examine the goals a person has reached. A man who has always lived following this principle. At the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developing new companies. Some of these are always in the field of media, but some are not, like the italian football team AC Milan which he bought 20 years ago. Another example can be seen in the american Bill Gates. Can you imagine if he had stopped creating and inventing computer software after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway.",Probably we would be less evoluted now.,0

For example one student planned to pursue a BIOTECHNOLOGY course in MASTERS DEGREE before knowing about the main idea means its applications and the idea means what about the future job aspects in this course, what is the use of learning about the facts that in Biotechnology means many new medicines for many diseases can be discovered?

I have three major reasons to say that. One of them is that newer types of car are being produced and the second is that transportation by car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that have to be made for people to transport The first reason for not agreeing with the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of car are being produced. These types include cars which work with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things. There are also plans to create cars which are flying near to the surface and this will provide a place for some more cars. The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars is very huge. There are other ways of transportation for example planes. They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church.","But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul.",0

Not being able to understand ideas and concepts and then predicting or learning facts means wanting to run not being able to learn how to walk. For example there are two students in the same class.

However, cars, as for me, will also exert a great influence on human society in the future. And their number will not even decrease. On the contrary, the development of cars will be surprising and momentous. Twenty years can be a long time or a short time, but the development of the quality of cars, including speed, security would be tremendously huge. People will definitely enjoy these obvious advantages in the thought of travelling to more places in the world that have become smaller and smaller. And there are also other aspects in their development. As you know, many institutes and countries have been doing research to find a fuel that possesses both efficiency and environmental benefits.

736900.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try. Once you begin with one subject ,you will be surprised at what it looks like and try to find out more about it. For example, you are having a toefl test. In this test , you don't know what the test looks like ,because you didn't take the test before. Hence, you will meet lots of difficulties in this test which you didn't predict ahead of time. And several good opportunities are given , and you have to overcome them one by one. Since that, you will know what you will do next time. That can be helpful for being successful.

To me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies, so the entire population depends on advertisements which show ""incredible products"" which can resolve many different problems, such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain, or how to repair a part of the furniture; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program. In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and wastes a lot ofmoney. For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one).

504053.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is important or learning the facts. Because every thing in our life ca not be understood through the ideas and concepts that need more creative minds. firstly when we talk about ideas and concepts these are sometimes easy to understand but some times very typical to understand. And this also depends on the type of mind that the student has. and understanding ideas and concepts also depends on the way we have brought in our life. because if a student is restricted to certain things in his childhood then he ca not have a creative mind. and if everything is understood through ideas then there will be a more number of scientists than normal people on the earth. And the other thing we have to talk about is learning facts that is learning throughexperiences. and everything we cant experience because if we think wearing a helmet can be implemented after facing any problem then its just like taking a chance in our life. and every thin cant be learned through facts because every thing cant be a fact in our life. because it is difficult to get every thing as a fact. and if we wait for a fact to happen in our life then our life will be completed just for learning and not for implementing those which we have learned. And the important thing is understanding ideas and concepts gives the sharpness to our minds as we go on understanding them but there are some concepts which ca not be understood through ideas but we can understand them through the facts, thus there is a need for facts. and learning things through the facts is a good thing which improves our practical knowledge. but every thing ca not be a fact so it is good to learn them from the ideas and concepts.",and the reproduction of plants and animals can be well understood through the facts.,0
680416.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Good marketing strategies and a lot of psychology are placed in advertisements. They want to make customers think they buy the best product on earth, but sometimes the companies are cheating. In my opinion it's true, that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The big bosses of the economy want to make big money by selling a lot of their products. To reach their thoughts, they would nearly do everything they could do. There are many reasons why managers try to reach much more money. One example is the stock market, which opens many people up to the possibility of being a shareholder of a company. They invest their money with the thought of getting more money back in the future and so they put the manager under great pressure, because he's the man who has the investments of the shareholder in his hands. I think that many managers don't want to be unemployed and so they start to find the best ways of selling. Some make their products without good quality, so that the customers need a new one after using them a few times. The disappointment of this is, that the products are presented as unbreakable wonders which can change the world. This strategy gets a lot of money for the company, but only for the first time, because the customers are not stupid and after buying one or two times this product they won't come back to the company with such a bad quality. So if the company wants to have success it has to improve the products, but they only do small changes and sell them the same strategy thez did the first time. In my opinion a lot of companies do it that way and that makes it very difficult to separate the good products from the bad ones.",The customers have to test the products even more clearly.,0

For a successful person there is always a challenge, a risk that has to be taken in order to continue his or her legacy, interesting or not that is the way they keep it up in order to gain, win and have success, and feel they are aboveeveryone. We have to remember that these people have already won and that perhaps, they think, that they have nothing to lose by trying new things, and by taking new risks, that is why they continue being on top of the world by their positive attitude and their challenging ideas. We also have to remember that eventhough they are successful they can also make mistakes and lose everything they have accomplished throughout their lives. but it is in their attitude, especially a positive attitude that makes them recover eventhough going against all odds and eventhough they do not recover from one, two events they will take this new challenge again,and risk.","We have to think that we are all successful people because we are, we are healthy, we have a job, we know a different language which gives us different and more challenging opportunities that in the end are going to help us even more in order to help others to be successful as well.",0

I do not think they are really enjoying their life. On the other hand, there are some old people who really like to go out and hang out with their friends. my host mother is an example of an old person who enjoys her life even more than me. she is in her 60s now and she loves to go out with her friends and go shopping. when she does not have work to do she always makes an appointment with her friends to do something. she never likes to be home all day doing nothing.",The second reason is that there are lots of things that allow old people to do but not for young people.,0

What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean,so it is impossible to pursue in many acedamics. The better way is to take a single subject. We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field. He gets the skills of innovation , works hard ,and tries to concentrate on his subject. since he is free to choose the subject of interest he will pursue with zeal and eagerness. He will be more clear about his future plans. There was a saying that"" jack of all,master of none"". this surely happens if someone enters into too many academic institutions. the main reason people forget one if they learn another. if a person enters many fields there is a chance of confusion and they end up in a mess. researchers also conveyed that people concentrating on different subjects can not gain anything. the more you go the less you will learn. according tomy opinion it is better to master a single subject than to make all the stuff included in the brain. by this he understands his aim and works to achievegoals.",he will get good fame.,0

Although there are still some young people who have paid some attention to their communities, it is my belief that they don't give enough time to help their communities. The first reason that causes young people ton't n't devote more time to their communities is the high competitive pressure in the education system.

Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result.

In my opinion, Almost all advertisements make products much better than they are in reality. These days, companies and businesses compete with each other to sell their products to more customers. They use the advertisements as an essential way to reveal the product to the customer and try to convince him about their product. They try so hard to show the best features of the product or the services that they have. Alternatively, they know the negative parts of their product or services, but they never say these parts unless they ask clearly to do so.

First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on.","Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place.",0

Nowadays, governments are doing their best to limit the number of cars, scientists are trying their best to invent new kinds of traffic tools and the public have begun to know the importance of protecting the environment. Therefore I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years. First, governments should ask for higher taxes for buying cars, and this will make fewer people have the eagerness to have a car. Providing more public transport tools is necessary for governments as well. In addition, convenient traffic lines and fine road conditions are also important elements. Imagine that one can get his goal place quickly and conveniently by a kind of public traffic tool, who else would like to have his own car with a high price of oil and high tax?

I do not agree with the claim. According to me, the number of cars will continue to increase though there might be a change in the technology which they use. As the population continues to grow, so do the needs. And the car is emerging as a basic need of the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, true. The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline in prices will continue as technology progresses. This would further encourage their sales in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one.

Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same. I believe, traffic is not just a waste of time; in addition, it is a waste of energy. For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour.",It means that everyday I spend 1 hour on theroads.,0

It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up!

On the one hand, petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable, for instance because they are in big cities. Moreover, governments are developing tubes, trains or buses to encourage people not to use their own car and to pollute less. For example, lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown on the tube in Paris. On the other hand, the population of Third-World countries is growing, and at the same time, lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering getting a car. Furthermore, lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent. For this reason, it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them up just every hour. Besides, scientists are considering developing cars with hybrid motors, which rely both on electricity and oil.",It could be a very good solution to the cost of oil.,0
1011356.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life.

890578.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

For example when the beautiful woman wore a dress in the magazine advertisements the dress seemed so beautiful because of the beauty of this woman. But when I wore the same dress the dress did not seem beautiful. Because I am not beautiful. Also the shape of the dress changed because I was fat and the dress was really tiny. I could not realize that the dress was tiny because the beautiful woman in the magazine was really thick and had a beautiful body. The second reason is that products in TV advertisements seem more useful than they really are. For example when the famous cook uses the knife in TV advertisements this knife will seem more useful.,Because the famous cook can really cook very well.,0
1005775.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In France the education system seeks to bring the most knowledge possible. There is no specialisation until high school and even there the specialisation is not really clear. As a result french students have got plenty of knowledge in several subjects but they have to do long studies to have precise knowledge of some things. I do not think that this way is the best way in the world in which we live, In fact, in our world we ask people to be ready to work very soon. And the fact is that you cannot work with broad knowledge. The only thing you can do is speak with people at restaurants and amazing them thanks to your general culture. Now to have a job you have to be specialised because the technology of our day is very specific and precise, you can work if you do not know your job precisely. For instance, what do we think of a doctor who knows a little about the economy, a little about astronomy and a little about the way the body of a man works. To my self, I would not want to see him when ever I am ill. But I have to say that things are different when you already have a precise knowledge of some thing. When you have a job and when you areable to do it well, having a broad knowledge of academic subjects is an interestingthing. First, it will help you to understand th e world you live in.

1734034.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The knowledge can be defined as the possibilities of everyone to speak on the biggest variety of subjects as possible. So it depends on the childhood, the luck to go to school and more generally of your life. For a student it is a good and a current question to know if he must choose early a speciality or keep during a long time many different lectures, What is the better choice ? It is not certain that the best choice exists. Nevertheless to my mind the recent evolution permits me to think that broad knowledge is preferred. The first example which accredits the thesis of broad knowledge is better is a farmer lost in a desert area with his cows he must primary know how to take care ofthem. It is easy to believe that he does not need to have broad knowledge in another speciality, but it is a restricted view. In fact if he wants his business to stay prosperous he needs to know how to read and write, it permits buying and sailing some cows or otheranimals. It is a simple example but there is another more technical  one. In the future the degree of expertise will increase so much.

I argue that older people enjoy life more than young people do, because of the fact that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time. Young people always have problems with their life. they never think time is very fast. they only live without the fear of death. for example i and my friend always have problems. because of our problem many of the time we dont want to do any things. we often speak about our problems. we think of going on holiday to reduce stress. Nevertheless we post pone it to another summer and another summer never comes so we never go anywhere. On the other hand, older people think time is very fast. For example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how she was an older woman. She says that if I fell as a young girl if i had the chance to live life again i would travel all over the world`. she always goes to the cinema to watch movies. she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she hasn't been to before.",moreover my grandfather is a very interesting old man.,0

Ofcourse, some people think that without facts it won't take too long to find out, but what if they didn't know if they were right. To put it this way, say that you want to learn something in biology in plants, animals, fish, reptiles, insects and mammels. To know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book, you can read through the main facts and details that were given to you. If you want to know something or investigate you need the facts about each topic that you were given in your biology book. If you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem. Also, another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened example, who killed someone or who is the one responsible for committinga crime.","To find out,you need to ask yourselves: ""How did he or she die and who killed them?

First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease.

I joined this club one year ago and at first I was surprised how many young people were offering their help there. All of these people are graduate students who use their free time after being in their courses and classes to spend it teaching other students. A major fact is that the other guys and I do not earn a lot of money by this activity. Since my first visit to the club I have been doing private lessons once a week. And I think it is a great honor to see the person taught by you getting better and better grades. I also have a friend who supports a poor family in Asia with 400 Euros a month.

A lot of people will know after talking to others if somebody has a wider knowledge or not. And if you have an interview for a job or an admission interview at university, your knowledge can lead you to your goal a good job or admission. Second if you have a good knowledge you can understand many more subjects and world problems than if you did not have it. And that will make your world more interesting.

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts.","Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying.",0
1015996.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. Successful people always think about new things. Because that is their confident behaviour to achieve their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses. He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job. He can make more effort to learn those things. Because he has to enter that field to work. then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts. Another example, imagine a successful state player of any game, he succeeded in his team with the state players. Then he tried to get a chance in the national team. He knows that it is very risky to get into the national team. However he struggled for his aim. He is able to face the difficulties, because he has already struggled to get into the state level team.",So it is easier for him to get into the national team.,0

354664.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I completely agree with the statement that ' successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very well known , it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction than everybody else does. Take for example the case of  the'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called the successful person even though he is not present, just because he did something different and tried a new thing that is the reason Reliance is so popular today. The new care taker of the Reliance company is the son of its founder, so we cannot call them equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his business. What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the business with not much money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established business. Taking risks is another part of success as it is a well saying ' more the risk involved, more the chances of success'. As one can also see, a good thing always involves a high amount of risk. To achieve good things one has to go through a series of risks involved, according to another saying ' to get the rose you have to suffer the pain of being hurt', and to achieve success the risk has to be taken no matter how painful it can be. Risks are involved in every new thing or you can say that risk is an internal part of every success one wants to achieve. If nobody had been ready to take risks there would not have been any new inventions. To be successful in life one has to go through one or some other kind of risk. Otherwise success would have been very easy without risk and every person would have been successful or you could say that every person would have been at the same level. Success involves risks. Suppose during the British rule over India if every person especially our freedom fighters, had not come forward considering the risks involved and would have lived the way the rulers wanted them to then would we have ever got independence? Ofcourse not, thats why to become successful and get the independence they had to take the risk of their lives.",We can also consider the example of economics in which we say 'higher the risk involved i.,0
876354.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide. When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore.

Also we have to take a look at the audience who can demand this kind of product.

Of course the first world is asking for the development of new industries in this field of consumption (cars) and this also, demands a lot of petrol and a lot of social politics inside the problem. It is a delicate tool to use against the arabian world to impose his power to take the fuel for the cars, because directly or indirectly all the industries of the cars ( even if they exist in Japan) have something made in America. In my opinion,. it could be too long to explain my real idea about that. I mean , last week I got my driving permit, Now I am crazy about driving, I would like to buy a cheap car to carry my Double-bass with me, to go to the gigs without the help of anybody.

1149373.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Cars have become a part of life in modern life. The car is very much essential today to do the things on time. I disagree with the given statement that ""in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"". In the olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking. the invention of the wheel changed the evolution greatly. after the invention of the wheel man introduced many new vehicles for transportation. he initially used bullock carts,tongas which were pulled by animals. In later life he introduced bicycles ,which served him well for travelling later he introduced motor cycles inorder to reach quickly with less effort,inthis process man thought of a luxurious way of travelling and he started to introduce vehicles running onfuel. he designed some of them for transportation of goods ,and some for humans,such as trucks and buses. And he later thought about the luxuries and privacy ,then brought the cars. cars were luxurious means of transportation in the early days. but it is compulsory now. this change has occurred because of globalisation and necessities. in the initial stages there were very fewcars ,people used to see it very intently. but nowadays in the developed countries many people have more than one car. The main problem with cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution. for this reason many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding more taxes  and parking fees. But people are ready to pay for that because they very much desire it.",the question is that there will be fewer cars in 20 years than now but ithink it will not happen.,0
268700.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","With technology developing so fast today, we have to say that science and technology have changed our world a lot. And transportation has also improved a lot compared to what it was years ago. Now, airplanes, underways, and ships are widely used in transportation. But if one says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. I strongly disagree with the view. First of all, cars are really convenient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short. It can drive from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday. No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above. For this reason, more and more people will buy cars on their own. Secondly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is an example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow. Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there was no transportation to there in the past. So with the demands of the families, there will be more cars on the roads in the future. More and more families would like to have cars at that time.","Lastly, we can find out that it is more and more busy on the ways now that before.",0
1150000.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the author's statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"". It is said that "" God will help them those who help themselves "" , it is implied that they take the risk and try out new things which may lead to great success. For example if Edison had not tried for a new thin he would not have invented the electric bulb. If Newton had eaten the apple, he would not have known the law of gravity. Always it is better to take calculated risks when ever required which helps us to flourish in life. When risk is taken the reward is sure some day. It is suggested that you try a new thing ,experiment which leads to development and growth in the field you are interested in. Aim for stars atleast you can seeeach moon. A good example for successful people is Gandhi, the father of the nation of india ,he tried a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took as much risk as he could , Finally he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land.",Thats why the risk is always rewarded which is for a good cause for the maximum benefitof mankind.,0

1911915.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons. First, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. For example, in 1995 when I was junior at Tokyo University in Tokyo Japan, I studied law and tax. One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law. One of my friends, Tanaka, is the best student studying economics and has a lot of knowledge of the bank system. He helped me. I was able to learn a lot of things about bank law. As the example shows, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. Second, having a variety of academic subjects is more fun. For example, in 1996 when I worked part-time at a private school, I taught Japanese History. I taught Japanese History ,Law and Tax in the historical class. Children in my class were interested in social systems. They asked me a lot of questions about history, law and tax. Some children wanted to study law. I had a good time at my lecture.",This experience clearly shows that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes me fun and brings me a good time.,0
237139.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I agree with the statement because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts. The first factor is age at this age as a student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are the first step for a student. At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts.,Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts.,0

From the very beginning of life and also today way of doing this thing is advertising. Although the advertisement is a crucial thing, most of them make products seem much better than they are. First of all, the function of the advertisement is also to advertise the product i. d. it must give reasons to the consumers in order for them to buy that product. While they are doing this they are trying to pass their rivals, so they do unpleasant things to achieve their goals. So, the advertisements would give us some information about the product that is incorrect. However, what is next? Next time that consumer will not buy that item and that product has a bad image on the consumer. The consequences are not very clear in every situation i. d. that product would be a one-time buyable item in which the server of that product's aim is to sell it just once.","But, this is also not a reasonable manner.",0

320403.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As time goes by, older people get more experience from their lives and they already have some fierce. So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people. As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people worked for a living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of their lives. Young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is a very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself. Sometimes, he looks like a working robot. I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working has become his routine life.",My father has worked hard for the living and he can't stop working even though he is rich enough.,0

Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people.

I support the statement because of the following considerations which i have taken into consideration. The first consideration is that man wants to enjoy comforts and is one of my major considerations. It is because the bikes cannot support the driver in all cases, that is in the rainy season. and the driver wants him which could help him to take him in any atmoshperic condition. this is the first time a person wants to have a car.

As their ambitious force them a new achievement, they want to learn new things even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they didn't know before about it because these kinds of people don't like monotone life. In my opinion, this knife is better than the other.

Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances.",There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to.,0
1526310.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this. When people watch television, read newspapers or walk in the street, they see a lot of advertisements. Even though people don't concentrate on that, they already have influenced. The first problem is the company cheats the customers. When the company makes a commercial for selling a product, they usually try to show their products as the best and they tell them only good points. Because they made people believe that products didn't have any defects and customers but it. However, there are also many bad points. It is one of the cheating. The other one is overconsumption. The commercial stimulates people to want to get those products and actually they don't need them, but they buy them. Sometimes buying is caused by developing the economy, but typically it has to disappear. The third reason is cost. If they make an advertisement, they need money and when they make an advertisement that looks better, they have to pay more. It is going to be caused by the increase. The increase will cause poor people to suffer from money.",The purpose of companies is to make money.,0
1015996.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. Successful people always think about new things. Because that is their confident behaviour to achieve their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses. He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job.

1658336.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Many people will have different ways of responding to this question. but most would say yes it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts. Understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life, once students understand concepts and ideas facts will come to them and, students will know what they are talking about later on. First of all, understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will naturally come to them. for example, in business, if the students boss tells them to go do this this and this the student will immediately understand the idea and once he has understood the idea he will naturally understand the concept in order to do something. Second, once the student understands the idea and concept behind something the facts will automatically come to him. for instance, once the student understands an idea he understands a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand facts because because all facts have an idea and a concept behind them. moreover, it would be hard for the student just to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life has concepts and ideas even facts. Finally, the student will know what he/she is talking about later on. say for example a student is trying to impress someone and she only knows facts she will say all the facts but will not understand what she is saying or even what isgoing on.","however, beforehand if this student were to know here concepts and ideas she could easily know what she/he is talking about later on when she gives a speech or wants to impress someone.",0

I understand that they are trying to sell their products alot, but they have to think about their customers to not be disappointed. I really enjoy watching TV, and there are lots of advertisements during the show break. Watching those advertisements makes me laugh, because I know that things will never happen. A few years ago, I saw an advertisement for a hair shampoo on TV, so I decided to try that because I thought my hair would be like the models on TV. I bought that shampoo, and tried it. On the first day, I did not see any difference, so I thought it took a while to be silky. I waited. Nothing happened. That shampoo was the same as the other products. Not one thing was different or special except the nice smell. I've been using it for a few years now, but still, nothing seems to happen.

As a result of it Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, will be publishing new types of programs every month or every two months. Because he doesn't want to lose his reputation and there are so many companies that want to see their programs make a better profit than him, sell more copies than Microsoft, Bill Gates' company, does. So he wants his company to keep improving and to make new products for computer users. Also a basketball or a soccer player needs to improve himself and try to add new things to his playing style.

1916426.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, the more the students are educated, the deeper knowledge they will have on their subject. However, some of them may have two majors. Which idea is good? In this essay, there are several reasons why I do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. First of all, everyone has got the same time. In other words, the condition to have an amount of study may be the same for everyone. If you spend all your time on a specific subject, you can improve a lot rather than the person who spends his or her time on two subjects. This is because he or she should divide the time. Let us assume that there are two students and the same time is offered: A person who only does economics and B person who does economics and politics. Compared with A person, B person would know more about politics. However, A person would know more about economics than a B person.","Secondly, in the sense that broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be useful for normal lives.",0
112005.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"".",In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation.,0
582057.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with people that try new things, and not stay without moving, waiting for something that can make their life better. Every body, also those who look satisfied with their own life, secretly hope it can become better than it is, and this feeling is positive, I think, since it pushes us to improve our life, trying to be happier. But how to change? How to get a better life? I think the answer is trying and risking. I did so, I went to England to find more interesting opportunities for my job, but I did not have anything in my hands, just courage. It has been difficult, because of the language but also the loneliness , but it can be done, with willpower. Of course, often the way is harder than one had thought at first, and the end can be different from what one would like it to be, but without playing, winning is impossible, and so always, I think, it is worth trying to do better.","On the other hand, obstinacy can become a serious danger to people.",0
23292.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with this statement because without learning the facts it can get you nowhere. Ofcourse, some people think that without facts it won't take too long to find out, but what if they didn't know if they were right. To put it this way, say that you want to learn something in biology in plants, animals, fish, reptiles, insects and mammels. To know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book, you can read through the main facts and details that were given to you. If you want to know something or investigate you need the facts about each topic that you were given in your biology book. If you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem. Also, another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened example, who killed someone or who is the one responsible for committinga crime. To find out,you need to ask yourselves: ""How did he or she die and who killed them? ""The questions will be answered if you give in every piece of information you have gathered when you want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people. Whether this person is guilty or not guilty.",Life is not easy with how it sounds when it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts but a faculty is the way that shows what can be featured and how you can explain it.,0

As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people.

It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts. It is a more difficult thing than learning facts. First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts isn't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think most of the kids don't know which of these. Do you know why? Most parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of things. And that makes children interested. Second, the facts and concepts are more specific things. All adults think, they are difficult for children so children don't have to know about that. That is not true. The truth is the adults don't know about the facts and concepts.

First of all, parents do not let their children experiment with how it feels good when they help their communities because parents think that helping the community is a waste of time. Even if the children try to do these kinds of things they punish them and tell them to concentrate on their studies and forget about these kinds of things Therefore, even if the child has the intention of helping his community his parents may let him down. As a result the child willdo the same thing with his children when he growsup. In addition communities are not the same as they used to be.","There are some certin customs that recent communityies think that they like a holy thing , they can not talk about it and say their opinion about it.",0
1226973.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good. However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons. First of all, most students learn a lot of subjects in school and have exams in each semester. However, it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part. For example, I learned many subjects from academic institutions such as history, nuclear  physics, and pantam physics. But i am the president of an online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me. Second, people can learn from their peers and family about something like history, music or art. Most sportsmen who play in Major League Baseball in the United States and Premier League Soccer in the U. K. in my country have learned their specific area for their life without studying a broad field. Sometimes, it is not good to communicate with others variously but it is nice to get a job and to be a professional.

A generalist is a person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects. A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge of one subject. I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject. A person with broad knowledge in many subjects, a generalist, can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject. So he can deal with any of the subjects.

1063116.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. First,only students have to learn facts,then they will understand ideas and concepts. Students have learnt facts by themselves that they would have a deep expression of what they have done. if we just let the students understand ideas and concepts,they might not really learn facts. To let the students understand ideas and concepts is a requirement,but to let the students learn facts is more important. Second,how does students understand ideas and concepts better than learn facts? For instance, we read a novel story,we know what it talks about,but sometimes we might mistakenly know what we have learnt about. On the other hand,if you have learnt facts. then it is easier for you to understand ideas and concepts more clearly. For students' studies,the main point is to learn facts no matter what kind of subjects. it is proved that it is always true. So, if you want to learn fast? learn facts! it will help you a lot. Last,as we know,learning facts is more difficult for students to understand ideas and concepts.","For most students, they always did the ideas and conveyed fist,then went on to research facts,at the end of it, they would spend lots of their time on it,and it did not deserve it.",0

For example,if they have their cars, they will save time and they can go everywhere they want. Cars will become the most important things in people's lives. Then the demand for buying a car will be increasing. For example, nowadays one house has more than one car. Because they want to move individually, so they just get one's car.

On the one hand, some people believe that cars will be reduced in near future. The cost of maintaining a private car is increasing due to the high price of oil and public transportation services are revised these days. It would be much more comfortable to use public transportation rather than a private car. Furthermore, the new means of transportation is developing now.

96578.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Thinking that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is difficult to believe.

Like I've said, all the developing countries need communication ways if they want to have a place in this world, and the car is the first key to success. With communication exchanges created, and the best support of exchange is the car. In our developed countries, the statistics prove that more and more people use their car for short trips. Nowadays, the high price of oil pushes people to use fewer cars, but in the future, new energy sources will be invented. The car has become a part of the occidental way of living, and it will be very difficult to change the facts. A car is also a sign of independence : the freedom to go where and when we want to. Most european cities are built to get used to cars, even if public transport exists. In a kind of way, the car is a part of the occidental culture, and the same situation can be remarked in some other continent. The car is also considered, in many countries, as a symbol of richness - and it's a really important social phenomenon.",This selfish way of thinking shows very well the occidental psychology.,0
929457.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to try to reach good lifestyle standards therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things. Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrast, some think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well. I actually agree with the first idea. these are my following reasons Firstly,success is related toresponsibility. When successful people try new things and take risks they trust their responsible characteristics. For example i know a professor who is so successful at his job. Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to them. In addition to this he never leaves his jobs because ofluck. He usually plans his works and lives for them. Actually this feature brings success to him In addition to this,success is reletead withexperience. If a person has experiences in life or business or human psychology he/she can achieve success very easily. Also these experiences help the person to try new things and take risks in a comfortable way. Plus the person can feel relief depending on the experiences. for instance i have a friend who is so willing to travel and see the world. Moreover she has many kinds of experiences all over the world. Basically these experiences help her in her job to be more successful. She is not afraid of trying new things thanks to her experiences.",If people do not live the experiences they can not know the things which they face.,0
1758784.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"First of all I want to say, what the question deals with. I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part. You should know everything about this part. I want to give an example. If you want to specialize in marketing,you have to know everything about it. You can only be hired in this part of a firm. And if you are not needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked. But if you have knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm. A third advantage of broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things. you can learn new things in all parts of academic life. It would be boring if you did the same things the whole of your life. A broad knowledge gives you the possibility that you can change your work. Your life would be more exciting.",To finish the text I want to give reasons why this is in my opinion.,0
1268660.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I will agree with the following statement that ,it is more important for the student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts. For students who learn the facts ,it will be temporary in their minds. when students understand ideas and concepts it will be inthe mind permanently. Firstly students in the school will follow the process of understanding the ideas and concepts of a particular topic. For example students learning the subjects like Physics ,mathematics , there is a need to understand the ideas and concepts related to the problem or topic. by knowing the concepts and ideas he can these ideas any where in that field.

When students start to understand the idea and concept of certain questions, they will find what was the cause, and how it works. It's like grapes. All the teeth of guiers are matching perfectly the machine works. Therefore, to understand what they are studying deeply, then they need to understand what the idea of it is.

I argue that older people enjoy life more than young people do, because of the fact that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time. Young people always have problems with their life. they never think time is very fast. they only live without the fear of death. for example i and my friend always have problems. because of our problem many of the time we dont want to do any things. we often speak about our problems. we think of going on holiday to reduce stress. Nevertheless we post pone it to another summer and another summer never comes so we never go anywhere. On the other hand, older people think time is very fast. For example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how she was an older woman. She says that if I fell as a young girl if i had the chance to live life again i would travel all over the world`. she always goes to the cinema to watch movies. she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she hasn't been to before. moreover my grandfather is a very interesting old man.",he is a good tennis player.,0
736900.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try. Once you begin with one subject ,you will be surprised at what it looks like and try to find out more about it. For example, you are having a toefl test. In this test , you don't know what the test looks like ,because you didn't take the test before. Hence, you will meet lots of difficulties in this test which you didn't predict ahead of time. And several good opportunities are given , and you have to overcome them one by one. Since that, you will know what you will do next time. That can be helpful for being successful. Secondly, knowledge can be an aid to anyone who can help you to be successful. But first of all, how can we get knowledge?

A student who got good marks in an examination ca not become a good engineer or doctor or infact, be good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good. Thus, application is important for a student who comes with an understanding of the subject. A practical understanding of the subject is preferred rather than simply knowing it ,this is the reason why nowadays education orl study is based on formal work rather than simply class room teaching. each and every course of today whether you take a science or art or technology project and the field work isintroduced.

First of all having a knowledge of many subjects does not mean having lots of essential things. People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use them together. Because those are different things. But when people are taking some research into similar subjects it can help them with lots of things. Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas.

So people who live in the country side, they use their own car now. I also use my own car. The number of cars in countryside has increased more than before. But on the other hand, now gasoline is so expensive. If this situation continues, the number of cars may decrease. I imagined that reason. But, I think if the cost of gasoline is expensive, the bus company will change the timetable so as not to move out. That is why, people will have to use their own car. Japanese companies like Honda and Toyota are famous in many other countries.

Although advertisements sometimes are necessary, there are still a lot of deceiving and misleading things to customers. Also for me is a waste oftime seeing , hearingand reading advertisements.

1470044.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students have a number of ways to learn nowadays. Personally, it is much better when I study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea. I believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than facts is the best way to succeed. Learning facts is very hard to keep because you could forget them over time, Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments, And finally students' skills can be enhanced. It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days. While understanding the concepts could help for a long time. For example, understanding why the battle started, what the conditions were after the battle finished, and so on. It could be in your brain longer than learning facts. Understanding concepts could be valuable when you are studying a different topic. For example, the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict. On the other hand, if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even, maybe you have to study again for your business or your geography class. Students could develop better skills if they learn concepts and ideas. They could argue for example, why the battle happened, or even learn that war conflict is not the best way to thrive. They could even be interested in and pursue a carer in history. I think learning concepts and ideas from a topic, gives you many opportunities for your future life. For all these reasons, I support the statement that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts.","It improves their skills, helps them to other subjects and enhances their skills.",0
57409.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,Over the last fifty decades education has been a significant role in people's lives. Because of that they have research into lots of subjects or just one. Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other people think that the better one is to specialize in one specific subject. First of all having a knowledge of many subjects does not mean having lots of essential things. People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use them together. Because those are different things. But when people are taking some research into similar subjects it can help them with lots of things. Knowledge of lots of things does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when. When a person has lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas. Because of that people can prefer this way. Secondly specializing in one specific subject can be more acceptable to everyone. When people are interested in one subject they can continue with this material and they can be a professor. And also if a person knows everything about a subject they also have learned some different things.,People who have a knowledge of a specific subject have a more successful life than others who have none.,0

Many companies have made many DM and advertisements to attract their customers. For the company, they just want people to buy their products. The advertisements are just a way to present their thoughts. However, the real product is not really like the advertisement.

815021.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I can see both advantages and disadvantages to trying new things and taking risks to be successful. You can choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risks to be successful. I definitely believe that people should try new things and take risks to be successful. If you do everything with a routine that means you know the results. For example if a farmer uses traditional methods for agriculture, he can guess how much crops he will get. He can avoid risks by doing that. But it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he willn't be successful. He will get the same amount of crop as next year. The point I am trying to make is, that it is not a desirable way to be a successful person. On the other hand he could try different ways in order to get a lot of crops which means taking risksfor success. In my opinion, successful people try new things and take risks. For instance, if the farmer tries a new way which he has not experienced before he can get a different amount of crops. he could get whether '' less or much'' but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk. I already know that lots of successful people in the business area try new things and figure out new ways. That is the main reason for their success.",For instance a very well known newspaper owner was just a writer in a newspaper.,0
1114004.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone.",After that actually we can trust the people.,0

Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately.","For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days.",0

Answering such a question as `do young people enjoy life more than older people`` is therefore very hard. I personally agree with this claim because of young people's physical and mental advantages, The time young people live provides more entertainment. Firstly, because of the effects of years all humans become old and their physical attributes fall down, for example they can not run as fast as they could before, they need more time to sleep any way they can not do what they want. their bodies do not let old people do what they want. On the other hand young people have more energy, they are stronger and they can spend more time enjoying themselves.","For the reason that older people lived in their younger time more enjoyable their wish to enjoy themselves, become less important.",0

Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia, Fila. etc. They tried new things and took risks. For example.

619171.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There is a controversial issue about whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Depending on personal experience, personality type and viewpoints of the globe , we may find that some people may hold the opinion that there will be more cars in twenty years than in today, on the other hand, some people may choose there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than in today. The choice, nevertheless, is not easy to make. However, from my point of view, I would like to believe the latter one is more reasonable. Because there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now, my arguments are listed as follows. An essential reason that can be seen by everyone is that the gas released from cars in big cities pollutes the environment around us seriously. According to a recent survey announced by the Minister of Health of China, cars' gas pollution accounts for 38. 7% of the total pollution which harms our environment. This strongly demonstrates that car pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be fewer cars used in our lives. Another reason for my inclination is that the number of cars makes the cities become overcrowded and It is very inconvenient for people to go to study , work and so on. For instance, in a big city, It usually takes one person to live on the outskirts one or even two hours to arrive at the company he/she works for in the center of the city.",So this is very convenient.,0

I joined this club one year ago and at first I was surprised how many young people were offering their help there.

It is good for people's minds, solving many problems simultaneously. First of all, knowing many things is helpful to someone's life. From learning many academic subjects, we can broaden our knowledge and common sense. Also, we can meet many people who study other fields, and speak to each other.

1244220.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons. Firstly, if a person is focused on a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge, because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field. Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people to know many things from a superficial view; it is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field. I can concide that broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff. But that is not usually the common case because most people work in medium or large companies. Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself. Usually general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be inserted.",We can consider also this dilemma is the history.,0
1165565.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"The answer to this statement depends on personal life experience and different cultural background. Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. However, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone rather than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conspicuous aspects as follows. The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guides lead you to and have no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get access to the local people' s life and culture. Through talking and living with them, you can have different cultures and perspectives on life. That will only present you with a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world. there is another reason deserving some words here. Travelling in a group led by a tutor is a waste of money in some conditions. Because the guide depends on the money you spend on the trip to survive. They usually convince the traveller things that have no value become necessities and buy them. In contrast , if a person travels along a person can use a computer to get information about an unknown place. Through the internet a traveller can find things they reallyneed,such as local tasty food , tickets for museums and other basic necessities.",They save money and spend it on the trip.,0

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts.

Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying.

It says the importance of learning not only the facts but also the "" way"". But it highlights the importance of the way. Like this old saying, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. First, If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions. For example, when I was a middle school student, at the start of math class, I couldn't understand what the teacher said. But finally understood the way of solving the math problems, I could solve another math question. Although that question was more difficult, I understood the way of solving it so I could do it. If I couldn't understand, I couldn't answer that question. Second, If students understand ideas and concepts, they can imagine more ideas and concepts. I mean, for instance, when I was a high school student, I learned about poetry. Most people don't like poets because of their words. Those words were difficult to understand except by the teacher.

I agree with this opinion, because young people nowadays are so busy with their own things, and they have a poor ability for communication, and they regard the community as not so important. First, young people are very busy, because they need to go to prep school after school. In japan, at the end of primary school, there are entrance examinations to junior highschool. So they need to study hard. Moreover they learn many kinds of things, for example, tennis, swimming, piano, something like that. After entering university, they are busy with social life such as parties, part-time jobs, dates. There is no time to spend on their communities.

For example, a game center is the place where we can play many games. Many young people go there and enjoy games. However it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people. Also, I think that young people have a chance to communicate with people more. Young people go to schools and meet friends. They can also join many activities outside of school. Older people may join in with some activities but there are not many activities for older people.

Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price.

1123424.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised.

1646354.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion this statement is true. I think this is because young people are at the beginning of their lives and not in the middle or at the end of it. You can recognise it if you start a new job. Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or months you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting. Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You should not be concerned about whether you have enough money either if you have a job or not. It does not matter to you. On the other hand it really depends on how people have planned theirlives.","The most grown up people I know, have a house or an apartment somewhere, children and a job.",0

1707879.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In the context of constant competition between products and trademarks, what makes them different ? Is it the product, the advertising or the trademark ? We'll see that ""false"" advertising is necessary for a company and is controlled by the rules of competition. Finally, we'll see that advertising isn't the product underneath but much more an identifying suggestion for customers. First, a company that launches a product cannot possibly find a large scale of customers without promoting it. Therefore, a company needs advertisements to exist or to continue existing. With the laws of competitions, the advertising is in a way self-controlled. As we saw last week with ""L'Oreal"", a company cannot say anything in an advertisement. They have to be able to prove their assertions in an advertising campaign otherwise other companies will sue them for a lack of accuracy that damages the market competition. Second, companies usually ""lie"" about their product because they won't tell you immediately the side effects or problems you might encounter with the use of the product. Advertising will sell you the good effects of the products. But, I do not think the real matter is the product underneath. I mean more and more advertising does not sell you a product directly but an underground, an atmosphere or a celebrity. In a way, advertisements are here to help you identify a trademark, the one you want to look like or lifestyle you want. And, an advertising campaign is more like a dream maker, suggesting that you need the product if you want to achieve a certain lifestyle or look like a celebrity but it didn't tell you that you will achieve it.","Advertising just shows you the way because : ""you worth it"" and ""just do it"".",0

It is my belief that, there are several reasons that cause this situation. But, not only young people, but also the environmental situations are the reasons for this problem. This problem may be first explained by the changes in young people. It is my belief that we are getting more selfish from generation to generation and starting to think only about ourselves. A few years ago, when our country was in a difficult situation, everyone had the consciousness to do something for his/her country, but now we only think about what we can do to save ourselves. One of the causes of this problem is the consciousness that is given to young people in their home, by their parents. The most important place where a person learns most of the things that he/she will use during his/her life is his/her home. In the older times, parents were more careful about this situation, but as time passed, as the problems of the parents increased about their children, giving community consciousness is not anymore an important problem for the family.","Another place, that where young people are educated is school.",0

There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else.

Because facts are real but ideas are not. You can learn so many ideas about something but you can't apply these ideas in real life. It is not important if you don't apply ideas in real life.

1008486.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"People have their own ideas about whether traveling alone is better than traveling by a tour guide or not. In my opinion, the best way to travel is by yourself, because it can be free to tour places and easily make new friends in the new place. First, traveling alone enables us to feel free to move on the tour site. Some people may think that moving to new places alone is dangerous because we do not know about the places. In my opinion, However, traveling alone can benefit us to have more chances to see sight seeing. For example, If I tour with other people on time, I cannot see museums and churches that I want to visit except determined sites. Then I do not feel satisfied with the tour. In this way, I can say that traveling along gives us more chances to visit than traveling in a group. Second, when it comes to making new friends, moving alone greatly contributes to making it possible.",it is generally agreed that traveling in a group is difficult to make new people as they have to move to the scheduled sightseeing sites.,0

The abundant numbers actually create a lot of problems for their city and the world. All these problems will finally force us to use fewer cars. Therefore,I agree there will be fewer cars in twenty years' time. The traffic problem is actually the most important reason for the increase in the number of cars. Traffic jams can seriously attack the economy. It can affect the run of the economic system. For example , traffic jams can delay the conveyance of goods of different industries, They can lower the productivity of the whole economy, Since that,different governments of big cities will tightly control the number of cars. To combat the traffic problem, the government will encourage people to use the massive transportation, just like the underway, and discourage people from using and buying private cars.

In my opinion the number of cars in twenty years will most probably increase. There are different reasons why. The economy tries to sell more cars and did very well in the last decades. So I wouldn't expect them to work less effectively during the next twenty years. The trend goes to more consumption and the automobile sector is huge in a time when flexibility and local independence are wanted from companies. Also the basic for driving a car, petrol, is secured for the next hundred years. That makes it even more unlikely that a branch will increase its production.

If I can not communicate in English and not my mother tongue, I worry about it. I may not be able to listen to a guide and not to see the direction. Then I may get lost. In my case, I traveled in London alone. I have a map and book which has the details about that city. I walked around the city while I looked at the book. But I got lost.

246766.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, advertisements have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product. All is studied to make it attractive, brilliant, colourful, nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful. It has occurred many times that the product was truly disappointing compared to the advertisement. Of course, it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as ""fabulous"" as they were supposed to be. I spent some money on various things, from CDs to a DVD player, beauty products for my sister or very diverse things, which happened to be smaller than they were said to be, less efficient or to break very easily. My brother, who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be. The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player, for example, is not as varied as it was written on the box. Apart from the high technology, I would tend to say that advertising does not lie so much about food products. Is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it? We can buy a television once within a couple of years, be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority, it is different from the food advertisements, or the items we regularly need to buy.","Actually, if it does not satisfy us, consequently we will buy another brand.",0
1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate. I reason when people hear about a product they should research on the internet or something like that. It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already. Maybe they can get more than money. I think most of the advertisement lies because my mother always says this one, ""if your merchants are good you do not have to call somebody to come around you and take my product.","If you are good already all the people who take your product you do not have to sell yourself as much as possible"".",0

1142118.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In many situations, as human beings, people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occur once in a while. Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step to leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into a --- normal person. From not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life. To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But, when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists? This is because of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus, finally he got the Nobel prize for his achievements. Not only, will he be remembered but his work of investment and achievement on the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of society.","Further more, a famous French writer called ""Silva Plyth"" is famous for the poems that she wrote, the sadness and emotions through her poems; by reading her poems, emotions and a sense of sadness would soon arise.",0

1216752.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes for most people. When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strict schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone. As to me, my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it. Suppose, I plan to visit a historical place, which is relevant to my subject, and even most people do not know it, I may have to go there alone. On the contrary, if my destination is Yellow Stone park, I would like to join a group, so I can communicate with other members.

But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world.

What are the communities? The communities may be some sport, music or religious. And what is helping? Helping may mean helping in the family (which is part of the community) or by helping direct the community. There are several methods of helping in communities. These methods have changed over the years: in the old days people were perhaps more friendly and more helpful to each other. They were another generation and had other living conditions. I also think that the people have had another familiar surroundings in which they lived and worked. As young people they had to help the family e. g by going into the fields and doing farming. They also used to help other families, because they benefited from each other. The families had not so much money and so many things like we have today. So helping was very important. This was a community in those days. Nowadays the familiar surroundings are not so close as they were a hundred years ago. There are more singles or more families with divorced parents. So the surroundings in which young people live nowadays are completely different to those who lived a hundred years ago. But this fact I think is the critical point: young people nowadays want to have a bigger or a more family like family.

Older people have the treasure of wisdom among knowledge, with a conviction of lots of experience, they have the mature and most important quality, patience. I have seen older people enjoying life more then younger people, but also, comes to a cost of good health.

But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?.

We are sure that even in this way, we are going to change the world. because change happens. but the problem is: will it be better? we don't know. but we will think that we were happy when we were young. because we lived every moment with an excessive intensity! i want to demonstrate what i meant to say. there are about eighty words left.",if i had wanted to think i could have written a lot of other things.,0

1879085.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do agree that young people enjoy life more than old people do. Young people are young,they have time to do what they like. They may go to a dance hall every night to share a wonderful time with their friends,or sleep for an entire day just because it's comfortable. Young people are inexperienced,so they can try everything that they feel exciting. They may climb trees and hills, travel across rivers and oceans to experience the glory of nature. They may easily take bills that take all the money, because they got an idea to try a new thing,and then they think it's worthwhile. Young people are confident,they will do every thing that they want to do. They may just have a little company with a little money,and then try their best to make it gloomy. They may also get crazy in their dreams,to be a painter,dancer,engineer or many other careers. Young people are never too young,if they want ,they can do anything. No matter how others are considering their behaviors and how astonishing their behaviors are,once decided to do that,they will never stop.

695190.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In this essay I will shed light on the statement, that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. It is important, that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding, but mainly these dates and names can be researched in a book, or on the internet at almost any time. Although, some very important key facts must be memorized.","When I was in a conversation with an American visitor in Genova, standing in front of the Columbus museum, I could not remember, when America was discovered.",0
1075656.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing.","Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives.",0
200229.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with this statement, as i do not see why it would be correct. It contains no arguments to support its claim. Young people do give enough time to helping their communities nowadays, as they always have. I do not see the reason for elderly people to believe in this statement, or to view our youth in a critical manner. Yes, the youth might be somewhat different than the generation of people they grew up in, but it does not need to be different in a negative way. Their criticism merely demonstrates their inability to take responsibility or to adapt to recent events, which would bring about a difference in mentality in the next generation. Most probably people making such a statement are not satisfied with their own contribution to their communities and will try to ease their minds by making such a claim. Often pensioners who have nothing better to do, i. e. make no contribution to their communities, make such a claim. This statement is in no way a constructive statement, as it gives no suggestion of changing the circumstances. Therefore the person putting forth this statement is not helping his community in doing so.","This statement is so broad, that it is hard for me to think of any specific examples out of my head, but in general, young people are the people who drive a community and contribute to its culture through their motivation.",0
266989.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Imagine your life without Air?. Advertisements like air for businessmen. The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world. As one man, if you have agood advertisement about your product, you will have agood idea around the world. Beacuse T.",V can show your advertisements to be good.,0

136109.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly agree with the statement that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth. It's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products. But sometimes,the products really disappoint clients. For example:once a day,when I was too young,a university student knocked on my room door while I was lonely in the house. She recommended a type of shoe that was very good. It could prevent from humid and fire. Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes,it didn't get firing. Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting,as a consequence,I bought it. But only after some days,I found the shoes hadn't got a good texture and were destroyed by walking. Then from these advertisements,I take a lesson:Don't believe adversisements! When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive,it means in other aspects,maybe they are controversial. When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not. Watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of the world. And some advertisements are too artistic or dramatic, which attract people very much. Like microsoft's advertisements for pentium 4. They tell us a new generation of computers,Though high- technology such as computers,mobile phones, mp 3s are improving very quickly. But they are the fashion. And for me,I think high-technology and make-up things are toys. They are changeable like the toys I played with during my childhood.

669962.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Have you ever an uncomfortable feeling, when you watch the mass media because of news? There is so much news and new information in mass media such as newspapers, TV, radio. Sometimes, we should think about whether it is true or not. Because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For the person who wants to know, there are a couple of reasons. First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point. Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product. For instance, as you know, fast food is not good for your health. However, the companies which produce fast food, they usually hide the fact which can cause problems for the body like cancer. In particular, for children, they can be addicted to fast food because they just see the advertisement which looks delicious. Secondly, the advertisements can advertise the thing in the wrong way, It means the truth can be hidden by force.","In illustrative, there are specific rumors about a newspaper company in my country.",0
1200117.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I do agree with the statement, but i can not be completely sure about it. It is a fact that oil prices are higher than ever before. Also, pollution shows a lot of economic and environmental problems and it is enough a reason to stop using cars because of their lack of usefulness in the cities. Oil prices are a principal problem for western countries which haven't their own oil supplies. For example in europe, it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes, insurance and enormous fuel costs. Also the cost of space in major cities makes the price rise. One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe, e. g. the government in Vienna is making cycling routes in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its inhabitants. Holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car. A city designer in London said that cars shouldn't design the city. He meant that cities are not made for cars but for humans. This statement has its truth, when one compares cities in newer countries with older ones. European cities have a natural structure. The old parts mostly the centers aren't designed for cars but more for humans. American cities like Caracas have major problems with mobility of humans.",Of course they have a metro but the cars made the appearance of the city.,0

I think in twenty years there will be lots more cars in use than there are today. In this essay I will give some reasons and good examples why i think like that. the first reason is that most people would like to have a car. because cars are the most comfortable and most exciting preference for people to go somewhere quickly. In fact this reason is really a considerable one, which is why people can not change their opinion. for example I have a car and when I want to go somewhere my first option is to take my car.",instead of taking buses or walking.,0
161841.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics. Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. One of the reasons for students to clearly understand ideas and concepts is motivation. If students understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the importance of eating healthily. Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me an example of how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system. At that time I was able to learn how the heart works.",Finally understanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity.,0
1737605.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some say it does not. In my opinion, however, young people enjoy life rather than older people do because, they are impulsive, energetic, and creative. Firstly, it is generally accepted that young people are more impulsive than old people. Therefore, young people usually do things without certain plans. For example, in my personal experience, I have been on a trip without any plans with my friends. One day, one of my friends suddenly suggested going on a trip and we just agreed to go on a trip that day, because we were young and impulsive. Secondly, it is normally accepted that young people are more energetic than old people. In fact, it is hard to enjoy life such as going on a trip or going on a picnic for old people because they are less energetic. However, young people are always energetic in general. Therefore, it can be described as one reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Lastly, it seems clear that young people are more creative than old people. They always bring something new and creative and move into action. It is one of the ways that they enjoy their life creatively. Moreover, in my personal experience, one day, I and my friend were thinking about making fake IDs. Therefore, we moved into action and tried it.","Unfortunately or Fortunately, we were charged by a police officer lightly, however, it exists as a still interesting memory for me.",0
1419617.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In my opinion i would agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are many reasons and ways in which people can make low quality products look brilliant. The main highlight which people see is the packaging of the product which can be excellent and also interesting also through tv and newspaper advertisements people give in easily without knowing the quality of the product just because they have seen or heard from their friends and neighbours. A product which can be good for others need not necessarily be good for you because nowadays on the market there are more fake products than there are original ones. The choice is yours whether you would be comfortable with the product and whether it satisfies your needs it would be safe to buy from a store where there are more customers which shows the market value. I would also disagree with the following reasons. first, a new product which comes onto the market may look bad but can also turn out to be excellent Eg-A new shampoo which your friend has used has caused her hair to have split ends this may not necessarily happen to you you may have a better reaction to this product like even for perfumes you either like the smell or you dont. Mainly advertisements are the best technique to sell a product and a good way to get recognized in the market. other methods also include selling the product through door to door selling.",People in the world believe many advertisements which come in magazines or newspapers -For a fitness program medicines there are many frauds in the market selling fake medicines instead of the original and these cause people to destroy their lives due to the expenses and uncertainity of the item.,0
1104207.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"How would you react if an adult tells you that he was more happy when he was a child? Does it mean that becoming an adult, dissipates happiness and good times? According to my own experience , i think that people were getting happier when they were children. They just live how their mind guides them through without thinking about consequences. Firstly ,I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything material. They live their life without thinking about the consequences. Indeed, everything they wanted to do is possible, so they just have to realise what their hearts tell them to do. People are used to saying that mankind is led by money and interest,contrary to children who are only guided through life by happiness and pleasure. For example a young boy does not care about what his mum is doing.","But her mum must take care of her baby,and she has to shelter him and protect him from dangers.",0
1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil.",Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on.,0

1110655.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I strongly disagree with advertising activities making products seem much better than they really are. This is a case of manepulating customers' decisions. Some times this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees. Companies and goods sellers should talk and describe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising them in a proper and honest way are mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials of high quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are. Another way of fair advertising activities, is highlighting the efforts that were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection.

Some people prefer studying broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learning the academic subject of one specific subject provides narrow knowledge for people. However, I strongly prefer studying the academic subject of one specific academic subject because it strengthens people's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledge in one specific subject. First of all, I prefer specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learning environments. Learning many academic subjects needs a lot of time. Moreover, if some academic subjects are not interesting to people, then the environment discourages people's studying ability For example, according to a study by one of the most famous professors Dr. Kim, Republic of Korea, 68.",9% of people like learning one exciting academic subject because it makes people's good studying circumstances.,0
1457945.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Personally i completely agree with this statement. Not only do I think this statement is true, but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act. I'm sure that one of the most important guidelines to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful, first of all you have to spend a lot of it! All successful people such as factory owners, broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evolving their companies and buying or creating new ones. I also think that one of the most important things for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money, of course, we all know that ""money makes the world go around"", but also for a feeling of desiring power! It really doesn't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached. keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives.

It was a little fan that could be tied on the arm, which could be used for cooling off the hot noodles while people were picking up the noodles. The fan is not tiny, but even if it is, is there really a lot of consumers for this kind of product? I do not think so.

At the beginning of the statement, I think one of the important reasons that people can be successful is because successful people have already done this thing as they are successful ,they use more time than other people , they continue their work all day , not give it up,so they are successful. It is not too easy to be successful for every successful person. Second, successful people do the same as other people. They just have more experiences than other people , At this time, they would have many experiencesto fair when they do this thing but nobody knows it. Successful people are not cleverer than other people,only harder working than other people.

But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful.

However some peoplen'tdon't. They hold the opinion that successful people would try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages. From my personal perspective, i would prefer the second opinion. first of all, doing what they already know how to do well is safer to get success, however, it may also make you lose something that may even more important. Since it is a world of changing, everything is changing in every minute, if you only do what you already know at your times, you may fall behind the times.

First of all, I think it is very difficult to compare a society at different times. It is often heard that young people were more respectful and more polite in the past, but which past? During the last century, society in developed countries changed radically, hence it is very difficult to compare young people now and in the beginning of the twentieth century.","For example, in the Middle- Ages , there were a lot of wars and young people had to help their communities fighting against people.",0
1085283.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts are things that are true no matter what and in pretty much every scenario. Although ideas and concepts can vary. Ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete. Concepts can be altered , modified or even proven to be false. A fact would be, what goes up must come down. That is a proven fact. No matter where you are on earth, whatever is launched up into the air does not matter how high, it will eventually come crashing down back to earth due to the gravitational pull. An idea and concept on the other hand would be the evolution from monkey to man. This is just an idea nothing is for certain about this hypothesis or concept. Many people may believe otherwise, that man's kind originated from Adam and Eve and that they both lived in the garden of Eden. Although one may be more believable than the other they are just ideas and different concepts made up of different people whom may have influencedothers. That is another problem with ideas, they can be forced upon a person. It is not like a fact which is impossible to prove false. Therefore, you have no choice but to believe it.","On the other hand, an idea or concept there is reason to doubt.",0
809338.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,Today it is very difficult to invent new things or find new ways to be successful. But what is the best way to be successful? Should you take risks? And for which people is it easier to take risks? In my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk. Because there must be no reasons because this person is unsuccessful. So perhaps an unsuccessful person has already taken some risks which were not successful. So they are kind of afraid of taking new risks. If the new idea is wrong they will lose again. And this is different for successful people. They have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risks. They are not afraid. If the risk was wrong there is a basis under them and nearly nothing could happen to them. But one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risks. For this I will give an example.,You have to imagine you are the CEO of a big company and at the moment the number one with your products in the world.,0

Here are my reasons. First, if one person doesn't want to give enough time to help other people that means he is selfish. I joined an interview process and new hired people training at my company. In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help. Once I worked for a local campaign , but I always helped people and did some volunteer work for a patient group. Till I want to work at a Global company. Some people help me to get an interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities?

I think you have to know the source of the facts not only the answer. The how and why is important to understand the facts. I think it is more important to understand concepts and ideas for two reasons: You know the source of the fact and you learn more about one topic. First, when you understand ideas and concepts from the beginning you are able to understand the factsbetter. When you only know the facts you ignore how they start. For example you know that an earthquake is dangerous and the earth moves , but if you know the concept and the idea you can take precautions and stay safe , even if you can move to some place that does nt have earthquakes.

The students' main aspect of learning things is by understanding the facts beside them and the other way is to understand the ideas and concepts about them.

1367007.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"It is natural that a student studying harder can get a higher grade than others. However, if he doesn't study efficiently, he will not get the result he expects. I firmly believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. This is not only because students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible sources on the internet reduce the necessity of learning facts themselves. To begin with, students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful, For example, most subjects in school require logical thinking rather than memorizing facts. When I was in high school, I was one of the book worms. However, my grade was not improved as much as I studied. In the freshman years, I didn't know the reason but I came to know the reason after I met my friend, James, in the second year. He always tried to understand the ideas and concepts so that he studied very efficiently and got a better grade than me.","On top of that, I think people who can understand ideas and concepts also love society because they can solve problems quickly.",0

Learning facts is very hard to keep because you could forget them over time, Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments, And finally students' skills can be enhanced. It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example. They could help you answer the questions in your test of history. But you could forget it after a few days.

1661173.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students are of different types and the way of preparing for their subject and the way they approach the subject are different when compared to each other. Some people go around the concept and the ideas of the subject and what the main aim and the use of the subject are and they go in a different manner to get the subject. Some students just blindly take the text books,and not only text books and they collect a lot of material and they just go blindly reading those facts that are in the books and material,so in this case the students wont get the practical knowledge of the subject and just blindly know what the subject is. These people cant do the practical problems and they cant go deeper into the subject. It is also important that after getting the idea and the concept of the subject the student should go front reading the facts regarding the subject. That makes a lot of knowledge regarding the subject. I strongly agree with the statement""It is more important for students to understand the ideas and the concept of the subject than it is for them to learn facts"". Students who go in the manner of understanding the idea of the subject and the purpose of the subject and how the subject is inter related with the other topics will get a good idea of the subject. Unless the student gets the idea of what the subject is and what the concept behind writing all these tasks in a subject it is used less for the student to do a course. A student who goes along with the idea and the concept of the subject gains a lot of grip on the subject and he may produce any thing regarding the subject on demand. For example,let us take a student who is having a subject in C language on his/her course,the student who first goes through the text book and gets the idea of the language and what the subject is and what is needed for programming in a C language can write a technical program for a small application based on C language. On the other hand the student who goes through the facts of the subject will not get the practical idea and he cant produce an application in C language. How can he produce an application with out knowing what is the main idea of the subject and what is the concept that outputs an application in C language. Even the student who is having a course in Maths in his academic year,if he goes along with the facts that are related to the subject how can he solve a problem related to the subject of mathematics. On the other hand the students who get the complete idea ragrading the idea and the concept of the subject can automatically solve the problem given. The first task is that the student should know what the idea is and after that he can go through the facts of the book and he also requires learning knowledge regarding the subject. Finally,i conclude that the student should go for the preparation of a subject in a manner of getting the idea regarding the subject and the concept regarding the subject.",Unless these two things the student ca not approach the practical way of the subject.,0

Secondly, young people do not generally have great and impellent responsibilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends, go dancing , practise known sports , stay up late without any problem. Moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems concentrating and remembering the things they learn. This problem can seriously affect their chances to learn new things by reading books, which I believe is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy yourself.

Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail. One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"". So above is cancer biology jargon saying that i am not able to understand how this can be modulated in a single step. Now check example and evaluate any person or rather an untellectual on the basis thathow can he or she have command of Many subjects? when a person is not able to get a command on a single topic of his choice. Also refining your knowledge could leave you with very nice career options as well because you can never be a lecturer of Physics and Bilology simultaneously. you have to go to one subject and can then only be able to achieve one pinnacle in that subject to make you proud one day. As we know in a scientist's profession you can get into one lab and work throughout your life and never change your field after getting or understanding that subject.","So ,It is always regrettable that one should have a grasp of knowledge rather than try your hands at many subjects and ultimately land on just a smattering of those many subjects.",0

People start to learn from when they are born. We have to learn language, ways of living, and many subjects in the school. I think the bigger knowledge is the better. It is good for people's minds, solving many problems simultaneously. First of all, knowing many things is helpful to someone's life. From learning many academic subjects, we can broaden our knowledge and common sense. Also, we can meet many people who study other fields, and speak to each other. Not only can we develop our social skills, but our thoughts are getting bigger. We can see other sides of society too. For example, there are many students who have a double major in my school. They can meet many students who have another major, and they know many professors. I think it is very helpful for students' futures. Furthermore, knowing many subjects, we can apply one thing to another. I think most subjects are related, and they have an influence on each other. If we know one subject accurately, it will help to understand other subjects. Hence, broad knowledge of many subjects is good for understanding many things. From my personal experience, when I was in high school, I solved many mathematics questions. From this process, I could also develop problem solving skills in society.

1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that.","Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold.",0

In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now.

1332963.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I agree with the statement. In many years, since cars were created and got on sale, people have used them and had them in their lives as their legs to go where they want to go. And cars also contribute to carrying stuff faster and easier, not just people. Today, cars are needed by the world and people's lives as I wrote. But you know what cars need to move. That is gas. People have also used a lot of gas along with cars since they started to drive cars. But it led to oil that creates gas to be used up from the underground of the earth faster. If people didn't touch it, it wouldn't happen. But the spending or waste of gas is still going on now. So, waste of oils is caused by using up of them. That is about why countries that have oil are making oil ( gas ) prices higher and higher. Then, who will need more cars that use gas even more than now in the future? Looking at the problem, scientists are trying to find or create new kinds of fuels to move the cars for gas.","For example, there is an interest in getting new fuels.",0
1299928.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statement that says ""successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. ""The reason why I agree with this statement is this. If successful people only do whatever they know very well, we will have around the world the same things. For example, cars, if people are eager to buy new models of cars, and they do not try to do something new, how boring, we do not have a lot of options, but because they take risks we have numerous options when we are looking for a car, you, me, everybody can buy all kinds such as: a BMW, a Jaguard, a Camry, a Jeep, etc. Also, people who want to start a new restaurant, the want to open something new. If in the area where they are going to build this new restaurant there are some Chinese, Greek, or Thai food, but they do not have real Mexican food, I think that the best thing they can do is start a restaurant that is not in this area. Another example is Fashion, women love fashion, they do not wear the same clothes, they change almost 365 days during the years. The new customers are fighting each other in order to have the best design, they are risking, but if the design is the best, they will get a good income. If you do not risk it, I am almost sure, you won't win. Take a risk and you will be successful in life.",In life we need to risk most of the time.,0
1114004.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products.","If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone.",0
358795.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I support this statement by giving reasons and examples in the following paragraphs. firstly,students should understand ideas and concepts because it makes them understand clearly and accurately. Understanding ideas and concepts of a particular topic makes their work fast and perfectly. For example suppose a student wants to give a seminar on the topic of spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and thoroughly. So that he or she can generate more ways of elaborating on the topic which can be helpful during the seminar. Secondly,learning the concepts makes a person more perfect in the topic which he is working on. so that he can generate new ways and methods. for example during the preparation of an experiment the scientist should know the concept of the experiment so that he can work well and avoid risks and harmfuleffects. Buy understanding the concepts and ideas clearly and correctly one develops more knowledge and data regarding the topic rather than learning facts. Thirdly,facts are the material which has been developed already which can not be developed further. but understanding an idea and concepts we can further discover and invent new ideas from the ideas we have. for example using the water and its properties scientists have developed the steamengine. Famous scientists who had developed the concept of numbersystem were clearly understood by aryabatta. He discovered the algebra using the numbersystem.",students should understand the main idea of the English reading passage so that they can answer the questions in the questionpaper.,0
54939.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the rise of capitalism as the dominant economic system around the world, advertising has emerged as one of the key elements of the economy, especially in the 20th century. Producers use advertising as a way of introducing a product to the customer, creating meanings around it, in order to distinguish their products from the other similar ones on the market, to make them compatible and attractive to their customers. There are different ways of promoting a particular product. Topday the advertisement sector has developed a variety of ways in order to promote a particular product. One of them is the evaluation of the qualities of the advertised product.","The purposes of the producers for advertising a product are not mainly to demonstrate the real characteristics of their products, but rather to be able to reach more customers and as many products as possible.",0
246766.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, advertisements have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product. All is studied to make it attractive, brilliant, colourful, nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful. It has occurred many times that the product was truly disappointing compared to the advertisement. Of course, it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as ""fabulous"" as they were supposed to be. I spent some money on various things, from CDs to a DVD player, beauty products for my sister or very diverse things, which happened to be smaller than they were said to be, less efficient or to break very easily. My brother, who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be. The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player, for example, is not as varied as it was written on the box. Apart from the high technology, I would tend to say that advertising does not lie so much about food products.","Is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it? We can buy a television once within a couple of years, be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority, it is different from the food advertisements, or the items we regularly need to buy.",0

997336.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ideas and concepts came from the facts. I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims. According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense. I usually convert the idea to fact by looking on the internet for facts about things that are related to the idea.","In comparison, students are different some of them like to learn things but others like to understandideas.",0

In my opinion, when a person invents something new which is not available on the market. He tries to include everything that he could do. This is a good thing. But when the time comes for advertising this product. The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he can get profits as fast as he can. Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones. When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give. Like to give a mobile phone headset, a car charger, a mobile phone carry case, some applications, games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones. When a customer looks at this kind of advertisement he gets really excited. He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw in the advertisement.","Then the shop keeper shows him, he does not like the item.",0
475475.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them. If old people do not use them, they can not catch up with the social change. So we teach how to use them in a community center. Moreover, we can learn about Japanese culture and customs from old people. Most of our parents work together and come back late. And we do not live with grandparents.",Many children have not a chance to learn about old Japanese culture.,0

Ofcourse, some people think that without facts it won't take too long to find out, but what if they didn't know if they were right. To put it this way, say that you want to learn something in biology in plants, animals, fish, reptiles, insects and mammels. To know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book, you can read through the main facts and details that were given to you. If you want to know something or investigate you need the facts about each topic that you were given in your biology book. If you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem.","Also, another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened example, who killed someone or who is the one responsible for committinga crime.",0
1830076.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I guess a lot of people had the same problem: You are reading an article about an impressive building (like the Pyramids) and you do not understand how it was built and how hot it was able to resist all the time. In case you understand the idea or concept of the building, you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings. In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind. In this essay I want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas. Firstly, you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea. In case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim. Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea. Secondly, you are able to improve the concept. If you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable.

1055965.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"People have a lot of time and energy to do things when they are young. Whatever they do, young people have many more chances to do better than older people. Young people have a lot more possibilities to do enjoyable things. First of all, there are good chances of success doing things when people are young. People who succeeded in their lives usually had busy and tiring but enjoyable lives ; they were motivated and ready enough to do what they were supposed to and wanted to do. Most people who fail in their lives usually regret that they did not use their time efficiently to have enough time to enjoy themselves. Therefore, It is proved from the general lives of people that young people have chances to enjoy their lives. Also, everyone knows that they can do a lot of things when they are young.","One day, when my father and I were talking, my father said that he thinks I am lucky because I can do a lot of things which my father can not do now.",0
1476017.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are several reasons why I agree with this statement. First, I think that understanding an idea and a concept is the first step to learning something new. For example, if you do not know the concept of ""evaporation"" how are you going to know the ""process of raining"" or maybe understand some chemical process that involves the concept of ""evaporation"". Secondly, I agree that students must know every concept of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challenges without knowing the facts. For example, if a student knows the concept of ""bowling something"" , then it would be easier for him to cook something by just following the instruction. Finally, I support this thanks to a personal experience I had.

477986.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts. Therefore the amount of money is a very important aspect of human life. Everybody has different points of views about how they must earn the money. Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger. Burger King advertisements are the most popular examples for the curious consumers to find out about their consumer rights. Last but not least, being the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the price of your product. For instance Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market. So they are able to change the price of their products, Ipod, freely. How did they become the main producer? With advertisements actually.","They presumed their product would survive for 2 years, but after ten months it was almost broken down.",0

However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products.

1698141.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Twenty Years Later? It is considered that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This statement may become true or false, because it is a guess but why did people believe in that guess or not. First of all I strongly believed in that statement. As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy. As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased. so people will choose to travel by bus, subway or unbelievable but expected by plane. Because of improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles. I think it is an obvious choice: if you have the chanceto go to your work by subway; you will go to your work by subway. That is why; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling. On the other hand people's choices will change while travelling along the cities; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropolis city to a tourist city in Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car. Because for making another guess; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all. Time is a valuable thing now; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay for a plane ticket for not being late for life. In all these respects above; transportation will see great changes in the aspect of people'slives.",These changes will be rooted from the improvements in transportation vehicles and economic conditions for instance in the fuel oil people face.,0

1832754.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The studies I do reveal that I prefer to get a general knowledge of how the world runs, how society works, than to specialize in a particular academic subject. Indeed, I am following undergraduate classes in an Institute of Political Studies, which provide a very large panel of courses, from economics to history, or sociology, international relationships, geopolitics, etc. But, recently I decided to integrate a master's which concentrates on business courses. Following my experience, I would say that every student should choose different academic subjects during his undergraduate program, but on the other hand should narrow its selection when he or she integrates a graduate program. Actually, I really think the more you are becoming a specialist in a subject, the more you will be likely to be hired by whatever company or organisation it may be. And I must insist on this point : the final aim of the studies is to give you all the elements you will need to face the rough reality of the job market. It must be, eventually, a help to use in the better way your personality and your skills while working. But this might appear as a bit restrictive to you as studies are also a means to learn things and to get a general knowledge.

One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law. One of my friends, Tanaka, is the best student studying economics and has a lot of knowledge of the bank system. He helped me. I was able to learn a lot of things about bank law. As the example shows, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient.

First, I think they can succeed because they have already taken their risk, it is all risk out side the world, each thing has a risk but seems to big or small. For example, if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be an accident on you. Taking risks is a must. The mean of success is they know how to do things well, A human being has a tendency to learn more to find out new things. Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve. Successful people know that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up with them. They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what the world needs so they can do it.","Although many people think successful people are selfish, just doing things they like or they want, they won't share with others, but I think it is only other people who don't understand what they are thinking.",0

1166105.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"So different are personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions. As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better. Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions. This example can tell you right. The light came out soon after the invention of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or relation. As a result, successful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one. This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going, but stay behind. However, I dont want to overstate the advantage of my agreement, since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some scientific cases. Firstly, when people try to invent new things, it takes a long time to achieve the achievement.","Secondly, 	To sum up, according the to above mentioned reasons and examples, successful people should try new things and take, becoming becomes more convincing to me, although it has some own negative aspects which we can not deny.",0

But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors.",But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so.,0
1031452.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Nowadays we live in a very competitiveworld. We are being inundated by advertisements everyday. We see them on tv, on the radio and they are even taking over the streets. But how much of those products being advertised actually work?. What's more, are they really as good as they seem to be in the advertisement?. Sometimes you are watching TV and you see something that seems to do wonders in the kitchen, wonders about cleaning, a product that does the laundry, cleans the dog and also washes the car. You just have to buy it. But sometimes when you do it and you try it a few times you keep thinking: ""but this didn't happen on TV"". Thats because on tv they only show us what we want to see. They dont put on air if its hard to use, or dangerous for the kid. they put that on the box, in tiny black letters. And it did happen to me when I bought an ""all-in wonder"" blender. In the world of advertising it's all about appearances. Most people are being suggested by those advertisements to buy the product because the people that sell it only show the good side of it. Also to sell it they have to make it look spectacular on the eye, because nobody buys an ugly box. All the effort is focused on making it look attractive, not where it should be: quality. Companies are more interested in making more money by making the product more attractive to the eye, than making the product efficient, safe, and good. Its a constant battle between quality vs costs, and unfortunately, these days that battle is won by costs, because it gives more money to the company that makes the product. In conclusion, our globalized world is more interested in making a product more profitable than reliable.","We live in a ""use it and lose it"" world.",0
1314208.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people think students should learn the result of facts. Even though that is important for students, I myself believe comprehension of ideas and concepts are more necessary for modern life. People are able to manage their skills in their life easily. For example, when a person knows how to figure out math concepts, the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programming field. If the person wants to be a computer programmer, the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business. Learning facts is risky to interfere with students' motivation. It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover themselves to solve the problems. For example, in math class students always spend a lot of time considering to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process helps students to make motivation for studying.","Finally, learning only results is not always true.",0
1484958.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Now the world is changing so fast and technology, too. the material need has become very important for people, whatever food, entertainment and spiritual life. People want to get more things from life. People use a lot of ideas to create the things that they want. However, we know most adversisements make products seem much better than they really are. Many companies have made many DM and advertisements to attract their customers. For the company, they just want people to buy their products. The advertisements are just a way to present their thoughts. However, the real product is not really like the advertisement. The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thoughts to their customers. Maybe they did not talk about how to use the products any more. They want the climents to keep their eyes on them. That is business. On the other hand, now there are many companies that sell their stuff in the TV show. They provide the time to use their products.",If the customer does like the products that they can return to the company.,0
1569573.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination. of course every idea can be based onfacts. but sometimes it's wrong because students have to try to think of things someyears ago. many schools force students to study with formulas and memorize only facts. they didn't allow students to speak their opinions freely. but these days, many systems have changed in school. they encourage students' creative activity.",when childhood is important to students they don't know much about society and the future and around many things.,0
1886379.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge. There are three reasons why I think that. First of all , It will be very boring to study one subject for a long time. In fact , you might get totally exhausted and you might even lose interest in that subject. For example, students who are good at calculation study math for a long time and would also like to change the studying subject to a subject that can be read without using your hands or brain. Secondly, you can know what you are really interested in when you study a bit of various subjects. This is the reason why education doesn' t focus on a specific subject and it can also make up the choice of what we really like about a student after a long time of basic education till high school. For example, we decide what major we want to study after entering universities. We can decide by the interests we developed since we started elementary school. Furthermore, I believe with the advantage of learning everything a bit gives more opportunities to choose various jobs. we can use our broad knowledge instead of one specific idea to apply jobs we want in the future.","For example , people who want to study hotel management when they apply to their universities.",0
549479.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"In our western society, where the individual plays a central role, the community appears to be less and less important, although There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist. Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community.",External factors explain that.,0
1605992.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I strongly agree with the statement, as i personally experience the feeling. In life we need to enjoy every part, though it is related to money, adventure, drama etc. Elders are always frightened as they always think of the future rather than the present. But youngsters are really bothered about the future. For example when i am at school i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me, but finally they sent me with more caution. After comming back, they saw my video of my bangee jump on tour and started scolding me though i safely came back. They are always more curious in life and they never try for any adventure. I feel adventure is also part of enjoyment. Spending money is economy for elderly people but for young people money doesnt matter for enjoyment. when i started earning, i started spending for my own expenses, like restaurants, outings with friends, enjoying weekends, but my parents did nt like this as they wanted me to save money for my future. I feel that we need to enjoy it when we have the opportunity, as time never comes back. We can earn money through out our life. Youngsters like dressing in a modern way as per their comfort whereas elderly people feel that young people need to maintain their tradition but i feel dressing in modern does not mean that we are loosing our tradition.",Finally i conclude that thinking of all these elderly people is loosing all enjoyments whereas young people are enjoying more than them.,0
1053764.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays young people don't spend their time helping their communities. In my opinion young people should be more involved in their communities. Young people should deal with the problems of their communities. Nevertheless, young people have to deal with many problems related to their life. As a consequence, they don't have time to help their communities. On the one hand, I believe that young people should try to eliminate the negative aspects of their society. On the other hand, I think that the communities must understand the young people's problems and try to solve them. Young people have a lot of problems during their life. In particular, they have social problems. For example, they have difficulties having relationships and they are not able to relate with society. As a result they prefer to stay alone. Furthermore, in many cases young people during their studies must find absolutely a job. Young people after work want to spend their time with their friends or family. Moreover sometimes young people disagree with the decisions taken by their communities.",As a consequence they do to want to help them.,0

1752779.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yes , I completely agree with the statement "" YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO"". We live our lives to our fullest when we are young, leaving behind the worries and the intricacies of old age. So i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energetic, with young minds fresh from college, with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out. ""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better than younger people. But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world.","The older people have minds that are worn out, by age , by time.",0
323858.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view it is right. Being more successful is important for successful people and they used to choose this way. It is a paradox but it is also a law of nature.",But some people only do that.,0
980298.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","A few years ago, the car was a really expansive thing to own by one person. It is because of payment of all the employees as well as their economic problems. In a few years, the materials which are used in cars were quite expensive and to make them they did not have machines to build these cars and they were making the cars by human beings' hand. In a few years, our world has got so many machines and their' improvements, cars are one of them as well. This helped to people to build up many mechanical things such as cars, buildings, computers or even children's activities. This also affected our relationships and the way we met new people that we never imagined, it did affect the children's world as well. Since those computer games or GameBoy came out, they have stopped going around their houses, stopped running and hanging out with their friends outside of their houses, instead of these things stopping, they started to play inside their houses and stayed in their rooms, did not come out from there and they became much weaker because of these computer games. However, because of those technological improvements, people have started to get cars for each person much easier than before. The cost of cars is getting lower and lower, and car companies try to make and sell them as cheaply as possible with lots of benefits. So, I disagree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today but, ""the problems with it"" is we might finish all the oil we have now and we can not use cars in thefuture. However, we are making new style of cars that run on battery, which means they are not going to use oil any more instead of using a battery.

People who make ideas for advertisements always try to find creative and impressive ideas. In my view, it can't be avoided for companies to make products seem much better than they really are in their advertisements. There are so many advertisements in the world and companies want people to be interested in their products. Besides, to make interesting advertisements, they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points. First, most advertisements are made to grab people's eyes. For example, we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on TV. However, they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences. But every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently from others, because they need to grab people's eyes. And it will be connected right away with their selling. Also, the advertisements have to show only good points to people instead of short points. We don't have any of those kinds of rules.

First, we can easily find a good example through the system of education. You go to elementary school and start to study there. Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story.

Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly.

There are some points of views that students already participate in enough communities. However, in my opinion this cannot be true in terms of. In this essay. I will briefly present two reasons supporting my opinion. Most of all, individualism causes young people nowadays not to concern themselves about their communities. Most families in this country have one or two children, and they cannot have a chance to experience cooperation. They grew up only with their parents and without any siblings so it is hard to know how to share or yield for others that can learn from a large family. As a result, these children tend to behave individually and do not think about others who need help. This is the main reason why I think young people hardly help others in their communities. Moreover, schools and other organizations require students to do something for society without their own will. What I mean is that this requirement has a bad influence on students. It may help students spend at least time volunteering but they will avoid helping others because of this rule, which is essential to go to a good school or get a better job in our country. In my opinion, helping someone that they don't want to do makes them not do any volunteer work except required time.","Therefore, rules that have to.",0

1928452.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially those who would like to make a success in their life, discuss whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just keep what they already have a knowledge to make a better life. I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life. For example, the SamSung company which is specialized in the electronic field such as TV, computers and semiconductor products worldwide has been researching new markets and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result, it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people. If the company still enjoyed stability, today's successful story would not exist. Further more, the companies which exploit the well of crude oil always try to find new resources by investing large amounts of money with huge risks. For these efforts, it deserved to get a lot of reputation and accumulate a fortune. Secondly, stability of today's life means returning to the past in this capitalism. Everyday, new information is revealed to the public and every individual must have a radar to catch it. For example, the auto maker company tries to new design to meet the customers' needs in the market However, they do not make an effort to make a new design of cars, the company will lose the people's consumption. By doing so, new investment and new design should be tried to keep the reputation and successful story. In addition, if a member of a computer program company has knowledge of the old version, he will lose his job and even previous skill. For these reasons, I strongly believe that people want to have a successful life, they must have a sense of challenge and must realize the stability of today's life will ruin them in modern society.","In order to succeed, we should review the international successfully company's st.",0

But enjoying life is not only limited by doing sport or showing the strength of your body.

976282.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"in my opinion successful people have always succeeded when they have taken the risk. behind every successful man or company there is a huge amount of risk involved. some people even believe that there is no fun without risk. for example if gandhi hadn't taken the risk of his life and continued his work as a lawyer in south africa,india wouldnt have been an independent country today. So, for every successful mission to take place a risk has to be involved. all the leading business companies in the world take a major risk when they invest in a new project. the new projects may or may not do well and the company might run into losses. but most successful people are ready to take this risk and most of them are successful in their plans. over the years the risk factor has been taken into consideration by all leading men and they take the risk into account even before they take up a business. but its annoying to know that these people who are mostly successful when they have taken the risk or taken a chance have been successful otherwise today we wouldnt be connected to the entire world through the internet if the risk was not taken. we wouldn't have been doing so much with the computer if bill gates hadn't taken the risk and invested so much in only developing computers and its software.",people who are successful in share markets are prone to huge risks and losses but all the leading men in share companies take risks and are successful also.,0

1923351.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my view, success depends on the area where he is working t. So, i believe ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is true in some cases and it is not better in some other cases. Firstly, taking a sports man in to consideration he should adopt some new methods to improve his skills in his game rather than trying for some other games. so here the sports man is suggested to carry his carrier on the same field without going to other fields and taking risks. On the other hand ,let us see how success comes from new things. For example,white brothers invented aeroplanes as they were new to the world they were praised by the world. And later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplanes are not so much praised as the white brothers. This is because the basis and the idea is given by the white British and the others have just made some modifications. Those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extent that the white brothers got. the people who follow the procedure given by others may not get success as much as the people who give the basic idea. we should note that going for new things gives success but it may or may not be changing the field of interest. In the software field they need to change their domain frequently to give their best outputs. So here they need to try new things and take risks. They need to change from one domain to another very frequently.","In conclusion, success is given if it is new and it doesn't matter whether it is his new area or not.",0

In the world, many successful people exist such as Bill Gates, Lee Gun-Hee who is Samsung's CEO. So then if they didn't try new things, can we live like this convenient life now? Of course not. The other example is a soccer player who is Ronaldo. If Ronaldo did not try new skills, could he become a world star and get the love of fans? These questions are based on my opinion that will be explained. Do you know the proverb that ""No pain, No gain""? It is the best sentence for me in my whole life. If Successful people don't want to take risks, it is freedom for them. But they can not get more fame or what they want. For example, Bill Gates became the richest person in the world. Because he makes Windows 95. So did he stop development? No, he is developing now such as Windows XP, Vista. The other example is BMW and Mercedes BENZ. They are the best automobile company in the world. If they sell their cars, those cars become the trend and symbol of wealth. But they don't stop development. They will make hybrid cars for the environment. Nobody knows that hybrid cars will succeed. Although BMW and Mercedes BENZ may have taken risks, they did.

1717762.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In the world, there are so many cars that people can use them for transportation. It is necessary because of illness. When one of the family members becomes ill, she needs a car. That's why an ambulance may not come immediately. However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home. They also don't go out for this reason. Moreover, telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jams. As long as people work these jobs. There aren't any traffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason. In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads. Besides telecommuting and air pollution, cars are expensive because of technology. When we look at the past, cars are more developed than in the past. Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future. Moreover, For instance, I work in a job, but my earnings are not enough to buy a car. Hence, I can not afford to buy the most developed cars. In conclusion, In the future, I think that people don't want to purchase automobiles for these reasons. Therefore, people should prevent these problems.",I consider no cars and no problems for the future.,0
1843663.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is important that everybody enjoys their lives. But who enjoys it more, young people or older people? In my opinion, older people enjoy their lives more because they know what true enjoyment and freedom to do anything is. Firstly, adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what true enjoyment is. Youngsters call playing computer games, going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life. However it is too small to be an enjoyment inone's life. Older people enjoy their lives in a greater range. For example, the head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit, directing people and going to dinner with his family, which are far more enjoyable than playing computer games. Secondly, adults have the freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy. For youngsters to enjoy their lives, there are numerous things that are not permitted to do, such as drinking, traveling without parents. However, there is no such barrier for adults. For example, my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business. Then he told me that he would go to these beautiful places and would come back with a better future.","I, after listening to him, immediately thought of all the stress that I was getting from school and planned a trip alone.",0
1097795.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being makes it easy to succeed in their common life. First, usually successful people attract more successful people. For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends. That is, this meeting provides them with the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and these kinds of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove themselves and normally, they are going to win, the people tell us that they are lucky people. It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance. Second, two important motors of human beings' behaviour are motivation and emotion. These people are really motivated to get new experiences, learnings and knowledge. And even, this behaviour makes them pleasure by increasing some chemical substances in their brain. For example, taking new risks, such as changing the location of living, taking a new job and meeting new colleagues are really activities that pleasure them. They are moved by their motivation and emotion in order to achieve their goals and to become satisfied with them and their environment. Finally, I think that success in life, that is, reaching their goals, can be got by trying new things and taking new risks. These actions enlarge a person's knowledge and information increases the critical perception of the world. people try new things and take risks to become successful people.",Successful people try new experiences.,0
1075656.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing. Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives.",In a way positively impacted us by being able to find a lot of things on the internet and make it easier for all ages to find things they would like.,0

1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years. Considering the facts it may be a good thing, if there were fewer cars, this would help our environment get healthier again.",Even so the need and lack of alternatives will not chance the amount of cars during the next twenty years.,0

Admittedly, with the complete development of the public transportation system such as the development of underground transportation, the system will obtain larger capacity , which would be a replacement to the use of cars.

543465.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"yes i agree with the statement because they will have the dare to implement their innovative skills after one success. They always try to do something better and more useful than the others. They will never go with the things which have been done before but they will change or add some more features for those which have been done by them earlier. The successful people will also take the ideas of others which will be useful for them. They always go with the concept of "" TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU SUCCEED"". This is the major concept used by many successful people because they wo not leave the thing that they want to do. For example i would like to consider Mr. DARREN BUFFET, one of the richest people in the world. At first he was a cool drink seller after that he invested some money in the stock market he went into theloss side. Even though he was on the losing side he did not change the track on which he was really interested.

43322.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In Japan, where I live, many people may think that there will be more cars in use in the future. However, I support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years for the following reasons. First, the price of energy will become higher than today. For example, many people prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy. Many car makers are making their efforts to produce cars which need not so much energy, though, such cars are high cost. In addition, there is difficulty in developing new laws that cost energy. As the above explanation demonstrates, in the future, people will use fewer cars than there are today. Second, environmental problems change people's way of thinking about traffic methods. For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city environmental problems are so serious. Originally Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had not so much a train network. However, the South Korean government improved the capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people. The government will continue such efforts to make Seoul's air clean. Trains seem to replace the car-centric traffic system. As the above example demonstrates, there will be fewer cars today. Third, the reasons people buy cars are more limited than before. The car is not only a means of transport but also a symbol of rich life. However, people will change such an image of cars. For example, in European countries, where many people use cars for the first time in the world, simple cars are popular because many Europeans think cars are just a traffic method. In the old days, people in Europe loved rich cars, though, such thinking is changing. In such a situation, they don't need so many cars if there is other traffic system such as trains.",As the above example shows.,0
1446679.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main character, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with. therefore, he becomes furious at not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide. This is a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when you are young. I think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest, whether young or old, by doing the things he enjoys doing the most.","That is when he can reach a mental satisfaction, by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life which is to enjoy life.",0
115632.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The given statement is ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"". I disagree with the above statement because, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems to be alright when in childhood, but this seems to be complex and cumbersome as we grow older and older. Firstly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly. For example, consider a high school student. If he needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school, apart from his personal interest which he shows in a particular subject, the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome. Secondly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, the frequency at which we do get updates about these subjects greatly matters. We need to have a greater frequency of updation in all areas, which is not a simpler task. For example, consider a student studying Computer Sciences.","The other academic subjects include some main aspects from Electronics, Electricals, Communications and, likewise.",0

''I will give three main reasons why I think there will be more cars in twenty years from now. First of all in twenty years, the Earth's population, will tend to be almost nine billion people, which is an overpopulation of course, so I think the more people there are the more cars there are. To continue, people usually prefer to take a car rather than to walk, now we can say that some of them will take public transport, but after all, a bus, is only a big car. Whereas other facilities, are not really developed in all countries , and people usually prefer going in a private car rather than in a public facility.

By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented java,we can't understand the features ofjava. we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts. facts can also Improve knowledge.

By learning the facts we can prevent wars like the second world war and the first world war. by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods, It was very interesting. last week some of the people found the Dwaraka under the sea, so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were Dwaraka in the past.

935619.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The question has been asked whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for them to learn facts. In my opinion, understanding is definitely more important because it gives the students a chance to explore, a chance to be creative and an unforgettable result. Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topic allows students to go through the investing process. For example, telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor, similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing. Instead, it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literature and find out for themselves that certain techniques add to the perfection of writing. Understanding how they work would give students a better lesson.

1110971.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs.",Their falling apart would be fatal.,0

Many people may hold the issue to learn as much as specialized knowledge in one specific subject and think that is a prime argument. But, some people, however, are taking a fresh look at it. As far as I am concerned, I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic  subjects, although there may be several merits to specializing in one specific subject, for example, more expertized and more deeply knowledge. Among countless reasons that influence my opinion, there are three conspicuous aspects that follow. We may look into every possible reason, however, the foremost one is that broad knowledge is good for fitting into the development of the world today. Nowadays, people can get as much information from many different methods. They should have the ability to be familiar with huge amounts of information and treat it correctly. And if they want to reach that level mentioned above they must have a lot of different knowledge of a great number of subjects.","Also, it may be arbitrary to judge my preference only by using the argument mentioned in the above paragraph.",0

As the cars appeared, some diseases and pollution appeared. The sweat fume will increase the rate of catching heart or lung diseases. Moreover, we can not breathe the fresh air today. That is a terrible situation which means we can not have a better health than before. Besides, traffic jams are another problem we need to be concerned  about.

838581.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Nowadays, most young people don't know what misery is. I'm talking about countries like France, the USA or Germany, and so on. Countries that are rich. When you have everything you need, you can not imagine that you could help people who would love to have your help. I agree that nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their colleagues. But this is not true only for young people. Nowadays, in our society, everyone thinks about him before someone else. It's called 'selfish'. And i definitely can not agree with this because even if we have the chance to leave in a rough country, poverty exists. Young people and also adults have to pay attention to their community. But if we want young people to help, adults have to show an example. We must have a lot of people who help each other because it is so much easier to live this way. First, when you help someone, you bring him so much happiness that he will feel much better quickly, and you give yourself a good satisfaction by doing it. But the man, or woman you did help will do it for someone else. And this other person for another, and so on. By the way, if you think about this, by helping each other, this is all society who will feel better,and if there are more people doing this, after a while, fewer people will need help. I know it's not possible to solve everyone's problem, but it's a dream that can come true. There are 6 billion people on Earth, so is it better to have 6 billion people who don't care except themselves, or is it better to have 6 billion people who are crew. I will finish like this.

Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities, but it's not very often. I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time on their communities is the school rules. In high school and college they have a kind of rule -like homework- that a student has to help his or her community at list 10 hoursper year. We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities.

I have three major reasons to say that. One of them is that newer types of car are being produced and the second is that transportation by car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that have to be made for people to transport The first reason for not agreeing with the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of car are being produced. These types include cars which work with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things. There are also plans to create cars which are flying near to the surface and this will provide a place for some more cars. The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars is very huge. There are other ways of transportation for example planes. They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople. Nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country advances. Cars are effective for transportation for many people The third reason for not agreeing with this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes. They should be very expensive changes, that are needed to compensate for the need for transportation of the increasing population of the world. Installing a new system is required and for this system many new research should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again.

They are freer than before, they have more rights: politically, the individual aspect is more developed in this generation than in previous generations can we say young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities? I disagree with this statement because I think young people are under the influence of globalisation. I think we cant say young people dont give enough time to helping their communities since young people are working for global problems like individual rights of all people in the world, human rights, environmental problems or food supply like in African countries so the concept of their country disappears and young people are thinking of a global viewpoint. Another reason for my dissatisfaction is that young people are first educated in their countries. Later they are working in their countries with their colleagues. This is the beginning of their professional life starts in their home country and then later, most of them start to work for international companies which are the result of theglobal economy.

People generally always want to go to either the new place or the place which they have gone to before because they want to know in detail about that place. Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group. However, I personally prefer that when I go in a group, it must be led by the tour guide. Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups. They make some funny statements, and sometimes jokes. Sometimes, the information is real but it is conveyed in a group such a way that everybody laughs. For example, I went to visit a museum, i. e Tajmahal in India. This tajmahal is built by the Sahjaha in love of the wife. Everytime our tour guide asked us what our husband would make for us in future. He said to the man that he would not build this kind of monument which means you donot like your wife.

I mean, a lot of knowledge and information is produced everyday, so people who want to succeed have to be available to learn new things every day. Some researchers have found that people must change their major aor career once in their life. Second, in business there are a lot of stories where people that don't take a risk and take a chance, lose a lot of money.

Others, like me, believe that a few hours every week must be used to help the communities. I would support my view with a couple of reasons. First of all, living in Italy, I know that most of the young people in my country work or study not more than eight hours a day. Other people, like Chinese people, work for at least 12 hours a day and they have not time to do other activities after they have finished studying or working.

It is necessary because of illness. When one of the family members becomes ill, she needs a car. That's why an ambulance may not come immediately. However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home. They also don't go out for this reason. Moreover, telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jams. As long as people work these jobs. There aren't any traffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason. In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads.

So I wouldn't expect them to work less effectively during the next twenty years.

The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up.

On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them. The second compromise would be with the environment, trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but, of course, trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to pollution problems But on the other hand , we can also view the coin by the other face. Even if technology can be improved during the next twenty years, it will be very difficult for normal people to achieve all the advances. In that case, in the non-developed countries and maybe in many developing countries, cars could keep their own place as the main means of transport.

To go somewhere with my friends, to go shopping with my family, to chat with unknown people on the Internet, to find pictures, to find friends, and more whatever. Some of them are needed to young power. Some older people can do these things. But when I become an older person, I think I can't do these things. Because I will lose power. I might be tired early.",I know I will become like my thinking.,0
1067059.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the statement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than going for many. Firstly it is not fashionable to have a command on many subjects ,,if you want to really engender this prodigy then you may land on no mans land. And if you select any specific field like Biotechnology, then you can have many things to back its knowledge through involving yourself in many pertinent fields like Molecular Biology , Immunology etc, constituting a part Of Biotechnology but if you want to study Biotechnology with Physics then how can you formulate your concept in those different fields? Also if you have a command of one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up with naive steps to really improve the current state of that particular subject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,,and mind you it will take atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject,, So, one needs to go for his subject of his choice like Chemistry , Physics, Dynamics, fluid mechanicsetc. and take that along in his or her carrer so as to make that his only subject and having a grasp of that subject in detail.","One Professor In the Cancer Biology field spends 30 years of research and then too he says at his 60 years of age and 30 years of hard core research experience that he still cannot confidently say what is the "" what is the real cause of uncontrolled check points in the cell cycle"".",0

1659151.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"First, we have to identify what a successful person is. In a general way, it is somebody who realizes something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way. Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful? Is it necessary to show all those virtues to be successful? Is it the only condition to be successful? On the one hand, successful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful. So, it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful. On the other hand, somebody may have a lot of virtues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized. It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like BASE jumping, but without being outstanding and recognized, this person is not yet successful, only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful. The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those virtues. First, a successful person can show only one of those virtues and be successful.",Somebody creating a new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks.,0
1166105.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"So different are personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions. As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better. Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions. This example can tell you right.","The light came out soon after the invention of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or relation.",0

358795.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I support this statement by giving reasons and examples in the following paragraphs. firstly,students should understand ideas and concepts because it makes them understand clearly and accurately. Understanding ideas and concepts of a particular topic makes their work fast and perfectly. For example suppose a student wants to give a seminar on the topic of spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and thoroughly. So that he or she can generate more ways of elaborating on the topic which can be helpful during the seminar. Secondly,learning the concepts makes a person more perfect in the topic which he is working on. so that he can generate new ways and methods. for example during the preparation of an experiment the scientist should know the concept of the experiment so that he can work well and avoid risks and harmfuleffects. Buy understanding the concepts and ideas clearly and correctly one develops more knowledge and data regarding the topic rather than learning facts. Thirdly,facts are the material which has been developed already which can not be developed further.",but understanding an idea and concepts we can further discover and invent new ideas from the ideas we have.,0
735597.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life. Nowadays, schools are almost every where in the world, where people would try to get as much education as possible, so they can be the top person. Almost all modern schools teach many subjects to the students, such as Maths, science and history. However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better.","Not only is information going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future.",0

Young people have good health, a strong body and they are very active. Young people have good health and they don't need to spend time in the hospital and taking medicine. They enjoy their time doing many interesting things such as swimming, travelling , football and so on.

929457.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to try to reach good lifestyle standards therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things. Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrast, some think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well. I actually agree with the first idea. these are my following reasons Firstly,success is related toresponsibility. When successful people try new things and take risks they trust their responsible characteristics. For example i know a professor who is so successful at his job. Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to them.",In addition to this he never leaves his jobs because ofluck.,0
360807.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people think that it is better to learn about lots of subjects instead of specializing in one specific subject. I prefer the second posture, studying one specific subject. I think like this because I would like to be the best person in the world to deal with my future job. If everyone thought like me, there wouldn't be a competition to get job posts. I prefer to do my best in the subject I like, rather than performing not so well in many academic subjects. This decision should be well thought by everyone. If we want to have a perfect world we should dedicate ourselves very hard to the subject we like. In my opinion, when somebody finishes his or her career and has the doubt of having a master's in that subject or studying another thing to broaden his or her knowledge, the decision should be the first one mentioned. Having broad knowledge has its advantages too. For instance, if some one needed help, you would be able to give him a piece of advice, but this piece of advice won't be the same one given by a specialist in the subject. To sum up, I think in the world there should exist people with both types of knowledge, so as to complement themselves in a good way. But, I think that there is more need for specialists than for people with broad knowledge. This does not mean that specialists will know only about his subject.","Then, when he finishes his Master's, he can incorporate knowledge of other types of subjects in a different way.",0
73721.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do? yes, i agree with this opinion. Obviously, today we enjoy our lives more than the older generation, because we face a different time. First, with the development of our society, young people have more chance to learn about different life on this planet through TV programs, the internet or other media. A young man always has a great interest in new things. They like to enjoy different life and are eager to get more amazing experiences. For example, in china so many older people spend so much time caring for their grandchildren, or staying at home to watch TV. They always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again. but for young people, they can invite some friends to climb a mountain or drive a car to someplace, even though they have not much money. They do not want to waste their time when they are young. Second, as we all know, in china the older generation must work harder and harder, because our parents were not rich and they must earn more money to support their family. they spent their time working. when they want to enjoy the rest of life, they have already had no time or no interest in anything. but now so many young people have been born into good families, they can enjoy their life as they want, because their family can afford their consumptions. In recent years, so many young boys have been sent abroad to study by their parents. under the help of their parents, they can enjoy a new life in foreign countries, they can do anything if they want to.",There is a big difference between young generations and older generations in china.,0
562974.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I disagreen that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are three opinions in my mind to talk about why i disagree with this statement. At the beginning of the statement, I think one of the important reasons that people can be successful is because successful people have already done this thing as they are successful ,they use more time than other people , they continue their work all day , not give it up,so they are successful. It is not too easy to be successful for every successful person. Second, successful people do the same as other people. They just have more experiences than other people , At this time, they would have many experiencesto fair when they do this thing but nobody knows it. Successful people are not cleverer than other people,only harder working than other people. Third, new things not only have already been tried to , they need more time to think and to get some information to find some notes about them,successful people can not try new things when they have not already.","Therefore, they change some opinions which they already know how to do well.",0

1581339.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks. The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal, he wants to have something new and more difficult to do. Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succeeded in something, he will always want more. Alpinists, for example, don't usually stop climbing after they manage to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other mountain , harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conqueror, didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finally defeated. And I think because he was successful for the first time, he couldn't get rid of his willpower. An other reason would be the fact that successful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships. Well, he is now looking forward to becoming a Formula one driver.",Because he wants something new.,0

People can find the advertisements not only on the TV, but also in the newspapers. Furthermore, people buy many things because of the advertisements. The advertisements always look really good and make people want to spend money on them. In my opinion, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are the owners want to earn money, and the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated. The first reason is because the owners want to earn money from these commodities. For instance, if the advertisements look really terrible, no one would want to buy them and spend their money on them. Therefore, the owners willn't get any money and welfare from them. Secondly, most of the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated. For example, the iPOD is really fashionable these days. The iPOD advertisements always say that it can contain over 1,000 songs and won't run out of batteries at least 14 hours.","However, after I spent my money that came from my salary for a part time job, I was really sad about that.",0

People generally always want to go to either the new place or the place which they have gone to before because they want to know in detail about that place. Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group. However, I personally prefer that when I go in a group, it must be led by the tour guide. Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place. Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money. Secondly, tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups. They make some funny statements, and sometimes jokes. Sometimes, the information is real but it is conveyed in a group such a way that everybody laughs.

Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world.

1142118.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In many situations, as human beings, people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occur once in a while. Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step to leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into a --- normal person. From not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life. To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But, when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists? This is because of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus, finally he got the Nobel prize for his achievements. Not only, will he be remembered but his work of investment and achievement on the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of society. Further more, a famous French writer called ""Silva Plyth"" is famous for the poems that she wrote, the sadness and emotions through her poems; by reading her poems, emotions and a sense of sadness would soon arise. She is not any different from any other poet but, the only aspect which is different would make her so famous, is the fact that her uses of metaphor and the descriptions of surroundings are known to be so precise and carry a sense of shady cloud through reading her work.

However, in the final analysis, I conclude that the former one does make sense. In the following discussion, I would like to present some points to support my statement. In the first place, the key point for my view is that understanding ideas and concepts, undoubtedly, which allow the students to cultivate their ability to self-study, plays the most important role in their studies. Actually, the final aim of the students' studies at university is to promote their sense of independence. For example, in their beginning studies, they need a teacher to guide them. But in their future studies, they must deal with the problems by themselves. Of course, they need to practise their ability to solve the problem when they understand ideas and concepts in class. In addition, the students can understand ideas and concepts by themselves to check out what they have learnt in the class. It is a benefit for them to build up their self-confidence. Furthermore, It is the best way to supervise the students.","If they couldn't understand and understand concepts, they would fail the exam at last.",0

However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it.

1071641.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Many people in the world try to enjoy their life. However some people think older people can not enjoy life, but that is just a stereotype. Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do, such as knitting, watching movies, planting their own gardens. Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to the flowershop and looked for the special flower seeds. And when he got back home, he sprayed the water on the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it. The second reason is that not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots offriends. In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the trip was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend time with their friends and enjoy the time with them. Forthose reasons, old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. In particular my grandfather and grand mother, they really love their life.

Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work.

1972003.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","""Need is the mother of invention"" When needs change the things which are commonplace today change like a dream. Alternative solutions are found with inventions. So though it may sound strange after looking at the ever increasing sales graphs of the auto companies,I feel there will be fewer cars after twenty years than there are today. Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers. Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call. Retail giants like walmart and food kings like McDonalds are accessible over short distances. These things virtually eliminate the need to go out,drive and shop. With the advent of the internet, it is very much possible to work from home. With means like video conferencing the members of a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe. E-learning has opened new horizons. Classes and even archives are available online.

809338.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,Today it is very difficult to invent new things or find new ways to be successful. But what is the best way to be successful? Should you take risks? And for which people is it easier to take risks? In my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk. Because there must be no reasons because this person is unsuccessful. So perhaps an unsuccessful person has already taken some risks which were not successful. So they are kind of afraid of taking new risks. If the new idea is wrong they will lose again. And this is different for successful people. They have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risks. They are not afraid. If the risk was wrong there is a basis under them and nearly nothing could happen to them. But one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risks. For this I will give an example. You have to imagine you are the CEO of a big company and at the moment the number one with your products in the world.

997336.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ideas and concepts came from the facts. I somewhat agree with this idea that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. In my life I usually work on both of them. I understand the ideas and concepts. However, I learn facts from many stories. To understand the ideas we have to think and understand the ideas that have many types. For example, it is easy for anyone of us to make ideas about anything, but on the other hand it is difficult for him to make facts. The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact? Many students and professors have a great talent for making an idea. I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I spent two hours with my professor at the university to discuss the idea that my professor gave our class. Two hours spent understanding what his idea focuses on? And what are the goals of the idea? The idea was about business solutions to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city. It provides many aspects and aims.","According to the example, I like to understand that I am interested in knowing more about, but sometimes I don't care about some ideas that don't make sense.",0

One of the problems is using your own car, using public transport. I agree with the statement because i think that in a few years there willn't be as many cars as now because other comfortable and faster ways of transport will be used, as for example the plane. its at this moment one of the best ways of transport or another possibility is using cars that work with solar energy or with water containing with the environment.

1598284.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts? By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information. Huge topics and their contents can be covered in a minimum of time. But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned it. If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they really know it and will not forget it as quickly as they would if they just learnt it without understanding. So both sides have their positive and negative arguments. The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand. Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not really understand or would you be better off with some information you can handle and understand? Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just too huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it. So one should not concentrate on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) and one should not just learn facts. You would not know what to do with them. It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs that you have not learned, you are helpless. Referring to the question of the essay, there is no ""more important"". It is as important to learn facts as to understand ideas and concepts. If students go to an extreme they will find out that this does not work.","Today society is complex, human nature and a lot of processes are complex too.",0

1206804.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The department I am currently studying has a policy to encourage all the students to specialize in finance or marketing. The logic behind it is that you can not make smart choices if you have less and broad knowledge in a specific topic. I totally agree with the idea that focusing is better. Because I believe that you can not talk or make comments about every topic in the world and specializing encourages you to learn more and makes you love the topic more. Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details. Therefore the ability to make a comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible. For instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film can only tell one or two sentences. However a person who watched the film and read many things from the magazines about the film can make comments or discuss the film. Thus, people having less about a topic have not the right to discuss this issue and can not be able to make smart comments. Secondly knowing a lot of things about an issue encourages learning the topic more and makes love the topic. Because beauty hides in the details. When I start to learn about a topic it always seems to me very boring and hard to understand.

What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean,so it is impossible to pursue in many acedamics. The better way is to take a single subject. We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field. He gets the skills of innovation , works hard ,and tries to concentrate on his subject. since he is free to choose the subject of interest he will pursue with zeal and eagerness. He will be more clear about his future plans. There was a saying that"" jack of all,master of none"". this surely happens if someone enters into too many academic institutions. the main reason people forget one if they learn another. if a person enters many fields there is a chance of confusion and they end up in a mess. researchers also conveyed that people concentrating on different subjects can not gain anything. the more you go the less you will learn. according tomy opinion it is better to master a single subject than to make all the stuff included in the brain.",by this he understands his aim and works to achievegoals.,0

However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping.

Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people. Thus, they do simpler trips while young people travel to diverse places.

However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons.

Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts. It is hard to catch the main ideas, students may only be interested in the stories, but didn't know the meaning. It can't happen when you focus on the ideas or the concepts. Because the concepts and ideas are the standard for whole stories. In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content of this course.

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it.

According to this phrase, I think that people who try to do new things normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who simply does his/her usual job. What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to society. A lot of men can do things well, but only men who do things better than others can reach a higher level in social life. Taking risks is part of being a successful person. Someone who does not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by society.

It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts. It is a more difficult thing than learning facts. First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts isn't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think most of the kids don't know which of these. Do you know why? Most parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong.

What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car.

Ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt. Because it is only an idea. But the fact is different. Facts must be done in real life. I think it is more important to learn facts than ideas. Because facts are real but ideas are not. You can learn so many ideas about something but you can't apply these ideas in real life. It is not important if you don't apply ideas in real life. But if you know facts you can apply them immediately when you hear ideas. But if you know only ideas you cant do anything in real life. For example an electronic engineer can know how television works. But he/she knows only the idea of how it works. I think this is not important. In real life people dont pay attention toideas. People pay attention to facts. Because facts are real and applicable. People want to see something. People dont want to hear only ideas. If they see facts then people pay attention toideas.

1818765.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible. It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius. To sum up, the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things.

In the present era most young people have become self centred and they are not in a mood to know about the problems of the world. they are always seeking their own comforts. for example consider that if robbers have entered the neighbour's house of a man and he comes to know that, first he is taking care of the valuables in his house rather than helping his neighbour. nowadays, young people are lacking in moral and ethical values. they have become worse than the birds. i. e. if a crow dies or is wounded then a large number of crows gather at that place and shout,but when it comes to people if a person is met with an accident on a road most of them pass as if they dont see that incident. They did not even call an ambulance. instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness. According to me this system has to change,each human should help others. One person has to help atleast three people in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person has to ask those three individually to help three others. now nine people have been benefited and these nine have to help three others each individually.

Companies and goods sellers should talk and describe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising them in a proper and honest way are mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials of high quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are.

In fact, they can make products look much better than they really are. Therefore, they can make them look different sizes and more beautiful. First, tricking customers' eyes is a really good way to get more money. First, you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it look the desired to people. For example, I remember a TV show that was unbelievable to win a sports car if anyone answered the question shown on the screen. However, the question was so easy that I was going to call them. I saw alot of people calling them; in fact, the TV show got alot of money from the people calling it. A person won the sports car, finally, and he was so happy. However, the funny thing is that the car was a really small car. Actually, it was a kid's car toy. Therefore, they showed the car, and everyone thought that it was a real car with a real engine, but that tricked everybody even me. I think that this is a smart way of marketing products.

Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result. As in our immune system, our body will respond to the invading pathogens more powerfully in subsequent exposures than the first one.

Before applying students should take the following aspects into consideration. Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you have received the job you can still and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for. Secondly, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extent there is some truth in it, but, undoubtedly, experience shows that no matter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same.

Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence.

Free thinking can be helpful in our society. these thinking can produce a more advanced future. just to learn the facts and memorize them block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can. for example , i read the book a few days ago after reading the book i agreed with it. the book includes information about French education. the children learn mathematics in school they have to solve the problem but they can't count the number well. when they learned mathematics they were focussed on remembering the formula and they always studied the same questions. sometimes they faced higher problems but they also depended on the formula. so, oneday their homeroom teacher asked them ""which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2? ""children answered ""1/4"" they knew only a bigger number. they couldn't think about the amount and range and degree. so i suggest that they should be learnd with new ways like experiments and express their thinking,even if it's wrong. another one is about art. art includes alot of things. such as drawing and taking a picture and acting and so on. i want to say about the acting actors or actresses who don't know how to act and speak before getting the paper with their role. they have to act depending on themselves.",and have to imagine and understand the situation.,0

On the other hand decrease in developed countries. Among those countless factors that affect my opinion, I would only explore a few primary ones as follows. The essential reason why cars in developing countries will become more and more in 20 years is that developing countries are more likely to develop their industry as their first goal in the following years. As a result, the car, an important criteria to show the level of the development of a developing country, will be more and more under the leadership of the government.

As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest.

First of all, most advertisements try to emphasize the good point more than the weak point. Eventhough it is not good for the body and it istroublesome, they just want to sell the product. For instance, as you know, fast food is not good for your health. However, the companies which produce fast food, they usually hide the fact which can cause problems for the body like cancer. In particular, for children, they can be addicted to fast food because they just see the advertisement which looks delicious.

It contains no arguments to support its claim. Young people do give enough time to helping their communities nowadays, as they always have. I do not see the reason for elderly people to believe in this statement, or to view our youth in a critical manner. Yes, the youth might be somewhat different than the generation of people they grew up in, but it does not need to be different in a negative way. Their criticism merely demonstrates their inability to take responsibility or to adapt to recent events, which would bring about a difference in mentality in the next generation. Most probably people making such a statement are not satisfied with their own contribution to their communities and will try to ease their minds by making such a claim. Often pensioners who have nothing better to do, i. e. make no contribution to their communities, make such a claim. This statement is in no way a constructive statement, as it gives no suggestion of changing the circumstances. Therefore the person putting forth this statement is not helping his community in doing so. This statement is so broad, that it is hard for me to think of any specific examples out of my head, but in general, young people are the people who drive a community and contribute to its culture through their motivation.",This claim is nonsense.,0

115632.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"The given statement is ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"". I disagree with the above statement because, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems to be alright when in childhood, but this seems to be complex and cumbersome as we grow older and older. Firstly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly. For example, consider a high school student. If he needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school, apart from his personal interest which he shows in a particular subject, the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome. Secondly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, the frequency at which we do get updates about these subjects greatly matters. We need to have a greater frequency of updation in all areas, which is not a simpler task.","For example, consider a student studying Computer Sciences.",0
263612.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right. Take math for example, during my high school days, I had to answer lots of questions. A math teacher explained the concepts first, and then made us answer questions. If I could understand the concepts, it was not difficult to answer the questions. So when I studied other subjects such as chemistry and physics etc. I applied the same method, that is, understanding the concepst, first. Here is another example. In terms of parenting, especially money related, I think good parents are not the people who can give big money to their children but teach them how to make money. You might think this is a different story, but it is related to the topic, I think. All parents want their children to be successful and rich. But there are types of parents. One just tells their children how they made money, and instructs them to do something to make money without explaining what the concepts behind the facts are. Another type wants to explain what is important and more important. They know that facts will change, yet if you can understand the concepts behind the facts, you can improvise to any circumstances. Many young people inherit big money from their parents, yet for those reasons I mentioned above, lots of people don't maintain their wealth.","Things are always changing, and I think along with the changing surroundings the facts can be changed.",0
721448.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the opinion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts for them. I will explain the three reasons. First, I think understanding concepts is basic. You can't build a tall building without rock as a basis even though you may build a short block like a house on the sands. If you learn the facts without an accurate concept, you may hear you are smart at first. But eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of facts will collapse. Second, I think you should experience the proper process. Everything has an order in process. Understanding concepts is a start. So you can't understand further facts without them. If you skip something , you will meet trouble in the end. Speaking again, If you ignore the process of understanding accurately, you will find you didn't even know an easy thing. Third, you should understand the academic thing as a whole. All the stories and facts link together. You should understand something through another thing. If you learn facts separately, it seems like you see the tree but can't see the forest. So I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts.",A pile of There is no meaning without basic understanding.,0

572315.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It's a very interesting topic to write on. Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price. He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price. Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets success and another takes a regular film which is a flop,who again takes the risk of talking about another variety film, definitely the successful one. So I agree that successful people take risks rather than only doing what they already know.",I hope most people agree with the topic because every one knows the value of success in life.,0
1097149.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to take risks to achieve good life standards therefore taking risks is a very important aspect of human life. Some think that doing what they already know how to do well is better, contrary to those who think that trying new things and taking risks is more important to be successful. In my opinion, I personally agree with the second idea. These are the following reeasons. First of all, taking risks is important to struggle with the difficult life conditions. For example, some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging, cycling. Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them. However , if people want to enjoy life more and be more healthy , they should try new and risky sports. They shouldn't be afraid of them doing risky sports. In addition to this, taking risks is a fundamental issue because of the experience of life more deeply. For instance, i always do the most difficult tests first at school. Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it.","Although it means taking risks, i prefer to do it and anytime i am not in a bad situation.",0

How creative and smart he is! But have you tried to be knowledgable like him? It is definitely not a sophisticated task if you know the benefits from being knowledgable. Indeed, if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you will be more successful in your personal life and in your practical career. First of all, just imagine yourself knowing a huge variety of knowledge. That in fact will make your personal life easier. it will also help you to face many problems in your daily life. As we all know, you may face many challenges in your life and without being broad knowledgeable you can not control all matters. In retrospect, I still remember my uncle who was very knowledgable. I was a big fan of his. I used to ask him. ""my uncle, what makes you successful in your life. ""He answered, "" learn and learn until that last moment of your life. That will make your future brighter. ""And I used his advice and from that time and started reading and reading. Now, I can see the huge difference in my mind and in my life. Secondly, Being broad knowledgeable will make your career more successful. We sometimes in our careers need some ideas in other fields. For instance, I work at the Capital Bank of Saudi Arabia. My major is economics but sometimes I need some information on the computer. Because of that, I decided to attend computer classes.

1450186.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I disagree with the statement that successful people do not try new things and they use their previous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task. One of the examples I can remember of this is that a girl who always sat with me in my lunch period. She always worked very hard and I could see that she was a successful person and also will be in the future from what I saw of her. One day when she was doing her homework in front of me, I could not even tell what she was studying since it seemed like a difficult thing to me, she asked me if I could understand the question asked in the homework. I told her it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she can't even figure out.

I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone.","Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too.",0
136505.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ignorance is far more important than knowing the facts. understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher. humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the facts from the early stone age we understand concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubbing two stones together thus understanding the process of combustionby using stones. we cant simply rely on the subject by knowing but for understanding it. for example every one knows about the law of conservation of energy,a person who understands applied in the form of electricity or mechanical engine. A student who got good marks in an examination ca not become a good engineer or doctor or infact, be good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good. Thus, application is important for a student who comes with an understanding of the subject. A practical understanding of the subject is preferred rather than simply knowing it ,this is the reason why nowadays education orl study is based on formal work rather than simply class room teaching. each and every course of today whether you take a science or art or technology project and the field work isintroduced. The concept of understanding does not give us success in profession but also helps us get better in our subjects which we do not want to get for our lifetime. this doesnt happen simply by knowing.",a student should not apply this to the study but also to the various aspects ofdaily life.,0

That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being makes it easy to succeed in their common life. First, usually successful people attract more successful people. For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends. That is, this meeting provides them with the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and these kinds of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove themselves and normally, they are going to win, the people tell us that they are lucky people. It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance.

865467.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this statement. I would like to talk about my opinion with 3 reasons. First, It is a problem for us, humans. We already know the earth has a lot of environmental problems. I think CO2 is the most famous cause of destroying the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how convenient a car is. If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can't do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries. I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some people worry about how we charge for electricity. If researchers make more services or think more useful ideas, those will be used by more people. Then, how about the developing countries. The last reason is the problem of developing countries. In some places in the developing country, there is no airport or a train. The people who live in like this area use only a track or a car.

People have also used a lot of gas along with cars since they started to drive cars. But it led to oil that creates gas to be used up from the underground of the earth faster. If people didn't touch it, it wouldn't happen. But the spending or waste of gas is still going on now. So, waste of oils is caused by using up of them.

They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers.

1840823.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts where it could bring out the natural talents in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room. Understanding the ideas and concepts makes the childern think more scientifically and discover more new things about a particular concept it inculcates a habit in children to analyse things in a more broad way and arrive at the results on their own. Understanding things rather than learning things from facts from the class room helps the child to remember the things for longer and in inculcate new ideas in arriving at new ideas which help them in a long way to go. Also, learning concepts and ideas rather than learning facts which were written or told by some one helps to develop a desire for inviduality in the child and to evaluate the issues in a rather broad way standing different from others. For example one of my friends with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed an idea which he implemented in one of his projects and his project was selected to be demonstrated at NASA in the United states. and he was also rewarded by the president of my country as the best out standing research student in his age group. Learning concepts and ideas would also children in their education where he could he could he could be interested in fields like research and things that really do matter a lot and even have lots of influence on his/her professional career. concepts and ideas and are not only confined to four walls of a room where these could be obtained from many places in nature in books in people and even in him self.",Finally i would conclude knowledge of ideas and concepts is a large ocean where there is no age barrier one doesn't have to understand the concept and implement his ideas inpractice.,0

You can choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risks to be successful. I definitely believe that people should try new things and take risks to be successful. If you do everything with a routine that means you know the results.

In my case, I'm 25 years old and I enjoy my life very much. I go out in the night, taking long journeys in the holidays and other time- and breathtaking hobbies, which give me a kind of resting and relaxing besides my work. For doing so, you need the time and a special sense of personal feeling.","Taking all of these examples in contradiction to my parents or my grandparents, who are much older than me, for sure, I'm able to go out very often during the week, visiting some bars and a disco afterwards and not suffer on the next day although if I spent the night in the city till dawn.",0
1134094.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparison to the risk resident people face. However, every human being has to know for himself or herself which goals and objectives he or she wants to achieve and how fast to get there.",In addition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success.,0

In tobacco advertisements, they always express bad images of tobacco. Outside the package of tobacco, they write about concern about cancer with tobacco. In the advertisements for tobacco, we can see bad images of tobacco, but many smokers don't stop smoking in spite of these advertisements. My friends watch these advertisements for tobacco everyday, but keep smoking. The advertisements for medicine have a restriction, so a medicine company can't use an expression which tells more effects than it really are. But about other products besides tobacco and medicine, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the TV commercials, beautiful women and handsome men use these products in sophisticated places happily. And also we can listen to fun commercial music which makes the images of these products better. Sometimes famous movie stars appear in the commercials and tell us how these products are great and useful.

As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are.

1315961.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do not agree with this statement because younger and older people have different ways to enjoy life. Life is not about age whether it is a young person or an older person, but instead about the symbolism of joy is a way of enlightening and bringing happiness. Younger people might think or have the idea that they are the only ones to enjoy life, but at what cost. Older people have the treasure of wisdom among knowledge, with a conviction of lots of experience, they have the mature and most important quality, patience. I have seen older people enjoying life more then younger people, but also, comes to a cost of good health. I have seen many older people that enjoy life as if they have the hearth of a twenty year old person. To me, life enjoyment is a long term learning experience that brings individuals to understand the meaning of enjoyment of life. When one is young, one can think that they have the energy to impose them selves on the world that they are indestructible and this might bring to a short end of life. A few years ago, I was talking to an old friend, he told me one important thing that marked my life for good: ""the diable is not smart because it is the diable, it is because the diable is old""; it is like the young or old wine, or like the age of the wiesky, what is it better an 8-year - old wiesky or a 24-year - old aged in a barril, I would go for the 24-year - old aged in a barril. For many things, as children one learns patience by trying to create something maybe a small plaster figure or a carvingon wood, but as one learns , it takes time to develop and to evolve.","this is why it does take time to go through school first in kindergarten, then into elementary following to middle school, and high school and later college where education teaches us that for anything to mature, it does taketime.",0
492113.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, the education systems are generally based on teaching ideas and concepts. The ideas of famous people and some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime. I think this system will not work in the near future. Because of technological advances, students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world. Thus, they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts.",They will deal with the issues which they really exist.,0

519398.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects,while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject. As for me, I would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only. Though there are a variety of subjects at a university for you to follow with. But a single man's energy and time are so limited that you can't afford wasting too much time on subjects that have nothing to do with your future career. Imagine a freshman majoring in Physics with a Selection Of English Literature in hand all day around, will he succeed in his field someday? Hardly. Furthermore, we call these ""academic subjects"" because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school. They are far more complex and complicated. You can't expect to manage it within a semester or two. It needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level in a certain field.","Some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because of an affection on the spur of the moment, as soon as he realizes that he won't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever, he will just simply drop halfway.",0
256269.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In a world that changes in a rapid way, you sometimes have to take risks to be successful, so I definitely agree with this statement. It has already started in the stone age. There, you even had to risk something to survive in an everchanging world. New opportunities belong to one human, who has tried them out before. What if everyone of us would maintain doing just what they know how to do well? That means, we wouldn't ever have any famous discoveries like cars, useful aids or the internet for instance. Starting a new business for example is such a risk. You might think you will regret it when you fail this experiment. But if you don't even try it, you can't find out, whether you will be successful or not. Furthermore, taking risks means learning new things and getting more knowledge, which is important for finding a good job or remaining in it. Because a more interesting employee is an employee who works hard and is able to switch into many sections.","Unless you can sometimes lose, when risking too much, it is a chance to create something new, never being indicated before.",0

However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home.

364007.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than old people. This agreement is based entirely on my own experience and common sense. To demonstrate what I believe, I would like to state some views here. Every time I meet young people, I feel an air of freedom. They may be presumptuous or fatuous, or even ill-mannered, but they are never anxious social climbers. They may have little knowledge or even be non-educated, but they have desires to explore the new world. Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there. All these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads young people to be higher, stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people. Another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth. Because of the limitations of age, the old lose lots of enjoyable things. They may be rich and healthy, but they do not have interests in nice food; they can buy a great variety of clothes, but they do not have good looks.","Apart from their elders, the young take advantage of a nice age.",0
1578728.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Do you have more pleasure when you were a kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious. We will see that being young provides less responsibility, more time and places to socialize and better health to enjoy life. The biggest difference between older and younger people is that the young ones have fewer sorrows. Children and teenagers don't have to worry about money, their parents do. They also don't need to worry about cleaning the house, buying food, it is also their parents' job. The lack of responsibility enables us to focus on other things in life: having fun. School is not only a place to study, it is also the best place to make friends. Courses and breaks are special opportunities to discover new people and socialize with them. During all the studies, a student will meet more people than he can ever in his grown up, office life. Old people also have other concerns. As we say in France: ""If young people knew if old people could.",""".",0
865467.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with this statement. I would like to talk about my opinion with 3 reasons. First, It is a problem for us, humans. We already know the earth has a lot of environmental problems. I think CO2 is the most famous cause of destroying the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how convenient a car is. If the famous people or government said ""Stop using a car! ! "", we can't do it. The second, it problem is in the developed countries. I said about the car which made CO 2, but now they are researching some eco - cars in some companies, for example hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometimes we can see this car in my city, but it is more expensive than normal cars. On the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some people worry about how we charge for electricity. If researchers make more services or think more useful ideas, those will be used by more people. Then, how about the developing countries. The last reason is the problem of developing countries. In some places in the developing country, there is no airport or a train. The people who live in like this area use only a track or a car. If they can not use those, they can't transport some foods or things. I think some areas must develop to improve our own country's situation, so transportation is very important to develop. And this problem is not only this. The developed countries send a lot of used cars which is of course expensive, making CO 2 for the developing countries too cheap.",Those will be more increasing.,0

There will be an impact and effects on the environment by such an increase in car production. the population will increase the number  of animals and plants will be affected. in addition to that there will be a problem with movement from place to other because of crowded cars. imagine that no body can arrive at work on time, no students can attend their classes on time, no one can miss his flight.

466340.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Every one knows that when we are learning we learn facts and ideas. No one in the world can change the facts because facts are facts. Some people just like to know the facts and they do not pay attention to other ideas. In my case, I strongly believe that understanding ideas is more important for students than understanding facts. I think like this because of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respond to others, it makes you creative and makes you persuasive. First, understanding ideas opens up very good and big ways of thinking. It makes you think and respect other people's opinions. If we look at facts, we will find that most of thefacts were just ideas in the past and by discussing them they become facts. Second, trying to understand ideas is a good way to make your brain work. It makes you create new ideas and new opinions. On the other hand, understanding facts is like opening your mind, putting things in it and closing it. Third, understanding ideas led you to the facts. I believe that most of the facts are conclusions to ideas. If you understand the idea you can easily figure out the fact. I think understanding ideas teaches us how to be a persuasive person because when you are trying to get a result from an idea, you are following certain and clear steps. This certain way of thinking can appear in your personality. Finally, I believe that understanding ideas is very important but also we can not say understanding facts is not important. We should know the main and important facts of every thing.","On the other hand, we do not make understanding facts our way of learning and thinking.",0

Advertising may make anything better by a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be the fascination towards the product. and looks matter alot. for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you.",isn't it? that is where advertising comes into the picture.,0
1419617.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In my opinion i would agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are many reasons and ways in which people can make low quality products look brilliant. The main highlight which people see is the packaging of the product which can be excellent and also interesting also through tv and newspaper advertisements people give in easily without knowing the quality of the product just because they have seen or heard from their friends and neighbours. A product which can be good for others need not necessarily be good for you because nowadays on the market there are more fake products than there are original ones. The choice is yours whether you would be comfortable with the product and whether it satisfies your needs it would be safe to buy from a store where there are more customers which shows the market value. I would also disagree with the following reasons. first, a new product which comes onto the market may look bad but can also turn out to be excellent Eg-A new shampoo which your friend has used has caused her hair to have split ends this may not necessarily happen to you you may have a better reaction to this product like even for perfumes you either like the smell or you dont. Mainly advertisements are the best technique to sell a product and a good way to get recognized in the market. other methods also include selling the product through door to door selling. People in the world believe many advertisements which come in magazines or newspapers -For a fitness program medicines there are many frauds in the market selling fake medicines instead of the original and these cause people to destroy their lives due to the expenses and uncertainity of the item. i have discussed both opinions about why advertisements can be dangerous and brutal to your pocket if you do not pay attention to which shop the product is sold in and what the market demand is.",But i would say that there are more frauds out there than salesmen.,0

A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement.","For example,.",0

The current techniques are getting more complicated and the competition is getting more intense as time goes on. Therefore, it is more likely to be recommended to devote a specific field of study or work and to be highly qualified in it. First, the current field of research, such as computer science and electronic technology, which dominate the development of a current society, need very deft and highly qualified skills and knowledge. These fields of products change actually every minute. The cellphone which was produced early this year is already outmoded and a 2-year-old laptop is not producing anymore.","Moreover, it is getting common to access the Internet with phones and laptops everywhere, and I can do whatever I want, like watching TV, movies, or chatting on line with my friends.",0

I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer. The life experience and career of a person can support one answer and undermine the other answer. A speciality is a relative concept in this case.

197162.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Yes, i agree with the statement. Young people are the future of the world,they remain active in their young period but while they get older they losepatience,concentration and the body organs get weak,they may see inactive compared with young people. As young people have many dreams and have many goals to achieve. They work accordingly to achieve their goals and their age is in the stage that they are ready to do anything,young people say and prove 'nothing is impossible'. they can jump,play and enjoy the wholelife to the maximum extent. well about older people they will losetheir patience ,they have to look after the whole family and will face many problems regarding family and now they have no strength to do more work,no strength to dance ,jump and travel. For example ,lets take my young cousin,when his family went on holiday including his grandfather who is 70 years old,my cousin explored the whole city and visited many religious places,which made him happy or he may enjoythat. while his grandfather who is also interested in seeing those places, was due to his physical weakness and due to the temperature variance he didn't resist at that place. And many places are in hilly areas which are to be travelled by walk,as his grandfather had no strength and he didn't enjoy the trip. Young people have many ways to enjoy their life at maximum. Nowadays, young girls are the main factor in their enjoyment,they go out with their girl friends in which they find much enjoyment. But older people can't do that as they are married they are restricted in theirlimitations. This is a silly example but it is a huge reality statement.

People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads. Besides telecommuting and air pollution, cars are expensive because of technology. When we look at the past, cars are more developed than in the past. Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future.

Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. However, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone rather than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conspicuous aspects as follows. The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guides lead you to and have no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get access to the local people' s life and culture. Through talking and living with them, you can have different cultures and perspectives on life. That will only present you with a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world. there is another reason deserving some words here. Travelling in a group led by a tutor is a waste of money in some conditions. Because the guide depends on the money you spend on the trip to survive.

There are many people who are successful who take a lot of risks. So successful people try new things and take risks: although some people think that they are only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, risks and new things expand the vision of people, because every new thing and risk brings new experiences. Through these experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions. So their vision is changed according to their experiences. For example; my father is an engineer. When he graduated he went to Germany for his internship. He worked as a worker in a building. During his internship, he experienced and learnt how he could build a strong building. Now he has his own company which is related to building structures. Opponents argue that, successful people only do what they already know how to do well. Good productions bring success.

Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example. I saw the information through a diagram of smart people,When some journalist asked a question about how they studied? Most people who made good score people said ""I used to spend a lot of time thinking hard. In my conculsion, Through our life, time becomes the most important thing in our social life. But currently students have a hard choice between learning more specific information or just knowing the surface information.",But time and grade are not at all of our life.,0
1299460.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like.","Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound.",0
1058201.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Building knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied. The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is collected around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority will have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak.","Also if knowledge was limited to only one subject, scientistsn't wouldn't have success the success which they have today.",0

One of the most important oil uses is transportation, including people's transportation.

Although cars are getting more and more efficient in the oil spending, the truth is that during the next twenty years the costs of oil will increase a lot, so cars will be fewer. On the contrary, the development of alternative energy supplies, like hydrogen, or the use of clean technologies like solar energy, could stop the decrease in the number of cars used.","Besides, these days, a lot is accepted by the citizens and the sensitivity to the environmental problems that oil burning causes is higher and higher.",0
1267483.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"""You should go to school, learn a lot of different things. "" That is what parents often said. But I do not completely agree with the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In deed,I support the view that specialization is a good thing. So, people know what they are talking about. In some fields, like men who built houses, specialization is necessary : how could someone as good at painting as a wood table? Furthermore, it implies a longer study if you want to have broad knowledge. Moreover, if someone has broad knowledge, I think it is impossible that he knows accurately all his many academic subjects he has even learned. This is a great problem, there are not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity. You need to be very smart, like Leonard from Vinci. He is a good example. Nevertheless, in contrast to my first explanation, it is important too, to have people who know a little bit about everything. Important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referants between specialists. And because of their knowledge, they will be able to resolve problems and manage a team. That's why they have a great adaptability. To conclude with this statement, i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists. They both complain about themselves.","But like specialized doctors in aesthetic for example, couldn't ze imagine more people who could have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and after that more specialized in one subject ?.",0
1956445.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with this statement because everyone now only cares about himself and does not think of others , others represent their communities. Everyone has a community to live in ,but do not give it enough time to help. What is your community like? Your community is representing you. If you do not give your community a time to help you, you do not even help yourself. You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community, your community will develop so you will develop and you will think better to have a very good and connected community. Why do young people not give their community enough time to help. I think that they do not think of this or this thing or even do not come to their mind. For example my cousin works very hard to get a very high salary and to have a very comfortable life and to get his family happy with what he has done but he did not think that he could get his community time to help.",maybe if he thinks they will help and this is why young people do not give their communities time they want someone to tell them because they only think of what they have and what they will have and ignore their communities.,0

Parking it is becoming a real challenge,and the frustration that builds everyday is taking up very big proportions. The statistics showed that in twenty years the population of the world will be at about six billion. Right now we are only four billion.

492113.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, the education systems are generally based on teaching ideas and concepts. The ideas of famous people and some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime. I think this system will not work in the near future. Because of technological advances, students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world. Thus, they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts. They will deal with the issues which they really exist. They will give more importance to the occurrences. I think it would be better when the students learn the facts, after that they can find the fundamental idea behind this fact and the students can both learn two issues by analyzing the facts. If this system is formed, the students begin to learn the issues by experiencing the living facts. The drawbavk of teaching the ideas and concepts is creating an abstract education for the students. The student may never encounter these ideas or concepts in their lifetime. However the facts are real and nobody can ignore and run away from these facts. All the students will be adults in near future and will face these facts. If they meet the facts in their school years, this experience enables them to cope with woes easily. Another essential benefit of teaching facts is improving the attention of the students. The examples of the real world will arouse their attention and I think they will want to participate in the debates about the occurrences. This system increases the efficiency of education, the other system is so boring in respect of this one.",Because the students only memorize the ideas and concepts.,0

In my opinion, we can use the internet to do many things, It is more convenient to travel around, and in the city, you can use buses or subway to go to anyplace you want. First of all, we can use the internet to do many things. For instance, people in the feature will work at home and use the internet to do their job. Students don't go to school anymore, because they use the internet to complete the group discussion, or find something about the assignment from a teacher who teaches them through the internet. In addition, it is more convenient to travel around by train or airplane. The train or airplane will be improved. For example, the price of the train and airplane will be very low, Does anyone want to drive by himself or herself or herself? taking the train or airplane is more efficient than driving your own car. Finally, in the city, you can use a bus or subway to go to anyplace you want. If you own a car, you will pay huge taxes on the car, and drive it out a few times.

It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people.

In my community, every teenager has to study for their own good. Because they spend the day studying, they don't have enough time to help the community. I am a teenage girl and I want to volunteer to support the town, but I do not have the time. I believe that young people would like to help the community. In their middle schools or high schools, if they have free time they would hang out with their friends. Because they did the hard work studying, they want to rest. Teenagers would like to rest in their home playing computer games or watching TV.","In my school, students have to work for the community for a certain amount of time, but they would ask their dad to make a certificate which proves that the student volunteered for the work.",0
1717762.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","In the world, there are so many cars that people can use them for transportation. It is necessary because of illness. When one of the family members becomes ill, she needs a car. That's why an ambulance may not come immediately. However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home. They also don't go out for this reason. Moreover, telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jams. As long as people work these jobs. There aren't any traffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason. In addition to telecommuting, air pollution is a really big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollution for many reasons. Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells. People can affect them in a negative  way. Furthermore, people want to live healthily without automobile gases. I think that the government use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads. Besides telecommuting and air pollution, cars are expensive because of technology. When we look at the past, cars are more developed than in the past. Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future.","Moreover, For instance, I work in a job, but my earnings are not enough to buy a car.",0
1481375.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Nowadays, there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects. Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects, I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it. First, when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic, he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth. These issues are often complex, and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable. As a result, it is possible to take a position on debated issues. For instance, I have studied psychology for many years and in my country, different types of psychology are debated now. Having this deep knowledge in this particular field, I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion. Also I can stand in a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue. In addition, I think that if I know a subject very well, it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects. As everything is related, it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways.

And today world has nothing to do with the `facts` indeed. in many countries education systems are so restrictive and so close to development and research that students find themselves in an environment which is totally close to the facts. when using textbooks is the only option the students have and when they are expected to be successful in a kind of competition at the end of which the winner takes it all how can we expect the students to possibly try to reach for the facts? the system forges the students to be tend to get the ideas and concepts.",In addition to that we live in a world which has nothing to do with the facts.,0

Among the divers reasons I support this opinion, there are two reasons. First, through understanding ideas, students may become more logical than before. For example, when I was a high school student, I would attend the experiment in science class in the laboratory. it makes me solve the teacher's prompt which makes me get a complicated theory inscience. In addition , the course in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomena such as global warming , soil erosion, and so on which make me a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, I agree that students must focus on understanding rather than learning facts since they would be logical. secondly, as students under standing ideas, they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which make all around the world thrive more than before.","For example, when I was a middle school student, I would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness.",0

The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into a --- normal person. From not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life.","To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology.",0

Because he may be helpful with these subjects in future instead of learning one subject. for the future he wants to know every section, so for practising he will learn as many subjects as possible. The other reason for this will be that some students should have more talent and hard work to learn more subjects in different areas like languages and know the different traditions and cultures, because such type of students will be very useful for learning more subjects. For learning one subject and knowing fully about such subject is useful in such subject in certain conditions, but the several conditions it will not be useful for people. so learning more is better than learning less, People who know many skills will have a good comparison to the others.","The main reason for learning more subjects than one specific subject will be a, the opportunities for society in the present conditions will be high for knowledge in several areas.",0
345389.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When students study, they need to understand what they study, rather than learning the facts of it. Because, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful to understand problems much deeply, much easier to memorise, and much more acceptable for other problems that they have faced. first, understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful for students to understand what they study better than facts. When students start to understand the idea and concept of certain questions, they will find what was the cause, and how it works. It's like grapes. All the teeth of guiers are matching perfectly the machine works. Therefore, to understand what they are studying deeply, then they need to understand what the idea of it is. Second, understanding of ideas and concepts will be in students' minds a longer time than learning facts. Because, there are lost of facts in all single questions. If students start to study facts, then they have to memorise all of the facts which is a bigger number than ideas and concepts. Lots of facts can be found in lots of similar type of questions However, those are similar questions, so if the students remember only one idea or concept, then they will be able to solve all of thequestions, instead of remembering all of the factors for each question. Therefore, understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts, so that will remain in students' brains for much longer. Third, ideas are much more appealing than facts when they have some other problems. When they understand the idea, they will follow on that idea and stick to lots of thinking and reach a much further idea and study more widely. However, the facts are too certain, narrow.","Also it cannot be changed, like a stone.",0

This is because young people have knowledge or skills to adopt now. Older people find it difficult to do that.

In fact, I am in the young generation right now. I, of course, enjoy my life. Going to school, exercising my body and exploring new worlds are all enjoyable for me and other young people. For doing them, pioneer spirits, healthy bodies and motivation for getting new things are required. However, it is a heavy task for olders. Among them, some people still have those powers, but most people tend to be less motivated. For example, my grandmother does not want to do anything except for her rutines which are to take care of the household or talking to only similar people ondays. One time, I asked her to travel with my family. But, she refused even if she was very healthy. She just did not want to leave her house and the normal environment she spent her time in.

I agree with this First of all, the most important reason is the heavy burden of their studies. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests.

Actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes. We are also interested in cars that are good for the environment. The car industry will change their way of selling the car to customers. Of course, I think of the customer for the environment of the earth will change in this few years. Second, I think that physical translation is not convenient in countryside. For me, I live in the country side, I can not ride on the bus or train when I want. It is different between the big cities like Tokyo and small cities. So people who live in the country side, they use their own car now. I also use my own car. The number of cars in countryside has increased more than before. But on the other hand, now gasoline is so expensive. If this situation continues, the number of cars may decrease. I imagined that reason. But, I think if the cost of gasoline is expensive, the bus company will change the timetable so as not to move out. That is why, people will have to use their own car. Japanese companies like Honda and Toyota are famous in many other countries. If they invent a new car that does not use gasoline so much or something, it will spread all over the world, and then many people will be able to think about the environment of the earth even if they use the car.",It is very good for us.,0

I am a communications expert and it is a shame to accept that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. It is true. But why do I agree with the statement? There is a simple reason: The most important thing in the advertisement world is to persuade people to buy anything, in a lot of cases, things that probably people never are going to use. There are two possible reasons that make people do this. One is money and the other aspect is people's ignorance. The money is the first reason that makes us do this. In a world when only the most powerful survive, money is the best way to get things. It means, that if you have money, you have power. And it is what the businessmen and the companies want: power.","Then, if they have successful with their products, they are going to have money and consequently power.",0

And it is right, in a certain way. In fact, our society shows admiration for these kinds of people. But we have to go deeply into this field to demonstrate another side of this way of life if we are living. First of all, let us consider in which way taking risks could be a good strategy. If you are used to taking risks by trying new things, you will become more and more famous. In that respect, our society is proud of these kinds of behaviour. For example, you didn't pass your exams when you were young. But you succeed in building your own business. Then, journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take. Thanks to these articles, you will become famous. Due to these sides, this strategy seems very attractive. But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank. According to me, it is a lack of consciousness, especially when you are in charge of a family. This argument is far from being useless. When you make the choice of taking risks to succeed in your life, you must be aware of this. To sum up, I can't help thinking that taking risks is a very good strategy.

But now,more and more Chinese people have started to buy cars instead of bikes. Of course so do the people in India. People need cars when they want to go to a place not so near to them. And I don't think the people in well-developed countries, like the USA and Japan,will stop using cars. People feel inconvenient when they lose something they are used to using. In the usa,the USA is so wide that people who live there can't leave theircars. The car companies are trying to make light cars which consume less gasoline to reduce pollution.

This must depend on how we see life and what we expect from it. For example some weeks ago, I was talking with my grandfather about his early years in college.

How did he/she get that thinking? once if they are having some grasp or idea on the topic. The student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity.

1172673.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""Young people are strong and dynamic"" These words are proved by great scholars and philosophers of our country. I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands. Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs. they feel experimenting with them is an enjoyment. But those r not really enjoyable things in fact which apoil the carrier of the youngster. those kinds of enjoyment are restricted and enjoyment should be done so that he has a good time and good memories which he can share with his young generation. Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more ability to enjoy themselves. Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment. But older people cannot have as much enjoyment as youngsters as they have no energy and capability to enjoy themselves. Older people will have to think about their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories. Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying themselves. Those youngsters' ages don't permit them to control themselves from having fun. even in school or at educational places we have special time for refreshing and enjoyment for youngsters. This is only because youngsters should have enjoyment equally with studies. It is a saying by our great schoolteachers saying""All work no play makes a man lazy"" youngster needs some fun apart from their routine education life. this is mainly to have peace of mind and relaxation Young people are more flexible when compared to old people they can do any adventure, whereas old people all depend on young people. Young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more time and interest in enjoyment and youngsters have to give importance to enjoying life to make themselves active on all basis. young people really have great energy and enthusiasm for enjoyment they can enjoy the whole day but they dont get tired this is only because of their interest. this interest is to be provoked in studies. Therefore i totally agree with the above statement saying ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do""because older people should have sweet and unforgettable memories in their age and this can only be done by older people only if they enjoy their life in the young age.",The starting and ending of life depends on the enjoyment basis which is only obtained at a young age.,0
380681.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,Before starting with my opinion of the topic i must say that in this life what is the most important thing about a product? So if we want to respond to this question we can say that the image of a product is very important but it's only a vision. So I agree with the topic.,"The advertisements make products seem like good images, so people are involved in buying these.",0
1558621.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable at making the advertisements, I totally agree that most of them aren't satisfying consumers' expectations. I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products. So it will even cause the situation worse than now.",From those kinds of accounts I expressed my opinion.,0

1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight.","If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home.",0
830290.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"For me it is important to say that most people start from the same level. I mean the same money and culture. So when somebody is young he has to decide what to do in his life, so he has to decide. The problem is that almost nobody knows what he will do in his future. That`s the reason because a lot of people do a lot of different jobs at the beginning hoping to find the right one.","The purpose of man is to find the best way to live, at least for himself.",0
1570522.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I think its true that most young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy their life more than some old people in an age of 70 bi 75. young people have all their power and don't have to think about their health anddeath. old people have not so much patience and some are really frightened about their death, so they live with thoughts all around their death and so they are not so happy as young people. But if someone is old but still has enough power to do sports and if he will be happy too. When a person has a religion and believes in a life after death, it would help him or her a lot not to think always about death. So I think that young and old people could both be unhappy or happy in their lives. when I think about it, I come to the conclusion that you can ` t say that old people don`t enjoy their lives as much as young people do, its different from person to person. young people have more power than old people have but old people have seen more in their lifetimes than young people, learned more and know more. young people have more problems with love, school and self - confidence and old people have more problems with death and solitude alone. Young people and old people enjoy their lives together. young people do more sport or go to the disco and dance, but old people can read and learn and have no work to do They say that they can`t enjoy that. i think you can`t say that young people enjoy their lives more than old people do.",I think if you enjoy your life or not is only on everyonehimself.,0
1599863.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place. Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there. They may lose their way, and be in trouble with the particular language and culture.","For example, American children who go to Singapore receive a heavy punishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place.",0
1923351.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my view, success depends on the area where he is working t. So, i believe ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is true in some cases and it is not better in some other cases. Firstly, taking a sports man in to consideration he should adopt some new methods to improve his skills in his game rather than trying for some other games. so here the sports man is suggested to carry his carrier on the same field without going to other fields and taking risks. On the other hand ,let us see how success comes from new things. For example,white brothers invented aeroplanes as they were new to the world they were praised by the world.",And later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplanes are not so much praised as the white brothers.,0
1011356.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more free time. They must go to school , do their homework and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themselves. They spend most of their time at work. They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experiences during their life. In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be young is beautiful. If you were a child, you could do what you like without problems. A child thinks nothing about serious events or facts. Old people are under stress or serious. Young people are always happy.","Young people can enjoy life more then older people because they ca not look at bad things or facts but only at good , beautiful and beautiful things and events.",0

1329241.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family. I would like to give an example of my father who is a manager in a company, When i was a toddler he taught me to take first firm few steps in the path of my life and gave me good quality education by enrolling me in a good public school where i could set fort my academicjourney, so he has the responsibility to give me a good career in the path of my life by giving much attention to me he rather by enjoying himself he gave me platform to secure me future to path of success. Also, if we look at the cut throat competition between the world there is not enough time for elderly people to enjoy life Although this same holds for younger people, they could be able to manage time for their enjoyment. It is also important for younger people to enjoy it because of the study burden because i believe that a healthy body can dwell in a healthy mind so for the future success they must be stress free.",Enjoyment for younger people i believe that it is a dose for their tired nerves and if taken this dose will soothe their tired nerves and rejuvenate them for the upcomming responsibilities.,0
1484958.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Now the world is changing so fast and technology, too. the material need has become very important for people, whatever food, entertainment and spiritual life. People want to get more things from life. People use a lot of ideas to create the things that they want. However, we know most adversisements make products seem much better than they really are. Many companies have made many DM and advertisements to attract their customers. For the company, they just want people to buy their products. The advertisements are just a way to present their thoughts. However, the real product is not really like the advertisement. The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thoughts to their customers. Maybe they did not talk about how to use the products any more. They want the climents to keep their eyes on them. That is business. On the other hand, now there are many companies that sell their stuff in the TV show. They provide the time to use their products. If the customer does like the products that they can return to the company. From this time, the company really hope their customers know and to use their products. They not only just want to sell their stuff and they hope to understand what the customers want and what they need. The advertisements are just a way to express what they company what to say to the customer. The advertisements can not be the real products.

1526310.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this. When people watch television, read newspapers or walk in the street, they see a lot of advertisements. Even though people don't concentrate on that, they already have influenced. The first problem is the company cheats the customers. When the company makes a commercial for selling a product, they usually try to show their products as the best and they tell them only good points. Because they made people believe that products didn't have any defects and customers but it. However, there are also many bad points. It is one of the cheating. The other one is overconsumption. The commercial stimulates people to want to get those products and actually they don't need them, but they buy them. Sometimes buying is caused by developing the economy, but typically it has to disappear. The third reason is cost. If they make an advertisement, they need money and when they make an advertisement that looks better, they have to pay more. It is going to be caused by the increase. The increase will cause poor people to suffer from money. The purpose of companies is to make money. Whereas they earn money, people's savings decrease.",The companies must make good products and after customers will be able to judge them.,0
1658336.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Many people will have different ways of responding to this question. but most would say yes it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts. Understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life, once students understand concepts and ideas facts will come to them and, students will know what they are talking about later on. First of all, understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will naturally come to them.","for example, in business, if the students boss tells them to go do this this and this the student will immediately understand the idea and once he has understood the idea he will naturally understand the concept in order to do something.",0
1166105.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"So different are personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions. As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better. Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions.",This example can tell you right.,0
1265932.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In this topic, some students prefer learning facts, others believe understanding ideas and concepts is better. Nevertheless, I believe understanding ideas is better than learning the facts. First of all, students will usually choose to learn facts when they start the course. Because the facts are easily understood and it is interesting. But there are some disadvantages to learning facts. It is hard to catch the main ideas, students may only be interested in the stories, but didn't know the meaning. It can't happen when you focus on the ideas or the concepts. Because the concepts and ideas are the standard for whole stories. In addition, students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content of this course. Although the facts can let them know how to use it in society, it still limited. However we can't refuse it and it can lead to students getting some experience. It is still not general for the students. Finally, the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course. The facts concluding different types of knowledge. They are all useful. But the knowledge which is discussed in the course may lead students to the wrong way.",They may try to take more focus on other courses.,0
1015996.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. Successful people always think about new things. Because that is their confident behaviour to achieve their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses.",He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job.,0
622011.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People have different ideas about whether success is to create new things or to do usual work. Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make you happy comparing yourself with creating new things. I strongly agree that success is to create new things and take risks for several reasons. First of all, it is a great thing to be popular and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who will succeed?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which help sick people. So this person must be famous and every body will not want to work with them. In addition, you can not be a real successful person if you take risks and adventures. A person has to love his work to create new things and to succeed indeed. By taking risks you learn new useful things that help you in your life. My brother was in a running race and he not only won but also created a new personal best. He was very happy to take risks and score a new number. Last but not least, trying new things helps you to get more experience and self-confidence. By doing these new things you will be prodded and everybody will love you.

On the one hand some people think that to be successful they have to try different things. On the other hand, by doing what you already know you may be more efficient and successful because you avoid risk. However, most people have an aversion to the risk, and taking all aspects into account, I strongly feel that it is better to keep doing what you have been used to doing. To start with, it is true that if people do what they already know, they will be specialised in a task and therefore have a real social status. This status is one of the aspects of success.","In our modern society, it is important to have a social position in order to be different from other people.",0

Now , I will tell you my opinion, I agree that success is to try new things and take risks.

608718.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they haven't had too many sad experiences yet. I think that it is ironic since most people want to live longer. But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger. First of all I think that old disabled people who live on a large amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life. But older people like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people. It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously. Teenagers often consider the high school period as the worst period of their entire life. In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes. They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors. This is the expression of an unease. On the contrary to teenagers, adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoying life. Children don't want to become adults because they are reluctant to have too many responsibilities. They are not aware of the violence and of the other problems that one could encounter, if they are to be protected by their parents. Parents think that their children are happier thanks to their protection but on the contrary, children will be more disappointed when they discover how harsh life can be.

Even the way they succeed is different the common thing is that they gave their entire life to buildingit. In my opinion successful people don't try new things but try to develop the things they can do well. BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old. At that time there were two famous companies called MACANTOSHI & APPLE(well later they united though). He tried to learn computers because it was very interesting. later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself.

182182.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement. I have three reasons why I'm support the statement. First, it is natural to make products seem much better than they really are. The advertisement is about the economy. So, making products seem much better is natural. Please imagine. For example, food. If the advertisement for food doesn't look delicious, Most people will not buy it because it seems to taste bad. Then, the economy doesn't work. Nobody buys it, then, the products disappear. The reason why most people buy the product is influenced by the advertisement. At least, in Japan, most people are influenced by advertising. In fact, I'm one of them. Second,advertisement is a competition between many companies.",How can they make people buy them or how can they make their products look good.,0
1106499.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I disagree with this statement because there are a lot of ways to travel. You can travel alone or with a group, with a guide or without a guide, all of these depend on the motivations of your trip. I think the best way to travel will depend on the motivations of your trip. Maybe if you want to spend so much time quietly relaxing or maybe meditating, you will prefer travelling alone without a guide. The motivations for that kind of trip are only to relax and have a good time. Some people need this time, in this rush society where all the things pass very fast. Some people need space to enjoy themselves and have time to themselves. For these reasons I believe if you decide to have your time the best way to travel is alone. But the other way is if you want to enjoy yourself and take a trip for educational reasons you will choose to go with a group and guide. The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go to. In this occasion I think the best way to travel is in groups because in groups you can share ideas, information and you can learn in a social environment. Another example that illustrates my point is this: suppose two men decide to make a trip to El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico). The motivations of the first person are to have a good time with friends and explore all the forest, but the motivation of the second person is to have a good time reading in the high of the mountain. The first person will agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, but the second person will agree that the best way to travel is to be alone, without a guide. For me this example illustrated my point. This statement depends directly on the motivations or the intentions of the trip. I couldn't decide until I could figure out why I wanted to make this trip.","Perhaps I decided that the decision depends on your motivations, most of the time I choose travel in groups and in my experience I enjoy it a lot when I travel in groups.",0

In the old days, education was one of the important needs people might consider. That is because of the great enthusiasm young people might have towards accomplishing their responsibilities. For example, the percentage of failure in senior-high school was 30% in the Middle East between 1989-2000. However, between 2001-2006 the probability of failure has been highly increased to 70%. This statistic tells us that young people nowadays do not have the potential to accomplish their responsibilities, in order to respond to it in several generations after them.

There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius.","To sum up, the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things.",0
439975.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my personal opinion, I agree with the statement, that defines successful people as the person who tries new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know. I consider that successful people share this definition, in the sense, that people that do nt try new things, experiments, or adventures will suspend or shorten out their knowledge, converting them into not successful people and standard people. If you have that spirit of investigating, like in trying new ways of finding certain knowledge, you could consider yourself as a successful person. Another important thing, is that if you are scared of trying new experiments or new methods, that at first could seem rare or odd, you could never have the belief that you are going to succeed in life. If you study history, you could find some examples of scientists like Gramman Bell, Franklin and Mark Twain, who took many risks in their investigation and tried hundreds of times their experiment, here they never settled up. Now their discoveries and their knowledge are recognized world wide, and they were successful and recognized scientists.","This scientist never declines in their idea of investigating new things, this characteristic permits them to go beyond the other people that dont try or investigate new things.",0

1187884.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,I think that those people that try new things and take risks have more success than those that only do what they already know how to do well.,One of the many reasons is that people try new things in their lives because they are looking at how to be altruist and how to be successful.,0
1005053.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Everyone wants to know about the world around him or her for better understanding of different cultural back groundsand also to explore new things. This unquenchable desire for humans not only leads him to travel to different places on the earth but also to other parts of the universe. In the fast moving era everything in the world is constantly changing ,especially when it comes to time. Having a proper timetable is the most valuable key to a better life. So inorder to save my precious time i surely go on a trip with a. tour guide. If we go to a new place,its better if we have any local person who can call us to tell us about the history of that place. Mostly locals know better than the scholars who did research into that place. Because they will get all the information from their elders. Not only that the tour guide can also take visitors to different parts of the place from forests to rich green agricultural areas. In this way visitors can explore from wild animals to small beautiful local birds. Secondly, a tour guide can show more places in less time. Anyway it may take somuch time. I am saying this with my own experience.",In my college days we visited a place called Delhi.,0

So many other sayings were developed in the past related to this thing only like ""Little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" but they were the ones which were stated a long time back and are not valid today. Talking about the present scenario where success has become every man's need,a person who is just having knowledge on one subject can climb the stairs of a ladder that could lead him to a successful path. Its not bad to be focussed on but not salubrious in the current era. Focussing on one subject can have many diverse effects.",Having knowledge of one subject the job areas to which the person can apply will be restricted.,0

Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group. However, I personally prefer that when I go in a group, it must be led by the tour guide. Because tour guides have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in an interesting way and also werey to follow the group. Travelling in groups is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person who explains about the place in detail, i. e a tour guide. when we go to the new place, we have superficial information about the landmarks, museums etc. However the tour guide has detailed information about things like detailed history, importance and significance of that place.",Travelling is worthwhile if we get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money.,0

There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future.","Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars.",0
1741422.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops. Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body. They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool.",And so do their friends.,0

Because some old people are young , so they enjoy life. Also all ages have different surprises in life. When people are young, they can enjoy life so much. First of all, everyone must enjoy life every age, other wise you can bore in life. But when you are young, you can enjoy life more than everybody else. Because you want to try everything in the world. You want to go everywhere with your friends. When you are young, you have lots of energy to do something, you want to live life, you want to see everything. Sometimes you can learn some lessons about life. It can be good or It can be bad for you. Also, when you make lots of things, I will look for extra things. You want to live in city life.

1183664.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Yes, I agree with the sentence because most of the advertisements are false and they induce people to buy them when their quality is very low. The producers should think less about the sales than about the wealth of the people that will buy the product for example, if the product is food. The advertisement ought to be more strict to the reality to show to the watchers the real characteristics of each product. In this way a citizen can choose the best. In my opinion, all the producers will make their thoughts better and all the words said in an advertising space will be perceived and listened to better.","By the way I considered the advertising spaces a waste of time and I don't listen to them because, according to me, they are all made to seem like what they aren't.",0
1607000.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I think to be successful you don't need to do different things but to do things differently. Success and what are the essential ingredients which make a situation or a person successful? In simple terms, success is achieving goals with maximising efficiency. To set a goal for himself and envision the future is what successful men do differently. In life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of those decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally. How much a person is ready to take risks will determine how committed he is to his goals. Coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endeavour. I want to give an example of Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani who established the Reliance empire in less than a lifetime. He started his career in a gas station as a fuelman in some distant middle eastern country. He decided to quit his job there and come back to India and use Stock exchange to new heights. He has to his credit making the stock market familiar to the common man. The stock market did exist before his advent but the common man was quite aloof from it. He gained most of his financial strength from people's money. He also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business.",He was the most politically savvy businessman of his time which others never thought of using.,0
73721.txt,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do? yes, i agree with this opinion. Obviously, today we enjoy our lives more than the older generation, because we face a different time. First, with the development of our society, young people have more chance to learn about different life on this planet through TV programs, the internet or other media. A young man always has a great interest in new things. They like to enjoy different life and are eager to get more amazing experiences. For example, in china so many older people spend so much time caring for their grandchildren, or staying at home to watch TV. They always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again. but for young people, they can invite some friends to climb a mountain or drive a car to someplace, even though they have not much money. They do not want to waste their time when they are young. Second, as we all know, in china the older generation must work harder and harder, because our parents were not rich and they must earn more money to support their family. they spent their time working. when they want to enjoy the rest of life, they have already had no time or no interest in anything. but now so many young people have been born into good families, they can enjoy their life as they want, because their family can afford their consumptions. In recent years, so many young boys have been sent abroad to study by their parents. under the help of their parents, they can enjoy a new life in foreign countries, they can do anything if they want to. There is a big difference between young generations and older generations in china.","According to these examples , we found that young people live in more good conditions and good families.",0
1226973.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good. However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons. First of all, most students learn a lot of subjects in school and have exams in each semester. However, it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part. For example, I learned many subjects from academic institutions such as history, nuclear  physics, and pantam physics. But i am the president of an online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me. Second, people can learn from their peers and family about something like history, music or art. Most sportsmen who play in Major League Baseball in the United States and Premier League Soccer in the U. K.",in my country have learned their specific area for their life without studying a broad field.,0
436072.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. In my opinion, if you understand the concept, you always have time to learn facts or dates. In children's education, for example, it's important to give them instruments to understand nature and society. I think it's not so important to fill them with dates and facts. Moreover, if a child understands a concept, he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life. If he learns a fact without understanding it, he will forget it in a month. For example, i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old, just because my teacher explained the meaning of them. I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explanation of them. If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it, the children have no sense and don't pay attention to it. The same is true in adult education. In the university of medicine, for example, it is much more important to understand how to visit a patient, than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body.",You always have time to take a book and learn it.,0

Ofcourse, every single stage has its own nice moments. But this concept changes from time to time. For me, I think that young people enjoy it alot more than older people might do. For many reasons, the hardness of life will increase while being old because there will be many factors that interfere with the aging process. One thing is that, the duties for young people will be much lesser than those of older ones.","All young people have to do is go to university, which is considered a source of pleasure, and all that he has to do is pass it.",0
1114004.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them.","So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time.",0
1728651.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I love my car and can`t give up using it and I don ` t agree with the statement that says there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. I have three major reasons to say that. One of them is that newer types of car are being produced and the second is that transportation by car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that have to be made for people to transport The first reason for not agreeing with the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of car are being produced. These types include cars which work with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things. There are also plans to create cars which are flying near to the surface and this will provide a place for some more cars. The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars is very huge. There are other ways of transportation for example planes. They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople. Nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country advances. Cars are effective for transportation for many people The third reason for not agreeing with this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes. They should be very expensive changes, that are needed to compensate for the need for transportation of the increasing population of the world. Installing a new system is required and for this system many new research should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again. To conclude, as i stated in the reasons above there will be more cars than now in twenty years. One of them is newer car types and the second one is the efficiency of cars and the expense of the changes.",There is an air pollution problem because of the use of cars unfortunately but i believe if this problem is solved cars will be more critical and will be a better place in people'seyes.,0
283847.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with this. It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts. It is a more difficult thing than learning facts. First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts isn't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think most of the kids don't know which of these. Do you know why? Most parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of things. And that makes children interested. Second, the facts and concepts are more specific things.

1380444.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I disagree with the statement, and I do not believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. In twenty years the world will look very different than it is today. In the future there will be more technological advantages and companies will construct different types of transportation similar to cars. For example, there will be machines that can go over the earth and watter and fly into the air, and everyone can have one, because the cost to manufacture will be lower. Also, people want to go far away or faster, because their needs will change over time. Although this view of the future, there will be people that think in the environment, and people will prefer to use the bicycle or other means of transportation that don't cause a damage to the earth. If I can live in the future I think I will be below the group that protect the environment , and i will prefer to have clean air to a car. However, The perspective that I have of the future is a little negative, the industry grows really quickly, and technology helps in the development of the world, but it also helps in the destruction. The wants and needs of the people change, they want to have more electronic things to have an easier life. Also the time will be precious in the future, and they will need to have a car to go to jobs and meetings in a fast way.

I think understanding ideas and concepts is easier to understand, instead of just learning facts. When I study biology, and history in English, my tutor always gives me examples, and ideas.

1357482.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. First, we always choose the same product at the supermarket. For example, my friend always goes to the supermarket every Sunday, and he always buys the same snack. One day, I asked him, "" Why do you choose the same snack"". He answered that,"" I always watch this snack's commercial on television, then I think that this snack tastes good, so I always choose this one. ""I think that his favorite snack's taste is not good but he is influenced by television commercials , so he always chooses the same snack. Second, we always believe in the content of commercials. For example, two years ago, my sister bought an expensive natural food. My father asked my sister about,"" Why do you buy expensive natural food? ""My sister answered,"" According to this book, this food is good for us, so I buy this food. ""However, her natural food wasn't special natural food. Her book said that there was a lot of value in her natural food, but it was the same as normal food. She was influenced by the advertisement that included her book. Recently, there are many advertisements in the television commercials, radio commercials, magazines, books, newspapers, and so on. However, advertisements don't always show the correct information. The meaning of an advertisement is to sell a lot of goods, so when we buy any good, we should research a lot of information, and we should ask for opinions from family or friends. If we can collect a lot of information, we can choose the correct good. I think that correct information is more important than influence by advertising.","Before we choose good, we should remember this thing.",0
836337.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In general I think that both understanding conceps and learning facts are the two faces of the same medal. I will try to explain here below all the connections between concepts and facts especially in science terms. All the big scientific discoveries depend on the observation of facts, but on the other hand it is important to know all the theories related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of the facts we are observing. To give an order to this matter I think that first (in a temporary order, not for its importance) students need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts, so in the first part of students' formation it is necessary for them to learn as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the matter and after they can understand and remember much more easily all facts connected with their studies. for example if you are studying the atomic structure, of course you need to know everything about chemistry and related theories.","This example feats quite well to this essay, especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission.",0
1806306.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are three reasons in my opinion which led to the situation. First, there are too many amusing activities to do. New high-tech toys and recreations are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stuck on those things. Big companies use strong advertising and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spend time on the products. Moreover, interacting with friends takes most young people's time. All of these activities occupied every minute of them. Second, education from young people's parents does not give them the idea. To live in a competitive world, children are taught to learn knowledge as much as they can and give attention to other things as little as they can. Cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around. They are told to keep their hands from things that are helpless to their grades. Due to this twisted concept, young people are not interested in community activities. Third, the media broadcasts negative examples which stop young people from taking action. People refuse to give time to helping their communities because of bad news. A crazy person might hurt an unexperienced teenager while asking for help. Teenagers can be in trouble because of their lack of experience in helping the communities.","Above all, it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.",0

The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more.

This may feel that we are foreced to do it, but even though we are forced to do volunteering, I say we eventually help out the community. Young people nowadays don't only spend time helping their community but also spend a lot of time helping their country. Korea is a small country with no fossil fules or what so ever.

As a result, the performance in school has become more and more important. However the experience of helping communities will not be recorded in their grade. Meanwhile, Parents expect their children to focus on their studies. Students are not encouraged to help others. Children spend lots of time learning english, painting and music.

They may go to a dance hall every night to share a wonderful time with their friends,or sleep for an entire day just because it's comfortable. Young people are inexperienced,so they can try everything that they feel exciting. They may climb trees and hills, travel across rivers and oceans to experience the glory of nature. They may easily take bills that take all the money, because they got an idea to try a new thing,and then they think it's worthwhile. Young people are confident,they will do every thing that they want to do.","They may just have a little company with a little money,and then try their best to make it gloomy.",0

In my opinion, Successful people try new things and they might be success. they always research new things and make a lot of money. Korea has some international companies. Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia, Fila. etc. They tried new things and took risks. For example. Samsung had to choose the future industry between memory chips and the airplane industry. and finally when they choose the memory industry, Almost people worried about that. because Samsung did not have any other know-how and information. But now Samsung is very famous for memory. and electronic hardware. But successful people can not always win the risk. Sometimes They get into trouble with financial problems. even their company can not stand anywhere. For example, The samsung owner Lee, Kwun-hee likes cars so much. He is famous for car mania. So, He decided to make a Samsung car company. Before he founded his company, There were three big car companies in korea. Kia, Hyundai, and Daewoo. So he could not win this game. but he founded a car company. The company lose their game. and the effect was suffered by samsung's owner. I know some examples of this situation.",Successful people or normal people can try new things and take their risks.,0
1774785.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly disagree that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts. Currently, A lot of people do nt have a lot of time as much as a long time ago. Therefore, time has become very important in our student life. Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example. I saw the information through a diagram of smart people,When some journalist asked a question about how they studied? Most people who made good score people said ""I used to spend a lot of time thinking hard.","In my conculsion, Through our life, time becomes the most important thing in our social life.",0

As a matter of fact it is by willingness that they have reached their goals, and having goals, dreams is already risky.

Success goes with risk, if you do not try to do anything, and then stay with what is secure for you, you will never be successful.","If you are already successful it will be easier for you to try plenty of new things, because you are sure of what you have already achieved.",0

Actually, i used to dream of these kinds of cases when I was involved in environmental friendly social services. Our goals were to advertise the air pollution of cars and encouraging people to use public transport. By that time, I sometimes had that feeling one day, cars should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly. Likewise, the place i'm living now Singapore is a very country which has succeeded in reducing the number of cars.

216699.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three reasons for this. First, the goal of a company is to sell the product. Second, advertising makes people buy their product in an individual way. A company which owns the product's goal is making their profit and that way, the company makes people think that the product is necessary for them. The company's goal is to sell as many of their products as they can. Therefore, people who are making an advertisement make it look better than the real product and use it in the advertisement. For example,. in the Taco Bell advertisement, the half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town. Advertisements make people think that the product is a necessary item. A few days ago, I saw an Old Navy commercial, They kind of made me think that if I didn't wear their jeans, I just didn't belong to our younger men's community. So, I bought the product but It looks the same as the jeans I got two months ago.",The advertisement is for a company which is selling the product's profit and it makes most people think that the product is what they need.,0

1959261.txt,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits. I have more positive experiences of travelling with a group than travelling alone. So i like to travel with groups led by a tour guide. Travel with a group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensive. Usually for group travel , one will take care of the ticketbooking, hotel reservation etc. The group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay. So i don't need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress. Last year,I visited India with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free. My group leader organized travel and reservations and my tour guide took me to all the important places. The guide will take the group and show everything that the group needs to see in that area. In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for the next day's events. This is so time saving. This way, i can concentrate on other things like enjoying my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meeting new friends at the party etc. Group travel is safer.",All ways you have some one along with you and take care of them if needed.,0
751687.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce.","So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are.",0

1717252.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate. I reason when people hear about a product they should research on the internet or something like that. It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already. Maybe they can get more than money.","I think most of the advertisement lies because my mother always says this one, ""if your merchants are good you do not have to call somebody to come around you and take my product.",0
1123014.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because,when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself. When a student has understood a certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself. By understanding it the student will be able to answer any type of question on that topic. For example let us consider that a student is studyingmotor. The student needs to understand the main idea and what the concepts are that are related to that topic. And how the motor works and many more things about the motor. But,less importance should be given to learning facts. Let us consider another example, let us consider one of the topic from the student subjects. The student must know what is the main idea and the concepts of that particular topic rather than learn facts on that particular topic.

People want to get more things from life. People use a lot of ideas to create the things that they want. However, we know most adversisements make products seem much better than they really are. Many companies have made many DM and advertisements to attract their customers. For the company, they just want people to buy their products. The advertisements are just a way to present their thoughts. However, the real product is not really like the advertisement. The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thoughts to their customers. Maybe they did not talk about how to use the products any more. They want the climents to keep their eyes on them. That is business. On the other hand, now there are many companies that sell their stuff in the TV show. They provide the time to use their products. If the customer does like the products that they can return to the company.","From this time, the company really hope their customers know and to use their products.",0
1569573.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination. of course every idea can be based onfacts. but sometimes it's wrong because students have to try to think of things someyears ago. many schools force students to study with formulas and memorize only facts. they didn't allow students to speak their opinions freely. but these days, many systems have changed in school. they encourage students' creative activity. when childhood is important to students they don't know much about society and the future and around many things. Free thinking can be helpful in our society. these thinking can produce a more advanced future. just to learn the facts and memorize them block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can. for example , i read the book a few days ago after reading the book i agreed with it. the book includes information about French education. the children learn mathematics in school they have to solve the problem but they can't count the number well. when they learned mathematics they were focussed on remembering the formula and they always studied the same questions. sometimes they faced higher problems but they also depended on the formula.","so, oneday their homeroom teacher asked them ""which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2?

In my opinion,If there are two people in the same work position. The better man is always the one who spends more time helping other people. God always helps the one who loves and helps other people. The one who loves to spend more time helping people. He will get feedback from others. You never know when other people will feedback on your help.

466340.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Every one knows that when we are learning we learn facts and ideas. No one in the world can change the facts because facts are facts. Some people just like to know the facts and they do not pay attention to other ideas. In my case, I strongly believe that understanding ideas is more important for students than understanding facts. I think like this because of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respond to others, it makes you creative and makes you persuasive. First, understanding ideas opens up very good and big ways of thinking. It makes you think and respect other people's opinions. If we look at facts, we will find that most of thefacts were just ideas in the past and by discussing them they become facts. Second, trying to understand ideas is a good way to make your brain work. It makes you create new ideas and new opinions. On the other hand, understanding facts is like opening your mind, putting things in it and closing it. Third, understanding ideas led you to the facts. I believe that most of the facts are conclusions to ideas. If you understand the idea you can easily figure out the fact. I think understanding ideas teaches us how to be a persuasive person because when you are trying to get a result from an idea, you are following certain and clear steps. This certain way of thinking can appear in your personality. Finally, I believe that understanding ideas is very important but also we can not say understanding facts is not important. We should know the main and important facts of every thing. On the other hand, we do not make understanding facts our way of learning and thinking.","I believe that because of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respect others, it makes you creative and makes you persuasive.",0

622671.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"This is not completely true. Indeed, I think that success is achievable in both ways. Some people build emperors doing the same thing all life long, quite as a south-italian farmer emigrated to Canada after World War II. In Italy he was a well known mozzarella producer, and once he established himself in Canada he began the same activity, with the same method, day after day, and now he is one of the richest men in the country, exporting his famous mozzarella throughout North America. Maybe nowadays in such a competitive market this kind of experience has become rare, because of globalization involving all the 5 continents that causes the rise of new competitors everywhere and because of the growth of multinational companies with uncountable capital. What is interesting is that in this statement' is that in our own life, fossilizing ourselves is a practice to avoy. A new idea, a different vision of life, the market, and so on, can cause a sudden success in our work place, family, group of friends or even in our school, and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position in this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study, to find a job, to be competitive in a single word. A clear example of this situation is the advertising world. How can I convince people to buy my product? how can i make them understand that my product is better than others? With ads obviously, but we are surrounded by ads! In the streets, on television, on the radio, on the newspapers, on the web, during sports events, everywhere basically, and as a consequence of this, people no longer pay attention to ads. So an advertiser must find something new, something that attracts the attention of the crowd, and so he has to take risks, to innovate his approach.","Who stands in his position too long, will fail for sure.",0
504053.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is important or learning the facts. Because every thing in our life ca not be understood through the ideas and concepts that need more creative minds. firstly when we talk about ideas and concepts these are sometimes easy to understand but some times very typical to understand. And this also depends on the type of mind that the student has. and understanding ideas and concepts also depends on the way we have brought in our life. because if a student is restricted to certain things in his childhood then he ca not have a creative mind. and if everything is understood through ideas then there will be a more number of scientists than normal people on the earth. And the other thing we have to talk about is learning facts that is learning throughexperiences. and everything we cant experience because if we think wearing a helmet can be implemented after facing any problem then its just like taking a chance in our life. and every thin cant be learned through facts because every thing cant be a fact in our life.,because it is difficult to get every thing as a fact.,0

So inorder to save my precious time i surely go on a trip with a. tour guide.

To begin with, people can devote themselves to their own society in different manners. Without spending lots of time working for others, they can dedicate themselves to the communities.

1114004.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you. The main point is not to think only about ourselves. Everybody has to care about other people or even animals too. If one does something wrong or not right , one day someone can do it back to us.",We will never forget this.,0

I believe eventhough i spend most of my timestudying, i give time to helping my community. is it enough? I think this statement is both true and not true for different reasons. it is true in a way that we don't do our best. we can spend a lot more time making our city a better place. we can take part actively in activities. Also, we can spend more time with the elderly. we can do this by carefully planning our spare time. but usually we choose to relax and be with our friends when we have time. one of the reasons for this is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before. almost everything in our lives can be done with professionals. because of this people less interfere in each other's lives. on the other hand its true that we are doing whatwe can. even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the community. I do not have time but when I see my neighbours I ask them If they need anything. I live in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters. I ask them if they need anything when I am going to the market or for example. If something is going on in front of my eyes i do not close my eyes, i interfere and help. If I am not aware of what can i do about it? I think this sentence is both true and not true from different views.

In my opinion, people should focus on one topic and specialize in it. By having deep information and significant experiences on an issue, people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job, salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area. The first advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compared to other people. Because, companies today generally look for people with a specific topic. The reason for this is that today's companies are working on a detailed subject. It is clearly seen that there are not so many companies that work in different areas. Therefore, this situation pushed the companies to find people that have important experiences and knowledge about their job.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well.",That means that it is so competitive in that area.,0

1989574.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Time is the key point that is to be considered in one's life the young people focus their time mainly on education and other physical activities but they rarely focus on the development of the community. I agree with the statement because when we consider the example of the college student he spends most of his time on studying rather then on the welfare or development of the community. Mainely the reason lies in his thinking of what the community has done for him,that is if there is a favour that has been done to him by the community then he would probably think of returning it. At a young age, people focus or think on making a living or exploring the resources that give them opportunity to make money and settle in life ,but they forget to think that by developing the community in which they live they can gain more business and develop at a faster rate because the development or success of an individual not only depends on the efforts that are being made by him but also on the surroundings, that is his community and his surroundings.",At a young age the way of thinking is far different as people think more practically and the way of approach to a problem is far more different.,0
1928452.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People, especially those who would like to make a success in their life, discuss whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just keep what they already have a knowledge to make a better life. I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life. For example, the SamSung company which is specialized in the electronic field such as TV, computers and semiconductor products worldwide has been researching new markets and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result, it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people. If the company still enjoyed stability, today's successful story would not exist. Further more, the companies which exploit the well of crude oil always try to find new resources by investing large amounts of money with huge risks.","For these efforts, it deserved to get a lot of reputation and accumulate a fortune.",0
1042567.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"These days, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. yes i agree with this. because the main point is they have no interest in helping others. some young people are giving enough time to help their communities. because they are interested in that. but these days young people are interested in going to the cinema whereas to help others. they are spending more time and more money on the enjoyable entertainment. but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends have enough time to help my communities. we spend time doing that when we are free. So, now a days, young people prefer to enjoy themselves with their friends, familyand with others rather than to help in the communities. the young people should help the community. because it is very beneficial for communication and society. The main idea is that we help the community,by seeing our younger friends or any one,they may try to help the community. so that this will be increased by seeing one another. Finally, it supports the community. the help for the community is the main idea of me. because now adays no one is preffering to help others. because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a little bit of selfishness. so that they cant help the community. the young people now a days prefer to enjoy themselves rather than to help the community. if young people help the community the community will become good. the helping nature of the people should grow from childhood only. because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also. if it does not grow it is impossible to help at a young age.",the young people these days are very joyous people.,0

First, If anything this is a delightful era unlike the period our parents got through the difficult time in the past. There are many activities and resources that old people can enjoy around us in this contemporary era. For example, we , recently can meet some movies focused on old people and it is a most remarkable change in our culture considering the fact that the movies usually belong to younger people. And we can also know that there are many active communities built by the old and for the old. These facilities , absolutely help them to enjoy their life.","Secondly, I am compelled to emphasize the improvement and the development of the medical area.",0
1088494.txt,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertising has always been an interesting discussion topic for people. some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders. on the other hand, there are also some people who think that advertising really has alot to do. and I think, I would be counted in the second group. Advertising may make anything better by a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be the fascination towards the product. and looks matter alot. for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you. isn't it? that is where advertising comes into the picture. Its magic of advertising. Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. as we all know, that anything in this world is not perfect. All things have dark sides too. So, with a little help from advertising, we can highlight the positive points of some products and can hide the negative parts. for instance, lets take the example of cold drinks like, cola, pepsi etc. these drinks are so popular among people. but the question is why are they? while we know that these drinks are not good for your health. even then they do a great deal of business all over the world. The credit of this should go to the advertising. advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular.

715496.txt,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","There are many cars used today. I believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years. The first reason that there will be fewer cars in twenty years is that the pollution issue is highly concerned by people. Organizations are now devoted to raising people's concern about the pollution problem. Particles produced by cars are one of the main sources of air pollution. As air pollution will harm human beings and people are concerned about their health, they take the pollution problem seriously. In order to tackle the problem, people will no longer use private cars to travel, but use public transport instead. Travel by public transport is more environmentally friendly, therefore, fewer private cars will be used. As people become more concerned about the environment, the number of cars will decrease in the twenty years.","Additionally, technology progresses very fast nowadays.",0

Some people say that the numbers will decrease because alternative transportation will be popular in the future. However, I firmly believe that cars' occupation will increase because of the lack of technology and economic growth. Firstly, the technologies to make other good modes of transport are not developed yet. Although modern technology has developed to a higher point, it is hard to make more economical and popular transportation than cars in twenty years. In the future, other modes of transport such as sky-train will appear, but not in twenty years. Besides, economics are growing consistently to the extent to support non-wealthy people, These will make most people afford to and maintain their cars. It is a similar result to computer occupation. Ten years ago, there were low rates of having computers. However, now, almost every house has one or more cuputers. According to research by the Administration of Transportation of Korea, the number of cars in Korea has increased by 400 percentage points in the past twenty years.",This shows that the car occupations will enhance.,0
465959.txt,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the topic. Young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities. Even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading. They really show up and help when the time comes for doing that. Consider the example of Katrina hurricane. The hurricane left many people homeless and made many children orphans. During that time students and other young people through out the world gave help. Students have established many camps around the victimized areas to help the people. Many people from foreign nations have also helped their best by donating their pocket money. Even though many of the students are busy with their college schedule, they devote some time to social service. Many students from clubs in their college help the underprivileged kids and others. This I am stating from my personal experience. I am a member of a rotract club in college. Me along with some other students have arranged a camp in college to encourage the underprivileged kids. We went to an orphanage and brought a few kids to our college and gave them training in sketching, fabric painting, clay modelling etc. We have this program once in a semester and the members of the group work for two to three days on it.",Even though many companies do have a charity trust to help the community.,0
758953.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"No, i disagree, that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject Specialization is highly preferred according to me because knowledge is like anocean. What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean,so it is impossible to pursue in many acedamics. The better way is to take a single subject. We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialize. They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less time. They can also share that knowledge with the younger generation in a better way because of their high confidence levels in the subject. After finishing their studies, it will be easier for a specialised person to choose his path. He will be preferred to others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that particular field. He gets the skills of innovation , works hard ,and tries to concentrate on his subject. since he is free to choose the subject of interest he will pursue with zeal and eagerness. He will be more clear about his future plans.

As the generation changes took place, the comfort and the benefits also have been increased in modern society, So i would strongly condemn the saying that the number of cars will be decreased in the course of the next twenty years. There might be many adverse environmental consequences due to the peculiar emissions of harmful gases and finding short of the resources of the petrol products, but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere future. Since,as technology improves soures will alsoimprove, and the next generation cars will be battery operated or bio cars. This would be the best substitute for the cars which are running today. The other main purpose for which, the number of cars would be increasing is that, the population on the earth is increasing day by day, it would be very difficult for mass transportation to transport as many people as there are , therefore many people would have an eye towards the cars which would lead them towards them. In this fast growing society, cars do play a major significant role, as they do be very helpful for quicker transportation, because time once lost cannot be regained, and for the world twenty years from now, time will play a very prominent role. There are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars, which would become a major resource for growing the usage of cars in the future. By using this type of car, they have many advantages like the faster mode of transportation, which not only improves one's only status but improves the whole economic development of the country.

236812.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society. From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is because he does not know about the realities. If he had already learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into a puzzle. In addition, students always get more interest in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts. Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt to society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already knew the facts. Besides, students can also use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas. In summary, it is obvious that ideas and concepts are much more important for students to learn than just understanding for the reason of the clearness of the reality, student's interests in the subject and the benefits for their future. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that students should learn facts from the ideas and concepts.",It is very good for their mental health.,0
381881.txt,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,Yes i agree with the concept of discussing that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

Most of the students understand the idea so that they can do things better and get a grip on that particular idea and also they can learn more things about the idea they learnt.,"For example a student preparing for his exams is coming over in a few days, to get rid of that he must read properly so that he does not forget that he prepared for the exams, so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need to mug up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam.",0
1166105.txt,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"So different are personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions. As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better.","Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions.",0

1267483.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"""You should go to school, learn a lot of different things. "" That is what parents often said. But I do not completely agree with the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In deed,I support the view that specialization is a good thing. So, people know what they are talking about. In some fields, like men who built houses, specialization is necessary : how could someone as good at painting as a wood table? Furthermore, it implies a longer study if you want to have broad knowledge. Moreover, if someone has broad knowledge, I think it is impossible that he knows accurately all his many academic subjects he has even learned. This is a great problem, there are not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity. You need to be very smart, like Leonard from Vinci. He is a good example. Nevertheless, in contrast to my first explanation, it is important too, to have people who know a little bit about everything. Important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referants between specialists. And because of their knowledge, they will be able to resolve problems and manage a team. That's why they have a great adaptability. To conclude with this statement, i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists.",They both complain about themselves.,0
1703643.txt,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with this statement that ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects"". As per my view looking at present day science , it is better to have a lot of knowledge of many subjects. As science is in a phase of revolution and today's necessities that people should have an interdisciplinary person. Another point is that using a multidimensional approach to solve any problem. Firstly, now a days it's time for revolution and renovation. Since, time is changing and we are in the 21st century, so we have rebuilt many concepts because today science has achieved so much and technology is also in very good condition. We also have to find out some answers to many questions which are not solved yet. Therefore, we have to gain knowledge of many subjects to improve our ideas. Secondly, we should try to get enrolled in various new and interdisciplinary subjects. Here I want to say that at present time we should try to get acceptance in various new subjects and it's much better to take an Interdisciplinary subject. By studying an interdisciplinary subject, we can gain knowledge of a variety of subjects. For example, applied sciences can provide a vast knowledge of various subjects, which we can't get from any specialized subject. Another example may be in Bioinformatics, where we learn and read various subjects such as Biology, Computersciences, Information technology, Maths, Statistics, Physics and Chemistry. So I think this type of student can work much better and can handle various types of problems. Thirdly, a multidisciplinary approach can solve some critical problems. At present, it is a very nice idea to be a multidimensional person. For example, in any research institute there is a problem which involves Physics, Mathematics and Biology, then here is a problem that not any person knows all the things so here a person having multiple subjects knowledge can do well. So that we can make a model and can solve a problem without any problem. Therefore, I can say on the basis of these some points that it is better to have a knowledge of various subjects.",Means jack of all trades.,0

In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and wastes a lot ofmoney. For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one).
