1,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Understanding ignorance is far more important than knowing the facts. understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher. humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the facts from the early stone age we understand concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubbing two stones together thus understanding the process of combustionby using stones. we cant simply rely on the subject by knowing but for understanding it. for example every one knows about the law of conservation of energy,a person who understands applied in the form of electricity or mechanical engine. A student who got good marks in an examination ca not become a good engineer or doctor or infact, be good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good. Thus, application is important for a student who comes with an understanding of the subject. A practical understanding of the subject is preferred rather than simply knowing it ,this is the reason why nowadays education orl study is based on formal work rather than simply class room teaching. each and every course of today whether you take a science or art or technology project and the field work isintroduced. The concept of understanding does not give us success in profession but also helps us get better in our subjects which we do not want to get for our lifetime. this doesnt happen simply by knowing. a student should not apply this to the study but also to the various aspects ofdaily life. this can better not only a person's life but also his relations with other people thus ultimately his life stands are also increased. this aspect cannot be overlooked. Opposing side should be made to be taught in the schooling stage itself. finally understanding makes perfect not only good academically but also in life. fe.","[""Understanding ignorance is far more important than knowing the facts. understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher. humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the facts from the early stone age we understand concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubbing two stones together thus understanding the process of combustionby using stones. we cant simply rely on the subject by knowing but for understanding it. for example every one knows about the law of conservation of energy,a person who understands applied in the form of electricity or mechanical engine.

Following middle and high school, you may learn various things through many kinds of subject. After that, you could find your specific talent or concern, dedicate yourself to that. It means learning basic and common things first, and then concentrating on something special chosen after that. Second, it's my regrettable story. I neglected studying when I was a high school student. As a result of that, I selected the wrong major which was mechanical engineering for my bachelor's degree.

Recent activities such as new programs which aim to encourage people to use their creativity in the projects.

7,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products. However, in my opinion, I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are three following reasons which can prove and give more examples for my personal opinion. The most important reason I think is that advertisements know what consumers think when theyare shopping. The outside of looking of products is the most important point people will think about buying the products. Therefore the advertisements spend more time designing what kind of look better for products then the time which they spend designing the inside of products. These points can help companies to get more money because they dont have to spend too much time on the inside of product design, and customers feel interested in products coming, so they buy them. Producing inside of products easier than making good design for outside looking is the second important reason which I have chosen to put here. I was doing a research paper which is about disguising how many times people usually spend on designing a new car. The research shows me that designing a new car engine should take more then five years at the least.","[""Some people think that most advertisements don't make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the appearance of products is more important than the quality of the products.

I believe that one should surely possess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career.

17,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","The statement affirms that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies. On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them. The second compromise would be with the environment, trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but, of course, trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to pollution problems But on the other hand , we can also view the coin by the other face. Even if technology can be improved during the next twenty years, it will be very difficult for normal people to achieve all the advances. In that case, in the non-developed countries and maybe in many developing countries, cars could keep their own place as the main means of transport. It is not too difficult to think about the implementation of the changes in the case of Africa, the poorest continent of the world.

There are many countries with problems in that particular area that have been trying to solve them, such as Italy, Spain and France. and they failed.

Tokyo Motorshow.","['The statement affirms that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be, for the next twenty years, the goals of the governments and their population, and why not the private companies. On the one hand, It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport, for example. In that case, and only in that case, it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now. That possibility implies that governments will have at least to make strong compromises. One would be with its own population, trying to offer them different effective means of transport for all of them. The second compromise would be with the environment, trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but, of course, trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to pollution problems But on the other hand , we can also view the coin by the other face. Even if technology can be improved during the next twenty years, it will be very difficult for normal people to achieve all the advances. In that case, in the non-developed countries and maybe in many developing countries, cars could keep their own place as the main means of transport. It is not too difficult to think about the implementation of the changes in the case of Africa, the poorest continent of the world. Even in Europe could not be possible to erase or to decrease the number of cars in the next twenty years.

According to this phrase, I think that people who try to do new things normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who simply does his/her usual job. What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to society. A lot of men can do things well, but only men who do things better than others can reach a higher level in social life. Taking risks is part of being a successful person. Someone who does not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by society. For example, in cartoons, a superhero is someone who normally takes risks to do something more dangerous than other normal people do.","['As my boss used to say to me at the beginning of my career: < Do not be afraid to try new things, do more than others do: no one has ever been punished for doing more>.

20,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days. But personally I believe that education and society give young people the chance and the time to have contact with communities to help other people. First, the school focuses on the importance of volunteer work in the community these days, so that students give more time to do volunteer work than before. For example, when I was in high school, the teachers set up the volunteer committee which gives the information and chance to do volunteer work in the hospital to clean the rooms. In addition, the school produced an event where students pick up the trash around the school once a week. The experience of attending volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students. That experience gives me the chance to have contact with my community. I was very busy studying, but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities. According to the newspaper, the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer work these days. This example demonstrates that schools make enough opportunities for students to help their communities. Second, the community has a chance for young people to help their communities. For instance, In Tokyo, where I live, the number of robberies and fire accidents caused by people is increasing.","['Certainly some people think that young people seldom participate and help the communities these days.

Second because a lot of time people buy a particular product not for its quality but only for its mark. For example we can think about food: what are the differences between one biscuit to another? A lot of the time the difference is the price: the product that is well-known is more expensive than the other, but if we taste the quality we can' t understand the difference because they are equal. Another example that I could consider is about clothes. There are a lot of people that want to wear only one type of, for example, trousers because there is a little spot on them. Probably it is only to be fashionable, but this traffic, which costs a lot, isn' t different from another. The last consideration that I can do is that advertisements hit our unconscious attitude and so a lot of the time we choose products that are published in an unconsciously way.

In each place, in each situation we are covered by advertisements. It is easy to ask ourselves if the products that are presented are so brilliant.

34,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Most advertisements make products much better than they really are except tobacco and medicine advertisements. In tobacco advertisements, they always express bad images of tobacco. Outside the package of tobacco, they write about concern about cancer with tobacco. In the advertisements for tobacco, we can see bad images of tobacco, but many smokers don't stop smoking in spite of these advertisements. My friends watch these advertisements for tobacco everyday, but keep smoking. The advertisements for medicine have a restriction, so a medicine company can't use an expression which tells more effects than it really are. But about other products besides tobacco and medicine, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the TV commercials, beautiful women and handsome men use these products in sophisticated places happily. And also we can listen to fun commercial music which makes the images of these products better. Sometimes famous movie stars appear in the commercials and tell us how these products are great and useful. There TV commercials are broadcast on TV several times a day, and finally we remember the names of these products unconsciously. Advertising companies try to make commercials which impress good and strong images of these products to customers. In Japan, commercials with comedy touch are fashionable. In these advertisements , famous comedians say funny words to impress the product customers during the commercials Customers unconsciously remember the funny words. Children tell the funny word in their school and laugh with friends.","[""Most advertisements make products much better than they really are except tobacco and medicine advertisements.

35,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops. Nobody can say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free, but a certain brand tries to provoke this picture by showing landscapes, cowboys and horses. Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back. But often people don't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they don't have the knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they read. Of course not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might cause our health. And that is one of the points I really think is unfair from the producing firms. To sell bigger quantities of their product, they willingly make people believe wrong things. Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body. They just want to do, have, eat or drink everything they are told is good, brandnew, cool. And so do their friends. Concluding my essay I would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even 'most' as is written in the statement. It would be unfair to declare advertisements to be generally false, dishonest or dangerous. There definitely are advertisements which state the truth about their product! Many adversitements even show a horrible content and can be really amusing.","[""With the above made statement, i fully agree for the following reasons: The best example would probably be the tobacco advertisements shown on TV, in the cinema or as large posters at bus stops.

Every experience will be like a surprising gift and every friend will be your valuable fortune in your life. The best thing to explore the world on your own is to create memories by yourself. Some people would think it's convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spots right away. That way, you don't have to waste too much time finding places. And even the tour guide could explain the information or historic stories to let you know without a book. Actually, the tour guide nowadays only shows the travelers to the spots where they can make money. The rush schedule and the arrangement by a tour guide will ruin the true meaning of travel. Most people usually feel physically tired and empty in their mind.","[""I don't agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

They do not worry, if they can help an old lady to cross the street. Focusing on their own aims is very important. In addition they only live, because they want to enjoy their lives. They do not look for people, who need help. I think, that young people should be asked or even forced, if they do not want to help other people. On the whole most young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. Working in a hospital for a low price can help to remind people, especially young people, that they will become older. For sure, they are forced to see a lot of diseases, for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness.","['Nowadays most young people care a lot about their own problems.

50,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits. I have more positive experiences of travelling with a group than travelling alone. So i like to travel with groups led by a tour guide. Travel with a group is more stress free, organized, safe and less expensive. Usually for group travel , one will take care of the ticketbooking, hotel reservation etc. The group will decide when its time to start, which place is nice to stay. So i don't need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress. Last year,I visited India with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free. My group leader organized travel and reservations and my tour guide took me to all the important places. The guide will take the group and show everything that the group needs to see in that area. In this way, i don't need to spend my whole evening planning for the next day's events. This is so time saving. This way, i can concentrate on other things like enjoying my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meeting new friends at the party etc. Group travel is safer.","[""Travelling alone or with a group will depend on one's personality and travelling habits.

51,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I believe that I can state this position through presenting the career of some of my friends. Observing their works and characteristics, most of them are challengers, who always like to try different things from others and like to invent something new that no one has ever thought of. If they believe that one project that has been planned very well based on their planned strategy through their experiences and collaborations co-works, they are not afraid of taking risks of loosing their fonds. I have a friend that has been working for the health sector which specializes in HIV/AIDS for many years in the world. I would like to say that she is a sufficiently successful person, considerate in her profession and her economic status that can live on her own. Still continuing working for the HIV/AIDS issue in the international organization, but she has currently started to organize one project with her friends, which is very new here in Panama. The project is combined with animal therapy and small notion of HIV. My friend has never had a pet.","['I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

52,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I strongly agree with the statement, as i personally experience the feeling. In life we need to enjoy every part, though it is related to money, adventure, drama etc. Elders are always frightened as they always think of the future rather than the present. But youngsters are really bothered about the future. For example when i am at school i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me, but finally they sent me with more caution. After comming back, they saw my video of my bangee jump on tour and started scolding me though i safely came back. They are always more curious in life and they never try for any adventure. I feel adventure is also part of enjoyment. Spending money is economy for elderly people but for young people money doesnt matter for enjoyment. when i started earning, i started spending for my own expenses, like restaurants, outings with friends, enjoying weekends, but my parents did nt like this as they wanted me to save money for my future. I feel that we need to enjoy it when we have the opportunity, as time never comes back. We can earn money through out our life. Youngsters like dressing in a modern way as per their comfort whereas elderly people feel that young people need to maintain their tradition but i feel dressing in modern does not mean that we are loosing our tradition.","['I strongly agree with the statement, as i personally experience the feeling.

54,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because,when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself. When a student has understood a certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself. By understanding it the student will be able to answer any type of question on that topic. For example let us consider that a student is studyingmotor. The student needs to understand the main idea and what the concepts are that are related to that topic. And how the motor works and many more things about the motor. But,less importance should be given to learning facts. Let us consider another example, let us consider one of the topic from the student subjects. The student must know what is the main idea and the concepts of that particular topic rather than learn facts on that particular topic. When the student is focused on understanding the ideas and concepts on a particular topic. When we arise any doubts about those topics they will be able to answer that doubt.

Our common sense is not to try towad risk area. however, No trying new things means no new happening in our lives. As I read this statement, I remember the pastor Cho's story who established the full gospel church in Seoul. He started a small church in the country side which lived with many poor people. As his ministry grew, he moved to a bigger church. His church number was around 1000 numbers. God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 people. He didn't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time. He couldn't see any reasonable things to start it. It was big risk. It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church. But His church number became over 700,000 numbers because the location of the church was built, became the core of the city of seoul. All so important buildings such as the building of the national broad casting and government , were established there. The other reason is that most people try to do what they know well. That means that it is so competitive in that area. If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others, it is rare to achieve success. Let's think about one example.

56,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life. Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success. People who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways. These are the following reasons. Firstly,if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time, then it is not about being successful,but about being lucky. The best example of this is Thomas Edison. He tried to find the electricity for several times,but he did not think that he would not be able to invite it. He always tried and tried. He said that,`I have tried millions of times to find the electricity,but I never gaveup trying. I am happy that I can know the ways which I can`t be successful withthis finding. `It means,taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way. He managed it because he took all the risks on this way. In addition to this,taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do. If someone wants to cook very well,then they need to make distasteful foods first. People need to try new things. Furthermore,in schools. Teachers ask questions of their students. Someone,who is not sure about the answer,can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question. Even if the solution that the student did is wrong,this is the best way of learning the right thing for students. Especially in Mathematics classes. Even though I was not sure about the solution,I always wanted to try to solve it and I was always the volunteer. Last but not least,the way which goes to succeed is not always clear,there are often difficulties. For example,someone wants to study abroad,brings everything in his back and goes to the country where he will study. In this situation,he takes a risk of losing all his relationships with friends and even with his family. Moreover,he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country. If he needs help,then there is nobody at the first times when he goes to this country.","['Mankind always needs to succeed to achieve good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of human life.

I thought that it was totally ridiculous and I paid money in vain. We couldn't even enjoy things that we could have. It is not a good memory for me but a worthless exhausting trip. There is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, It just gets rid of my interests in the touring places.

There is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, It just gets rid of my interests in the touring places. A tour guide tells us everything, and we should go to places only where the tour guide leads us. There can be many things that I am going to get interested in that the tour guide is going to miss out on.

63,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue. Different people have different opinions due to their respective experience. On the one hand, some people argue that young people nowadays should volunteer to help their communities. On the other hand, others believe that young people don't have to help their communities because they don't have enough time so far. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In the following discussions, I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints. First of all, most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars' information, friendships, and so on. It usually makes them not have enough time to help their communities. In other words, they usually care about themselves more than others. For example, if you talk about what happened to the famous star recently, they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes, and being attractive in their appearances. There are so many attractive things to worth paying attention to. Second, most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they don't understand how their communities work. They have little contact with their communities. As a result, they don't know get a whole understanding with their communities. At the same time, most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually, even unfriendly. Finally, most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships. That is to say, in the present development of society, there are a lot of pressures in our life, most of them focus on the incoming benefits which they earned as soon as possible. They don't want to give more. Most young people want to lead a luxurious life and pursue the dreams that they really want to in the future.","[""There are certain considerations or factors which everyone takes into account when considering the issue.

They want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product. Advertisements should not only emphasize the goodness of their product, furthermore they stress a character given by the advertisement. For example, when there is a company advertising entertaining things like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisement during the commercial breaks. It is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisement is correct or not, the only important thing is that they get the people's attention and may achieve interest in watching their show. The only thing advertising does is because of money. Money rules the world.","[""I completely agree with this statement. The main reason for advertising is to sell their product on the market.

79,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. To sell a product, it has to have good promotion, advertisements sell the product because while showing the promotion of the product, the y are showing the best product ever, when sometimes it's just a big lie and sometimes it's the truth. The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market. There is a background behind a product, and belonging to a company. The product that is already on sale has an enormous study before getting to the store. Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time they pass through, by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about. The best way to sell could be by improving your product just by very tiny changes like making the product wantable, but not changing the product, just making people interested, curious and this will make people buy the product, this is a great way of doing a sell.

81,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think it depends on the age of the student. For young students, like secondary and high school it will be more important to know about ideas and concepts. Students at this age are still at the beginning stage or we can say learning state. They will learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future. They may even learn from what is happening in history. By learning theories, students will think about what will happen in the application of the theory. While the older students, at university for example, have to learn more facts. They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get. Without ideas or concepts, students will not know whether it is right or not. Older students should apply the theories they get in real life. Then, by knowing the results, new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results. This will be a worthwhile experience for students For example, they are two kinds of cost in production, fixed and variable cost. Fix cost should not be changed at any sum of productions. But when we increase or quantity any certain level, the fixed cost will change. Thus, ideas or concepts and facts support each other. Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts. Because some of the facts may come from ideas or concepts. The plane that can fly is a fact.","['I think it depends on the age of the student. For young students, like secondary and high school it will be more important to know about ideas and concepts.

Likewise, we can consider Darwin and his theory against creavitism. Besides, being historically proved our intrinsic cruveness always leads us to try new things.

Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confident in their interview because they have work experience in some companies. Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as the Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of the computer all day and play games.

In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very well known , it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction than everybody else does. Take for example the case of  the'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called the successful person even though he is not present, just because he did something different and tried a new thing that is the reason Reliance is so popular today.

93,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, I think that a person has to take some risks to reach a new position: doing this, it has the possibility to reach a new level of wellness, that can be reached only by courageous people.

95,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Indeed , advertising is one of the best ways to reach people. But some advertisements seem the most time much better than they really are. In my opinion, i agree with this statement for these two reasons:the use of very good commercials and also the use of celebrities in the commercial. First of all , many advertisements have really good commercials which can convince people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity, many of those commercials which want to sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as they get this product they might looklike this person. For example the increase in the production of numerous medicines to lose weight in this country is a proof that it works but at the same time the USA is still one of the most important countries, which has a problem with weight. Secondly, there is a huge use of celebrities in the advertisements that gives a false image of what a product really is. For instance , the last campaign of Proactiv Solution which is supposed to help to relieve acne. Personally, i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress.","['Indeed , advertising is one of the best ways to reach people.

We live our lives to our fullest when we are young, leaving behind the worries and the intricacies of old age.

""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better than younger people. But I feel that a younger blood has a lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than an older individual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late at night and will finish the project no matter what comes in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world. The older people have minds that are worn out, by age , by time. Whereas a younger mind has a lot of ideas to offer. These are fresh brains, that have come right from college, filled with all sorts of new tools and the vigour to put those tools to action. And also there is no burden of a family to support. A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife, his children, his home. , this list can go endless.

97,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"During life there are different periods and ages which each of them improve wider differences. The point of view of each period depends on the life experience, the good or bad looks, and how we take the events. Because the needs are totally different among ages. When we were children.

98,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,I agree with the statement because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts. The first factor is age at this age as a student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are the first step for a student. At this age students can easily grasp the point of concepts. for example take a student in the 7th standard in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him to learn the concepts then facts. Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts. Any student who is getting older can learn from his past about the facts. For example consider a 10th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world. So it is better for him to concentrate on his studies then to know about the facts. Third is it's the time for students to improve their skills in their studies because if they improve their skills in it then they automatically learn about the facts in it. For example consider a student who is studying for the 12th standard he learns from his past life the facts in it. as he growsup he knows more about the facts so it is better for students to concentrate on understanding the ideas and the concepts. Fourth at the student's age knowing about the facts can cause problems.

100,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In this essay I will shed light on the statement, that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. It is important, that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding, but mainly these dates and names can be researched in a book, or on the internet at almost any time. Although, some very important key facts must be memorized. When I was in a conversation with an American visitor in Genova, standing in front of the Columbus museum, I could not remember, when America was discovered. A such an important date is known by any second grade child However, I could not remember the year. He reminded me, that America was discovered in 1492. I felt very bad at that time that I would never forget this important fact in my life. However, I am convinced, that ideas and concepts are much more important than learning facts. Concepts are more likely to be necessary in daily life, than are facts. What I mean is, if there were two or more countries combating each other, it would be war. From school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times, that in all wars many people were killed, and in most of those lands and people changed nationality once the war was over. During the war many people were killed and tortured.","['In this essay I will shed light on the statement, that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

I think young people enjoy life more than older people. There are three reasons. First, young people have healthier bodies than older people do. Second, they have a longer time in the rest of their lives than older people do. Third, older people tend to say that the younger the better. First of all, young people have a healthier and stronger body than older people do. They can continue to work longer, run faster, need shorter time to sleep, and so on than old people do. That means young people can enjoy what old people can not do. For example, they can swim in the morning, go out for lunch, go shopping, and have a party with their friends. Second, they have a longer time remaining in their lives than old people do. If you want to be a very good and famous doctor, it will take about ten years to attend medical school and get enough experience as a doctor. Young people can plan and achieve this aim because they have time. However, old people may not be because they only have limited time in the rest of their lives. Finally, I often hear old people say that the younger the better. I am still young and can only imagine the lives of old people.","['We all hope that we want to enjoy our lives.

108,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Helping our community is very important. Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities, but it's not very often. I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time on their communities is the school rules. In high school and college they have a kind of rule -like homework- that a student has to help his or her community at list 10 hoursper year. We might think that school has this kind of rule to teach the importance of helping the community, but the truth is they have this rule because it's hard to see young people giving time to their communities. Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to. The second reason is that commissars are in need of helpers. They have a lot of things to do so they need many people. Most communities do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people.","[""Helping our community is very important.

They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate. I reason when people hear about a product they should research on the internet or something like that. It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give your credit card number already. Maybe they can get more than money. I think most of the advertisement lies because my mother always says this one, ""if your merchants are good you do not have to call somebody to come around you and take my product. If you are good already all the people who take your product you do not have to sell yourself as much as possible"".

125,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"In our western society, where the individual plays a central role, the community appears to be less and less important, although There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact it is what a great majority of people tend to believe. This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the media which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values. For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities. This widespread view needs to be confronted with reality and facts. I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplish anymore. Indeed a lot of associations exist. Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community. External factors explain that.

The main purpose of selling a product for the company is to show another thing better than what you sell. I do not agree with this idea because they're not showing what the product really is. A good idea is to show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product, and this will make the people interested. An important part to do sell, first of all you have to know on which market you're getting in. It's hard to get into the market you want sometimes, but having the type of market makes the promotion easier, because you can do the marketing regarding that market. There is a background behind a product, and belonging to a company. The product that is already on sale has an enormous study before getting to the store. Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time they pass through, by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about. The best way to sell could be by improving your product just by very tiny changes like making the product wantable, but not changing the product, just making people interested, curious and this will make people buy the product, this is a great way of doing a sell.","[""Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

In that case we might not be able to get a chance to stay in a nice hotel for a cheap price and have no season discount on flightseither. For example, one of my friends went to Germany from Korea for a flight that cost more than $ 1000 through the travel company, but I went to the same country the following week, less than $ 850 to get a season discount on my own. One more thing is that guides always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itinerary. In that case you won't get a chance to visit some nice place that only a few people know. I once had a chance to stay in a nice old castle in France. Most of my friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after seeing the picture I took.

However, I basically disagree with the position that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. I have two reasons for my claim. It prevents people from enjoying their personal privacy and enables them to visit only limited places. Most of all, peoplehardly like to enjoy their privacy once they have had a trip by joining a group. As a matter of fact, participating in a package travel needs people to organize it altogether and it is always necessary to have cooperation with strangers. Besides, people are even required to eat their meals at the same places and at the same time. Thus, there is no private time available to enjoy themselves such as walking on the beaches and having some relaxation when they wish to. As a result, traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite disappointed. In addition, it is hard to travel around some places where they want to. Generally, the trip's schedule has already been planned by a tour guide which makes it difficult for people to visit their own desirable places where they always dreamt about. In contrast, by travelling around some countries alone, it will allow people to walk around places and take some photographs and enjoy their holidays. Accordingly, going on a trip individually will be beneficial for people to access diverse places. To sum up, everyone has different opinions on this issue.","[""Whether to travel by forming a group or individually has been controversial among many people.

135,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I completely agree with this statement. The main reason for advertising is to sell their product on the market. They want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product. Advertisements should not only emphasize the goodness of their product, furthermore they stress a character given by the advertisement. For example, when there is a company advertising entertaining things like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisement during the commercial breaks. It is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisement is correct or not, the only important thing is that they get the people's attention and may achieve interest in watching their show. The only thing advertising does is because of money. Money rules the world. And so the company is not afraid to deceive people. Next to the obvious reason that the company wants people to buy their products first of all, is that maybe their product is not so good that people would buy it. In turn, they have to improve the image or quality of their product. This makes a product seem better although it might be worse. On the other hand lots of people have already had a lot of experiences with some advertisements and their promises years ago. Moreover, they got to know that most of the advertising is much better than the product in reality. This experience made people more sceptical. But how should people know if the advertised product is worse than the advertisement promised or if it is maybe exactly like that or even better? They have to test it. And therefore they spend some money.","[""I completely agree with this statement. The main reason for advertising is to sell their product on the market.

For instance, if I want to be a competitive person sending cars, I need to have many ideas in order to create new models and new types, more strongs, more sures, cheaper and nicer. I have to try many risks during the elaboration of these cars, I have to risk a lot of money on employers that they be more prepared and I must give them all the necessary resources that the government's law requires. If I want to be an altruist, I need to take risks even though I get scared. One person who does not like to be altruistic and success does not try any thing because he or she is scared and always they will be people comfortables and aphatics.","[""I think that those people that try new things and take risks have more success than those that only do what they already know how to do well.

141,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the given statement because i think it depends on the individual and not on the time available. A person who really wants to help his community can surely take time for the same whereas a person who is not that interested will use his time for other purposes rather than serving his community. No doubt, in the present generation the competition has increased and inorder to lead a really good life people really need to work hard. So in running after making a penny people overlook the need to spare time for working for the community. But still its not true that people dont give enough timefor thecommunity. For example, recently mumbai encountered a bomblast where thousands of people were injured. Then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospitals and getting their treatment done. A group of students took shifts for the whole night and served the injured with bread and tea. I think this shows the concern left in people. Donating money for the development of poor people is also one way of serving the community. Because of the vast destruction of tsunami many people were left with starving stomachs.","['I disagree with the given statement because i think it depends on the individual and not on the time available.

144,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place. Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there. They may lose their way, and be in trouble with the particular language and culture. For example, American children who go to Singapore receive a heavy punishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place. If a tourist was along with them and taught them Singapore's rules, they wouldn't be in trouble there.","['As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide.

We will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future. On the one hand, petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable, for instance because they are in big cities. Moreover, governments are developing tubes, trains or buses to encourage people not to use their own car and to pollute less. For example, lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown on the tube in Paris. On the other hand, the population of Third-World countries is growing, and at the same time, lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering getting a car. Furthermore, lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent. For this reason, it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them up just every hour. Besides, scientists are considering developing cars with hybrid motors, which rely both on electricity and oil. It could be a very good solution to the cost of oil. For the moment, those cars are purchased above all in Japan but they may soon be sold all over the world. To put it in a nutshell, the issue of cars is rather an issue of oil supply.

Let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by globalization, we will agree that people will be more fortunate than they have ever been. The increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemed to be luxury before, including cars. Take China as an example, more and more families boast cars now, which was a miracle to them before. If we pay some attention to the soaring earnings of people in Africa today, we all agree that the conclusion is that they tend to buy more cars just like what the Chinese are doing today.

Besides that, they also increase the independence and freedom of people, who will not be restricted by location and weather.

Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as a specialized course during college as it is expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perform during his job. Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an opportunity /liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and make a career.

156,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Some people agree that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts or others disagree that. When I read this question, I was conflicted between agreeing or disagreeing because both are important to students. However, I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are a few specific reasons and examples to support my statement. First, ideas and concepts could be basic information of all theory or other  information. For example, facts are from the ideas and concepts. If there are not ideas and concepts, there also are not facts, all investigations have patterns or methods such a scientific method. First of all we think of ideas and concepts first. That is why I assert that all facts are made by lots of ideas and concepts. Second, People can nat critical thinking when they learn facts. For example, 1+1=2 is absolutely a fact but they would not know why 1+2=2 because they do not know the concept of the concept. Students to understand are ideas and concepts that will be helpful to them.","['Some people agree that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts or others disagree that.

157,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"As people grow older their interests may change. Whether young or old, each generation has their own amusement. However I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons. First of all, generally speaking, young people are less careful of their health than old people are. As people grow older the possibility that they will become sick willincrease. In hospital there are too many older people who consult a doctor for many reasons. As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the dearest thing of all. Secondly, young people do not have their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan for the future easily. Old people can not ever change their job or their partner in marriage. It makes the life of old people boring and less exciting. In addition to that old people have a heavy responsibility for their job and their family. In contrast, young people have a lot of time in the future; they can draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream. Finally young people, particularly young women can enjoy fashion and cosmetics. In the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women. This means that young people tend to enjoy a fashionable life and fashion brands target not old women but young women. Young women can spend more money than old women do because young women can use their money freely. And as people get older they get their weight more easily than they were young and they can not wear clothes that fit them when they were young. Young people enjoy their life too.","['As people grow older their interests may change. Whether young or old, each generation has their own amusement.

158,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Although some people may think that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are, I totally agree that it helps the product to be sold out in the market with the result of the consumers' curiosity, if it is an advertisement made of/for women and if the advertisement is colourful enough. First of all, advertisements increase the curiosity of people especially if it is for women. Assume that a woman is watching the TV, who loves chocolate and sees the commercial on the television which has the mother seeing her son and her husband as a bar of chocolate and wanting to get a bite of them, the woman watching the commercial will be curious about the product and will give it a try. It is obvious that she won't be the only one so this will give a chance for that product to take place on the market shelf. It will be the consumers' decision to keep it there or ignore it on the next visit. The second thing is that women are the best customers in the world. It may not be the man who would like to give it a try if he sees the product right after he sees the advertisement but a woman can keep it in mind in the shopping list and that list appears when it comes to shopping and she picks up the product and gives it a try. For example, if it is a man who is in the market to get a pack of coffee he most likely picks up the package of coffee he is used to but if it is a woman she gets her regular coffee with the one she saw on the board on her way to the mall. The third one is colourful and well prepared advertisements. A car you would never ask for may look like a Ferrari to you in a well prepared commercial and you may go ahead and see it in the store.","[""Although some people may think that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are, I totally agree that it helps the product to be sold out in the market with the result of the consumers' curiosity, if it is an advertisement made of/for women and if the advertisement is colourful enough.

The man has millions of dollars, he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertising. I strongly believe that most advertisements make products better than they really are. First, the main factor that the advertisement is good is that it shows a low price to attract the audience. Alot of businessmen try to attrack the audience. For example, they try to give the lowest price with anew package. I remember one man. He works for a small company. he was a very hard worker. He tried to buy his cat. But he can not get any good money from it. One man suggested to him to make an advertisement. Now he bought his cat for ahigh price. So advertisers can attract people by using low prices. Second, the main issue of making an advertisement is that it can give agood background about the products. My father is a business man. One day he solidified his materials for free, I asked him why?. He told me that if you have agood background you just need water to live a life. So agood background about some thing, it can make you feel good. Third, the last factor that the advertisement makes the product seem much better is to be popular around the world. As one man, if you have agood advertisement about your product, you will have agood idea around the world. Beacuse T. V can show your advertisements to be good.

161,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like. Because waves are not seen by people, they do not have the color, smell and sound.

Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation.

Once you have received the job you can still and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for. Secondly, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas.

170,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play. Young people are physically healthier and have more energy than older people. People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things. Experiencing convenient and fun things leads to people enjoying their life. For example, when people travel by car, young people may use a navigator in the car which helps them to travel far easily. They can find the location they want to see simply. However, old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators. Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people.","['I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play.

It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius. To sum up, the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things. But its maybe the most important thing to realise that all human beings are different. As we all have different abilities and unabilities. The real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being taught.

Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like.

First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation.

Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car.

186,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact. In my opinion many times ads. fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads. have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view. First of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in the ads. as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands. Another point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example the sports shoes never last me so long as I expected from the ads. I see and the price I paid for them. Moreover another issue is customer service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads. Most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately most of the time you can not get a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in useless conversations. Another trick used by ads. is the way those ads work. are shown. Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you would rather pay attention to the person or musician announcing the item than the announced item itself. Linked to this is when famous people as actors, actresses, film makers, sportsmen or sportwomen are used in the ads.","['I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements (ads. )make products seem much better than they are in fact.

While people are enjoying their obvious advantages, problems come accompanied with the convenience they bring. More and more people are complaining about the air pollution that cars create.

On the contrary, the development of cars will be surprising and momentous. Twenty years can be a long time or a short time, but the development of the quality of cars, including speed, security would be tremendously huge.

203,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Generally, people doing what they already know how to do will not work hard on their things. However, people trying new things and taking risks may achieve success easily. In the risk and trying new things, they might have an advantage in opportunity and knowledge. Trying new things means having more opportunities, because you can find more access to accomplish the thing that you try. Once you begin with one subject ,you will be surprised at what it looks like and try to find out more about it. For example, you are having a toefl test. In this test , you don't know what the test looks like ,because you didn't take the test before. Hence, you will meet lots of difficulties in this test which you didn't predict ahead of time. And several good opportunities are given , and you have to overcome them one by one. Since that, you will know what you will do next time. That can be helpful for being successful. Secondly, knowledge can be an aid to anyone who can help you to be successful. But first of all, how can we get knowledge? The answer is simple, taking risks.","[""i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

204,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Personally, i think that it is very important for students to learn ideas and concepts. Some people think the opposite, they think that it is better and useful to learn facts, they are against theory, but without theory, it is more difficult to learn facts. Learning some concepts or ideas is necessary, it is the basis to achieve good results. For example at university: if students don't study some essential concepts in some subjects, they don't understand the gist of that subject and the study should become a waste of time.

205,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with the statement. To me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies, so the entire population depends on advertisements which show ""incredible products"" which can resolve many different problems, such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain, or how to repair a part of the furniture; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program. In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and wastes a lot ofmoney. For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one).

206,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is important or learning the facts. Because every thing in our life ca not be understood through the ideas and concepts that need more creative minds. firstly when we talk about ideas and concepts these are sometimes easy to understand but some times very typical to understand. And this also depends on the type of mind that the student has. and understanding ideas and concepts also depends on the way we have brought in our life. because if a student is restricted to certain things in his childhood then he ca not have a creative mind. and if everything is understood through ideas then there will be a more number of scientists than normal people on the earth. And the other thing we have to talk about is learning facts that is learning throughexperiences. and everything we cant experience because if we think wearing a helmet can be implemented after facing any problem then its just like taking a chance in our life. and every thin cant be learned through facts because every thing cant be a fact in our life. because it is difficult to get every thing as a fact. and if we wait for a fact to happen in our life then our life will be completed just for learning and not for implementing those which we have learned. And the important thing is understanding ideas and concepts gives the sharpness to our minds as we go on understanding them but there are some concepts which ca not be understood through ideas but we can understand them through the facts, thus there is a need for facts. and learning things through the facts is a good thing which improves our practical knowledge. but every thing ca not be a fact so it is good to learn them from the ideas and concepts. and the reproduction of plants and animals can be well understood through the facts.","['I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is important or learning the facts.

207,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Good marketing strategies and a lot of psychology are placed in advertisements. They want to make customers think they buy the best product on earth, but sometimes the companies are cheating. In my opinion it's true, that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The big bosses of the economy want to make big money by selling a lot of their products. To reach their thoughts, they would nearly do everything they could do. There are many reasons why managers try to reach much more money. One example is the stock market, which opens many people up to the possibility of being a shareholder of a company. They invest their money with the thought of getting more money back in the future and so they put the manager under great pressure, because he's the man who has the investments of the shareholder in his hands. I think that many managers don't want to be unemployed and so they start to find the best ways of selling. Some make their products without good quality, so that the customers need a new one after using them a few times. The disappointment of this is, that the products are presented as unbreakable wonders which can change the world. This strategy gets a lot of money for the company, but only for the first time, because the customers are not stupid and after buying one or two times this product they won't come back to the company with such a bad quality. So if the company wants to have success it has to improve the products, but they only do small changes and sell them the same strategy thez did the first time. In my opinion a lot of companies do it that way and that makes it very difficult to separate the good products from the bad ones. The customers have to test the products even more clearly.","[""Good marketing strategies and a lot of psychology are placed in advertisements.

240,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","Any other expression would not be more important than this topic. Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same. I believe, traffic is not just a waste of time; in addition, it is a waste of energy. For instance, from school to home normally-with traffic-it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes; but, when the roads are empty it takes nearly 1 hour. It means that everyday I spend 1 hour on theroads.","['Any other expression would not be more important than this topic. Petroleum, which is used in many countries to fight with each other, is decreasing in quantity. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today, and I am sure that there will be another way of transportation different from cars. There are several reasons why I believe that, fewer cars will be used in the future. In my opinion, the main problem is the energy problem; the world is growing every day, the requirements of the new energy sources are in need of more than ever. Today the main energy source for transportation is petroleum; however it is clear that the deposits of it are decreasing in quantity. The other energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power, fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen-and geothermal sources are not sufficient to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector. For instance, the most ultimately designed solar car, which can reach a speed of 90km/h, can only carry 2 people, and is 3 meters long, due to the need of large solar panels. In addition, cars, which operate with fuel cells are not suitable to use on the highways; maybe they can be used at low speeds in the city. Another important aspect is traffic problems, I think. Big cities are growing everyday, and more and more cars are sold in these cities. However, the roads stay the same.

242,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts. There have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen progress. There could have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels. I always liked science which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics call I will use the concepts and ideas to get to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts there will be times when they will not help get the solution. In our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very basic example, If my parents want me to go buy vegetables from the vegetable market I will decide which way will be the easier road. I will answer by asking myself using my concepts and not going with the facts.","['I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts better than spending time learning facts.

258,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,I totally disagree with this statement. So many young guys today are helping other people to manage their life. I live in a small city called Erding and also in such a small city a club to help students to get better marks established. I joined this club one year ago and at first I was surprised how many young people were offering their help there. All of these people are graduate students who use their free time after being in their courses and classes to spend it teaching other students. A major fact is that the other guys and I do not earn a lot of money by this activity. Since my first visit to the club I have been doing private lessons once a week.

It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts. Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying.","['From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life.

If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company.

He can make more effort to learn those things. Because he has to enter that field to work. then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts.

266,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I completely agree with the statement that ' successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. In today's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very well known , it is somebody who has done something different from the others. There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else. Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction than everybody else does. Take for example the case of  the'Dhiubhai Ambani' who is today being called the successful person even though he is not present, just because he did something different and tried a new thing that is the reason Reliance is so popular today. The new care taker of the Reliance company is the son of its founder, so we cannot call them equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his business. What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the business with not much money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established business. Taking risks is another part of success as it is a well saying ' more the risk involved, more the chances of success'. As one can also see, a good thing always involves a high amount of risk. To achieve good things one has to go through a series of risks involved, according to another saying ' to get the rose you have to suffer the pain of being hurt', and to achieve success the risk has to be taken no matter how painful it can be. Risks are involved in every new thing or you can say that risk is an internal part of every success one wants to achieve. If nobody had been ready to take risks there would not have been any new inventions. To be successful in life one has to go through one or some other kind of risk. Otherwise success would have been very easy without risk and every person would have been successful or you could say that every person would have been at the same level. Success involves risks. Suppose during the British rule over India if every person especially our freedom fighters, had not come forward considering the risks involved and would have lived the way the rulers wanted them to then would we have ever got independence? Ofcourse not, thats why to become successful and get the independence they had to take the risk of their lives.

When I was a kid, I went sightseeing with my parents, relatives, and tour guide. It was the worst experience which I have ever had. Here are several reasons why traveling guided by a guide is so bad. To begin with, traveling with a guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start. It cannot give you free time. Not only that, but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends. I think that one of the purposes of having a tour is to relax without a busy life. If you go with a guide, you will not get any fresh air. Second, traveling in a group makes people angry. It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested in, others have a desire to move to other places because they do not need to observe anymore. In this case, they have to decide what they will do. But any group in this situation would be disappointed. Finally, there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone, you are not alone. It means that going on a trip alone allows you to make friends. For instance, I went to Japan when I was a freshman at university.","['I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with a tour guide.

First of all, cars are really convenient for people to travel,especially when the trip is short. It can drive from one place to another quickly. For example, in the cities we live in, we have to work, study or see friends everyday. If one has a car, it can save him a lot of time everyday. No need to stand in a line for the bus and being in a hurry to catch the underground in order not to be late. Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above. For this reason, more and more people will buy cars on their own. Secondly, it is necessary for a family to own a car. A case to prove the point is an example of mine. We have a car of our own. So when we want to go out for a trip, we can drive there ourselves. It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow. Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there was no transportation to there in the past. So with the demands of the families, there will be more cars on the roads in the future. More and more families would like to have cars at that time. Lastly, we can find out that it is more and more busy on the ways now that before.","['With technology developing so fast today, we have to say that science and technology have changed our world a lot.

275,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with the author's statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"". It is said that "" God will help them those who help themselves "" , it is implied that they take the risk and try out new things which may lead to great success. For example if Edison had not tried for a new thin he would not have invented the electric bulb. If Newton had eaten the apple, he would not have known the law of gravity. Always it is better to take calculated risks when ever required which helps us to flourish in life. When risk is taken the reward is sure some day. It is suggested that you try a new thing ,experiment which leads to development and growth in the field you are interested in. Aim for stars atleast you can seeeach moon. A good example for successful people is Gandhi, the father of the nation of india ,he tried a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took as much risk as he could , Finally he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land. Thats why the risk is always rewarded which is for a good cause for the maximum benefitof mankind.","['I agree with the author\'s statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well"".

277,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons. First, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. For example, in 1995 when I was junior at Tokyo University in Tokyo Japan, I studied law and tax. One day, when my friends and I were researching bank law, I was confused by the law. One of my friends, Tanaka, is the best student studying economics and has a lot of knowledge of the bank system. He helped me. I was able to learn a lot of things about bank law. As the example shows, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more convenient. Second, having a variety of academic subjects is more fun. For example, in 1996 when I worked part-time at a private school, I taught Japanese History. I taught Japanese History ,Law and Tax in the historical class. Children in my class were interested in social systems. They asked me a lot of questions about history, law and tax. Some children wanted to study law. I had a good time at my lecture. This experience clearly shows that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes me fun and brings me a good time.","['I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons.

So many older people don't want to try new things such as education, travelling, and culture, etc. But young people are different. They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things. I usually get happiness from learning. In my opinion, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people. As time goes by, the number of entertainment increases. In the past, people worked for a living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of their lives. Young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than older people do. For example, my father is a very hard-worker and he doesn't have free time for himself.

293,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I am agrre with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. Successful people always think about new things. Because that is their confident behaviour to achieve their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think about how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they are already doing their present job well. The people who are already successful in their field are able to take any risks for new things. Successful people try new things because they know all the secrets to reaching the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occurring with new things. They try and they can easily do new things. For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming software like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB. NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks with those courses. He attended coaching to learn those skills at the time after completion of his work in his present job. He can make more effort to learn those things.

294,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Many people will have different ways of responding to this question. but most would say yes it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts. Understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life, once students understand concepts and ideas facts will come to them and, students will know what they are talking about later on. First of all, understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will naturally come to them. for example, in business, if the students boss tells them to go do this this and this the student will immediately understand the idea and once he has understood the idea he will naturally understand the concept in order to do something. Second, once the student understands the idea and concept behind something the facts will automatically come to him. for instance, once the student understands an idea he understands a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand facts because because all facts have an idea and a concept behind them. moreover, it would be hard for the student just to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life has concepts and ideas even facts. Finally, the student will know what he/she is talking about later on. say for example a student is trying to impress someone and she only knows facts she will say all the facts but will not understand what she is saying or even what isgoing on. however, beforehand if this student were to know here concepts and ideas she could easily know what she/he is talking about later on when she gives a speech or wants to impress someone.","['Many people will have different ways of responding to this question. but most would say yes it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts.

295,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I disagree with this, because it's also a sort of lying to their customers. I understand that they are trying to sell their products alot, but they have to think about their customers to not be disappointed. I really enjoy watching TV, and there are lots of advertisements during the show break. Watching those advertisements makes me laugh, because I know that things will never happen. A few years ago, I saw an advertisement for a hair shampoo on TV, so I decided to try that because I thought my hair would be like the models on TV. I bought that shampoo, and tried it. On the first day, I did not see any difference, so I thought it took a while to be silky. I waited. Nothing happened. That shampoo was the same as the other products. Not one thing was different or special except the nice smell. I've been using it for a few years now, but still, nothing seems to happen. They are really trying hard to grab people's attention, but advertising to trick people is not good.

However, some of them may have two majors. Which idea is good? In this essay, there are several reasons why I do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. First of all, everyone has got the same time. In other words, the condition to have an amount of study may be the same for everyone. If you spend all your time on a specific subject, you can improve a lot rather than the person who spends his or her time on two subjects. This is because he or she should divide the time. Let us assume that there are two students and the same time is offered: A person who only does economics and B person who does economics and politics. Compared with A person, B person would know more about politics. However, A person would know more about economics than a B person. Secondly, in the sense that broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be useful for normal lives.","['Nowadays, the more the students are educated, the deeper knowledge they will have on their subject.

298,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or ideas about where and how to use them in practice. For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept. For every problem there will be a concept behind solving it. Another example, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that there is a chapter called ""GRAVITATION"". In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation.","['I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

To put it this way, say that you want to learn something in biology in plants, animals, fish, reptiles, insects and mammels. To know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book, you can read through the main facts and details that were given to you.

Also, another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened example, who killed someone or who is the one responsible for committinga crime. To find out,you need to ask yourselves: ""How did he or she die and who killed them? ""The questions will be answered if you give in every piece of information you have gathered when you want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people.

Students have learnt facts by themselves that they would have a deep expression of what they have done. if we just let the students understand ideas and concepts,they might not really learn facts.

Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things. Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrast, some think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well. I actually agree with the first idea. these are my following reasons Firstly,success is related toresponsibility. When successful people try new things and take risks they trust their responsible characteristics. For example i know a professor who is so successful at his job. Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to them. In addition to this he never leaves his jobs because ofluck. He usually plans his works and lives for them. Actually this feature brings success to him In addition to this,success is reletead withexperience. If a person has experiences in life or business or human psychology he/she can achieve success very easily. Also these experiences help the person to try new things and take risks in a comfortable way. Plus the person can feel relief depending on the experiences. for instance i have a friend who is so willing to travel and see the world. Moreover she has many kinds of experiences all over the world. Basically these experiences help her in her job to be more successful. She is not afraid of trying new things thanks to her experiences.

315,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"First of all I want to say, what the question deals with. I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides. In my opinion it would be better if you had broad knowledge of many subjects. The reason why this is in my opinion will be written down in the following text. First i want to say, that if you have broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies. So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic studies. Maybe the company you want to be hired by is searching for a person who knows things about every part of a firm. A reason could be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone. Then they can hire you for a job but if a person from another work is missed,you are able to do his work too. Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than to specialize in one part. You should know everything about this part. I want to give an example. If you want to specialize in marketing,you have to know everything about it. You can only be hired in this part of a firm. And if you are not needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked. But if you have knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm. A third advantage of broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things. you can learn new things in all parts of academic life. It would be boring if you did the same things the whole of your life. A broad knowledge gives you the possibility that you can change your work. Your life would be more exciting.

346,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I can see both advantages and disadvantages to trying new things and taking risks to be successful. You can choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risks to be successful. I definitely believe that people should try new things and take risks to be successful. If you do everything with a routine that means you know the results. For example if a farmer uses traditional methods for agriculture, he can guess how much crops he will get. He can avoid risks by doing that. But it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he willn't be successful. He will get the same amount of crop as next year. The point I am trying to make is, that it is not a desirable way to be a successful person. On the other hand he could try different ways in order to get a lot of crops which means taking risksfor success. In my opinion, successful people try new things and take risks. For instance, if the farmer tries a new way which he has not experienced before he can get a different amount of crops. he could get whether '' less or much'' but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk. I already know that lots of successful people in the business area try new things and figure out new ways. That is the main reason for their success. For instance a very well known newspaper owner was just a writer in a newspaper.","[""I can see both advantages and disadvantages to trying new things and taking risks to be successful.

347,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products. If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone.

The choice, nevertheless, is not easy to make. However, from my point of view, I would like to believe the latter one is more reasonable. Because there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now, my arguments are listed as follows. An essential reason that can be seen by everyone is that the gas released from cars in big cities pollutes the environment around us seriously. According to a recent survey announced by the Minister of Health of China, cars' gas pollution accounts for 38. 7% of the total pollution which harms our environment. This strongly demonstrates that car pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be fewer cars used in our lives. Another reason for my inclination is that the number of cars makes the cities become overcrowded and It is very inconvenient for people to go to study , work and so on. For instance, in a big city, It usually takes one person to live on the outskirts one or even two hours to arrive at the company he/she works for in the center of the city.

355,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Although broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting, I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons.

Moreover, specialization is very important when you are a job seeker, particularly when you are looking for your first job. There is not any chance for people to know many things from a superficial view; it is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field. I can concide that broad knowledge is useful sometimes, for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff. But that is not usually the common case because most people work in medium or large companies. Thus, the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself.

Some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude. However, in my part, I prefer to make my trip alone rather than in a group as my inclination. Among countless reasons , there are two conspicuous aspects as follows. The main reason why I disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange. If you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guides lead you to and have no free time to communicate with the local people. IN contrast, travelling alone you get access to the local people' s life and culture. Through talking and living with them, you can have different cultures and perspectives on life. That will only present you with a new culture or tradition of life, also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world. there is another reason deserving some words here. Travelling in a group led by a tutor is a waste of money in some conditions. Because the guide depends on the money you spend on the trip to survive. They usually convince the traveller things that have no value become necessities and buy them. In contrast , if a person travels along a person can use a computer to get information about an unknown place.

361,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life. It is much more important for a person or a student in this situation to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. To learn facts you have to understand the concepts and the idea of what you are learning. Therefore as an example: a person can learn a fact from a book about world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginning. Every person has brains therefore , it should be used. Logic and common sense are all matters for understanding ideas and concepts. A person can memorize a book but that does not mean that the person understood it. People should use their brains to understand things. For example: Newton's laws of motion, ""for every action there is a reaction"". A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts, but a person can use his brain and a little bit of common sense and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts. However learning facts is important for a person to do, but not as important as understanding the ideas and learning the concepts. Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper, he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying. while a person can teach something if he does nt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough.","['From what I learned, knew and heard and told throughout this life.

373,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are very convenient. We can simply stay in our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seem better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailers let them consider buying the products. In my opinion, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailers' sales. First, we have a lot of ways to get information, such as the internet, or TV shows. Since these are the immediate environment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, because of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, it is less likely to be estimated accurately.

I have experience that the test I bought seems intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at a bookstore, I would not have this kind of problem. Second, there are many well developed ways to sell products. They know what the customers want. They like to buy a nice product for an inexpensive price. It can be less expensive than a reasonable price. The retailer uses discounts or limiting the number of selling products and tries to attract customers' attention. At this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonable or not rather than whether it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distorts the customers' attention toward price. To conclude, because of inaccurate estimations and damaging by the price of products, we seem to buy products which are actually not as good as they expected. Therefore, we should be aware of what we want, and what we need. We should think twice that advertisements are not as good as we think.","[""I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

When I was a child many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays, those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands.

Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or months you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting. Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You should not be concerned about whether you have enough money either if you have a job or not. It does not matter to you.

Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or months you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting. Here are some examples of why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You should not be concerned about whether you have enough money either if you have a job or not. It does not matter to you. On the other hand it really depends on how people have planned theirlives.', 'The most grown up people I know, have a house or an apartment somewhere, children and a job.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"

379,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"In the context of constant competition between products and trademarks, what makes them different ? Is it the product, the advertising or the trademark ? We'll see that ""false"" advertising is necessary for a company and is controlled by the rules of competition. Finally, we'll see that advertising isn't the product underneath but much more an identifying suggestion for customers. First, a company that launches a product cannot possibly find a large scale of customers without promoting it. Therefore, a company needs advertisements to exist or to continue existing. With the laws of competitions, the advertising is in a way self-controlled. As we saw last week with ""L'Oreal"", a company cannot say anything in an advertisement. They have to be able to prove their assertions in an advertising campaign otherwise other companies will sue them for a lack of accuracy that damages the market competition. Second, companies usually ""lie"" about their product because they won't tell you immediately the side effects or problems you might encounter with the use of the product. Advertising will sell you the good effects of the products. But, I do not think the real matter is the product underneath. I mean more and more advertising does not sell you a product directly but an underground, an atmosphere or a celebrity. In a way, advertisements are here to help you identify a trademark, the one you want to look like or lifestyle you want. And, an advertising campaign is more like a dream maker, suggesting that you need the product if you want to achieve a certain lifestyle or look like a celebrity but it didn't tell you that you will achieve it.

The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player, for example, is not as varied as it was written on the box.

397,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes for most people. When you decide to have a holiday, should you join in with a group led by a tour guide or travel alone? In my opinion, both of them have merits. Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself. The guide will arrange everything for you, all you should do is just follow his/her guide. In addition, the members of the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others, which will make the tour more interesting and fun. Furthermore, travelling with a group can save you some money. For example, you can share a hotel with your groupmember. However, in other circumstances, travelling alone may be more suitable for you. Firstly, travelling alone can give you more flexibility. You do not have to follow the strict schedule made by the tour guide. Secondly, if you do not want to be interrupted by others, travelling alone may be a better choice. In addition, if you tend to go to a place, that is not attractive to others, travelling alone may be the only choice for you. Also, you can have more privacy by travelling alone. As to me, my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it. Suppose, I plan to visit a historical place, which is relevant to my subject, and even most people do not know it, I may have to go there alone. On the contrary, if my destination is Yellow Stone park, I would like to join a group, so I can communicate with other members. In addition, money is another factor, which can affect my decision.

421,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing. Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives.","[""It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age.

Their criticism merely demonstrates their inability to take responsibility or to adapt to recent events, which would bring about a difference in mentality in the next generation.

When the claim something is high technology,maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed! But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life? Certainly not.

430,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics. Despite that thought, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts. One of the reasons for students to clearly understand ideas and concepts is motivation. If students understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated. For example, in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done. later on, they will be able to understand the importance of eating healthily. Even more they will encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food. The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eating healthily. Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is that it is easier to learn when people understand concepts. I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works. First he gave me an example of how a water system works. Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system. At that time I was able to learn how the heart works. Finally understanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity.","[""Nowadays students don't want to make too much effort learning topics.

431,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some say it does not. In my opinion, however, young people enjoy life rather than older people do because, they are impulsive, energetic, and creative. Firstly, it is generally accepted that young people are more impulsive than old people. Therefore, young people usually do things without certain plans. For example, in my personal experience, I have been on a trip without any plans with my friends. One day, one of my friends suddenly suggested going on a trip and we just agreed to go on a trip that day, because we were young and impulsive. Secondly, it is normally accepted that young people are more energetic than old people. In fact, it is hard to enjoy life such as going on a trip or going on a picnic for old people because they are less energetic. However, young people are always energetic in general. Therefore, it can be described as one reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Lastly, it seems clear that young people are more creative than old people. They always bring something new and creative and move into action. It is one of the ways that they enjoy their life creatively. Moreover, in my personal experience, one day, I and my friend were thinking about making fake IDs. Therefore, we moved into action and tried it. Unfortunately or Fortunately, we were charged by a police officer lightly, however, it exists as a still interesting memory for me.","['Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

Does it mean that becoming an adult, dissipates happiness and good times? According to my own experience , i think that people were getting happier when they were children. They just live how their mind guides them through without thinking about consequences. Firstly ,I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything material. They live their life without thinking about the consequences. Indeed, everything they wanted to do is possible, so they just have to realise what their hearts tell them to do. People are used to saying that mankind is led by money and interest,contrary to children who are only guided through life by happiness and pleasure.

What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil.

Giving enough time to helping communities not only gives me peace, a lovely feeling but also gives me a wild view to see the world. Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becoming bigger and bigger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich people are afraid of being hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child a well-educated child. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities?

463,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students are of different types and the way of preparing for their subject and the way they approach the subject are different when compared to each other. Some people go around the concept and the ideas of the subject and what the main aim and the use of the subject are and they go in a different manner to get the subject. Some students just blindly take the text books,and not only text books and they collect a lot of material and they just go blindly reading those facts that are in the books and material,so in this case the students wont get the practical knowledge of the subject and just blindly know what the subject is. These people cant do the practical problems and they cant go deeper into the subject. It is also important that after getting the idea and the concept of the subject the student should go front reading the facts regarding the subject. That makes a lot of knowledge regarding the subject. I strongly agree with the statement""It is more important for students to understand the ideas and the concept of the subject than it is for them to learn facts"". Students who go in the manner of understanding the idea of the subject and the purpose of the subject and how the subject is inter related with the other topics will get a good idea of the subject. Unless the student gets the idea of what the subject is and what the concept behind writing all these tasks in a subject it is used less for the student to do a course. A student who goes along with the idea and the concept of the subject gains a lot of grip on the subject and he may produce any thing regarding the subject on demand. For example,let us take a student who is having a subject in C language on his/her course,the student who first goes through the text book and gets the idea of the language and what the subject is and what is needed for programming in a C language can write a technical program for a small application based on C language. On the other hand the student who goes through the facts of the subject will not get the practical idea and he cant produce an application in C language. How can he produce an application with out knowing what is the main idea of the subject and what is the concept that outputs an application in C language. Even the student who is having a course in Maths in his academic year,if he goes along with the facts that are related to the subject how can he solve a problem related to the subject of mathematics. On the other hand the students who get the complete idea ragrading the idea and the concept of the subject can automatically solve the problem given. The first task is that the student should know what the idea is and after that he can go through the facts of the book and he also requires learning knowledge regarding the subject. Finally,i conclude that the student should go for the preparation of a subject in a manner of getting the idea regarding the subject and the concept regarding the subject. Unless these two things the student ca not approach the practical way of the subject.","['Students are of different types and the way of preparing for their subject and the way they approach the subject are different when compared to each other. Some people go around the concept and the ideas of the subject and what the main aim and the use of the subject are and they go in a different manner to get the subject. Some students just blindly take the text books,and not only text books and they collect a lot of material and they just go blindly reading those facts that are in the books and material,so in this case the students wont get the practical knowledge of the subject and just blindly know what the subject is. These people cant do the practical problems and they cant go deeper into the subject. It is also important that after getting the idea and the concept of the subject the student should go front reading the facts regarding the subject. That makes a lot of knowledge regarding the subject. I strongly agree with the statement""It is more important for students to understand the ideas and the concept of the subject than it is for them to learn facts"". Students who go in the manner of understanding the idea of the subject and the purpose of the subject and how the subject is inter related with the other topics will get a good idea of the subject. Unless the student gets the idea of what the subject is and what the concept behind writing all these tasks in a subject it is used less for the student to do a course. A student who goes along with the idea and the concept of the subject gains a lot of grip on the subject and he may produce any thing regarding the subject on demand. For example,let us take a student who is having a subject in C language on his/her course,the student who first goes through the text book and gets the idea of the language and what the subject is and what is needed for programming in a C language can write a technical program for a small application based on C language. On the other hand the student who goes through the facts of the subject will not get the practical idea and he cant produce an application in C language. How can he produce an application with out knowing what is the main idea of the subject and what is the concept that outputs an application in C language.

Thus I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. First of all, I really want to know more about a subject which really interests me, namely the Economists.

482,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products.

But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us.

I support this statement by giving reasons and examples in the following paragraphs. firstly,students should understand ideas and concepts because it makes them understand clearly and accurately. Understanding ideas and concepts of a particular topic makes their work fast and perfectly. For example suppose a student wants to give a seminar on the topic of spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and thoroughly. So that he or she can generate more ways of elaborating on the topic which can be helpful during the seminar. Secondly,learning the concepts makes a person more perfect in the topic which he is working on. so that he can generate new ways and methods. for example during the preparation of an experiment the scientist should know the concept of the experiment so that he can work well and avoid risks and harmfuleffects. Buy understanding the concepts and ideas clearly and correctly one develops more knowledge and data regarding the topic rather than learning facts. Thirdly,facts are the material which has been developed already which can not be developed further. but understanding an idea and concepts we can further discover and invent new ideas from the ideas we have. for example using the water and its properties scientists have developed the steamengine. Famous scientists who had developed the concept of numbersystem were clearly understood by aryabatta.

All is studied to make it attractive, brilliant, colourful, nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful. It has occurred many times that the product was truly disappointing compared to the advertisement. Of course, it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as ""fabulous"" as they were supposed to be. I spent some money on various things, from CDs to a DVD player, beauty products for my sister or very diverse things, which happened to be smaller than they were said to be, less efficient or to break very easily. My brother, who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be. The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player, for example, is not as varied as it was written on the box. Apart from the high technology, I would tend to say that advertising does not lie so much about food products. Is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it? We can buy a television once within a couple of years, be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority, it is different from the food advertisements, or the items we regularly need to buy.","['I do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are.

The facts are learned and exist in our life from the past experience and intentions. But the question, that always occurs to us, how do we make an idea and how can the idea be a fact?

496,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my school days, we gave enough time to help my colleagues in Japan. Developing the economy, we decreased the relationship between the communites in Tokyo. So our school established new subjects which are so amazing. I want to explain the experience through this class. I attended the communication center in my home town after class. My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology. For instance, Japanese cellular phones can be used as railroad tickets, wallets and so on. But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them.

My friends and old people who are over 60 years old attended. My friends and I taught about IT products such as cellular and personal computers. Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular phones, old people do not use them in general. Modern life is sustained by Information Technology.

In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examination by building higher and better buildings. Also you keep the facts better in your mind.

Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea. Secondly, you are able to improve the concept.

The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger. Burger King advertisements are the most popular examples for the curious consumers to find out about their consumer rights. Last but not least, being the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the price of your product. For instance Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market. So they are able to change the price of their products, Ipod, freely. How did they become the main producer? With advertisements actually.

As time passes, transportation and different ways of transporting are being improved and while improving it is being cheaper. What improvements the transportation can see; subways, busses, railways with comfortable trains, planes, jet planes etc. Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper; because with supply and demand balances in the economy, the increased numbers in cars increases demand for fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is fossil energy.

516,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments. I believe most of these advertisements make products seem better because they only talk about good things about their products and they also use attractive things, such as people, to fascinate people. Since advertisements only show the benefits of that product, it seems very attractive to people. For example, my mother wanted to have a new vaccum. When she was watching the TV show, there was a commercial about a new vaccine. It said "" this is really powerful and useful! You should buy one! !""or that sort of thing.","['These days, the number of advertisements is increasing because of technological developments.

517,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First, I think they can succeed because they have already taken their risk, it is all risk out side the world, each thing has a risk but seems to big or small. For example, if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be an accident on you. Taking risks is a must. The mean of success is they know how to do things well, A human being has a tendency to learn more to find out new things. Of course, by the way people who are learning will have many problems to solve. Successful people know that if they don't find a new way or new thing to do, other people can catch up with them. They want to lead, so they have to seek, to seek what the world needs so they can do it. Although many people think successful people are selfish, just doing things they like or they want, they won't share with others, but I think it is only other people who don't understand what they are thinking.","[""In my opinion, I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. First of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that things that have been done by successful people take a long time to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented light in the very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better. Furthermoreaddition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing coming come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions. This example can tell you right. The light came out soon after the invention of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or relation. As a result, successful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one. This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going, but stay behind. However, I dont want to overstate the advantage of my agreement, since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some scientific cases. Firstly, when people try to invent new things, it takes a long time to achieve the achievement. Secondly, 	To sum up, according the to above mentioned reasons and examples, successful people should try new things and take, becoming becomes more convincing to me, although it has some own negative aspects which we can not deny.","[""So different are personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions.

521,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not. Different people may make different decisions depending on their background. Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music. But according to my own personality and background, I can not agree with them. I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Reasons and evidences are listed as follows. The world now, unlike 100 years ago, needs a man who can only know one subject. It needs people who can have broad knowledge. For example, engineers now only need to know about engineering,but also need to have the ability to use a computer. Because most of their works are completed on computers. So if he is only a specialist in engineering, he will not finish his work perfectly. Furthermore,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choice for the future. It is hard to say that a student majoring in engineering will become an engineer after his graduation. It is common to see students in college change their majors. But a man only good at one subject will not have the free time to do so.","['It is a controversial problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not.

For example, students who are good at calculation study math for a long time and would also like to change the studying subject to a subject that can be read without using your hands or brain. Secondly, you can know what you are really interested in when you study a bit of various subjects. This is the reason why education doesn' t focus on a specific subject and it can also make up the choice of what we really like about a student after a long time of basic education till high school. For example, we decide what major we want to study after entering universities. We can decide by the interests we developed since we started elementary school. Furthermore, I believe with the advantage of learning everything a bit gives more opportunities to choose various jobs. we can use our broad knowledge instead of one specific idea to apply jobs we want in the future.

532,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know. I agree with this statement for many reasons. Successful people usually find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others' successful roads. It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of themselves. Because they want to protect them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. so they take more and more risks to increase, if they succeed their fame. In addition when you are a person who succeeds , you have to continue but not to be content with what you already are. Because there is a high degree of fighting spirit. For example, a very successful company of cell communication, which is faced with a new one whose prices are more available than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits. It is a new popularity and money entrance. All the same, even if having experience and using it is important , testing new methods is also good, because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas. So there is a popular short word: If you do not risk , you will not have anything. Successful people are known as people who are couragious, fighting, and humble. Because of all these previewing reasons successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view it is right. Being more successful is important for successful people and they used to choose this way. It is a paradox but it is also a law of nature. But some people only do that.","[""People do things in different ways. Successful ones try new things and take risks instead of using the ways they already know.

In a few years, our world has got so many machines and their' improvements, cars are one of them as well. This helped to people to build up many mechanical things such as cars, buildings, computers or even children's activities.

Since those computer games or GameBoy came out, they have stopped going around their houses, stopped running and hanging out with their friends outside of their houses, instead of these things stopping, they started to play inside their houses and stayed in their rooms, did not come out from there and they became much weaker because of these computer games. However, because of those technological improvements, people have started to get cars for each person much easier than before. The cost of cars is getting lower and lower, and car companies try to make and sell them as cheaply as possible with lots of benefits.

549,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money.

On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year.

There are some points of views that students already participate in enough communities. However, in my opinion this cannot be true in terms of. In this essay. I will briefly present two reasons supporting my opinion. Most of all, individualism causes young people nowadays not to concern themselves about their communities. Most families in this country have one or two children, and they cannot have a chance to experience cooperation. They grew up only with their parents and without any siblings so it is hard to know how to share or yield for others that can learn from a large family. As a result, these children tend to behave individually and do not think about others who need help. This is the main reason why I think young people hardly help others in their communities. Moreover, schools and other organizations require students to do something for society without their own will. What I mean is that this requirement has a bad influence on students. It may help students spend at least time volunteering but they will avoid helping others because of this rule, which is essential to go to a good school or get a better job in our country.

I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information, the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means to the era. Firstly, successful people always have a good spirit of friendship to exploit their life.

If the company still enjoyed stability, today's successful story would not exist. Further more, the companies which exploit the well of crude oil always try to find new resources by investing large amounts of money with huge risks. For these efforts, it deserved to get a lot of reputation and accumulate a fortune. Secondly, stability of today's life means returning to the past in this capitalism. Everyday, new information is revealed to the public and every individual must have a radar to catch it. For example, the auto maker company tries to new design to meet the customers' needs in the market However, they do not make an effort to make a new design of cars, the company will lose the people's consumption. By doing so, new investment and new design should be tried to keep the reputation and successful story. In addition, if a member of a computer program company has knowledge of the old version, he will lose his job and even previous skill.

However, cars may not be used in the future because people don't want to use them such as telecommuting, air pollution and price. To begin with, telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs. Thus, they don't need to use their cars;that's why, they work at home.

Also, prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car. This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future.

566,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is important that everybody enjoys their lives. But who enjoys it more, young people or older people? In my opinion, older people enjoy their lives more because they know what true enjoyment and freedom to do anything is. Firstly, adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what true enjoyment is. Youngsters call playing computer games, going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life. However it is too small to be an enjoyment inone's life. Older people enjoy their lives in a greater range. For example, the head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit, directing people and going to dinner with his family, which are far more enjoyable than playing computer games. Secondly, adults have the freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy. For youngsters to enjoy their lives, there are numerous things that are not permitted to do, such as drinking, traveling without parents. However, there is no such barrier for adults. For example, my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business. Then he told me that he would go to these beautiful places and would come back with a better future. I, after listening to him, immediately thought of all the stress that I was getting from school and planned a trip alone.","[""It is important that everybody enjoys their lives.

567,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being makes it easy to succeed in their common life. First, usually successful people attract more successful people. For example, these people can get to know their new boss or their new employee by having a cup of coffee with their friends. That is, this meeting provides them with the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and these kinds of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove themselves and normally, they are going to win, the people tell us that they are lucky people. It is said that successful people meet successful people, it is true that it provides them with the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance. Second, two important motors of human beings' behaviour are motivation and emotion. These people are really motivated to get new experiences, learnings and knowledge. And even, this behaviour makes them pleasure by increasing some chemical substances in their brain. For example, taking new risks, such as changing the location of living, taking a new job and meeting new colleagues are really activities that pleasure them. They are moved by their motivation and emotion in order to achieve their goals and to become satisfied with them and their environment. Finally, I think that success in life, that is, reaching their goals, can be got by trying new things and taking new risks. These actions enlarge a person's knowledge and information increases the critical perception of the world. people try new things and take risks to become successful people.

568,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age. Some people prefer a sedentary life style ,like working ,going home , watching TV. etc. These people never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimal as possible. Here I am giving an example of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he was young so when they grow older and retire ,they do not really have much hobbies or interests in their life so they would definitely say that young people enjoy life more probably because mainly when they leave home ,it is related to work. Not that they should not be working but they should find other things in life to enjoy and try to find something they like and learn how to better at ,or share it with friends ,etc. Second , another point to take into consideration is the surrounding environment where the person lives. Some people live in big cities where there is always something to do ,while others live in smaller communities where there is not much going on in their small town. Nevertheless it depends on where the person grewup ,not only on where they live,as for instance if someone grows up in a small town ,he might already know what to do in his spare time ,like may be go fishing if he lives in a city by alley or river ,on the other hand if a person grows up in a large city and it happens that he moves to that exact small city for whatever reason ,he may not know what to do there. Third , there is a different kind of enjoyment for every age ,it is just a matter of the person finding the appropriate way of enjoying his or her life. A person should be ready to accept the fact that he or she is getting older and at some stage of his life he or she might not be able to do the same kind of things that he is used to doing. Fourth,technology and computers have changed our lives. In a way positively impacted us by being able to find a lot of things on the internet and make it easier for all ages to find things they would like.","[""It is commonly said that young people enjoy life more than older people do however there are so many many points we have to consider before agreeing or disagreeing with such opinions First, and most importantly in my opinion it depends on the person 's character rather than his age.

572,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily cars today are indispensable to go to work for a lot of people. Secondly cars are more than that, their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors prospected, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years. First of all cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportation. If you consider big cities, you can not always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car. Furthermore I can not see any reason, why this state of being should change during the next twenty years. There will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore the most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily. Everyone, who has the comfort of owing a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future when this would be a chance, either. Lastly we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business. Decrease in consumption would help to kill a million jobs. Worldwide car producing industries hold so manymanz jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil. Here another job giving area exists that manz people depend on. I can not see that the influence politicians might have on that. Still a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect, that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years. Considering the facts it may be a good thing, if there were fewer cars, this would help our environment get healthier again. Even so the need and lack of alternatives will not chance the amount of cars during the next twenty years.","['For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

However, I support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years for the following reasons. First, the price of energy will become higher than today. For example, many people prefer cars which use less oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy. Many car makers are making their efforts to produce cars which need not so much energy, though, such cars are high cost. In addition, there is difficulty in developing new laws that cost energy. As the above explanation demonstrates, in the future, people will use fewer cars than there are today. Second, environmental problems change people's way of thinking about traffic methods. For example, in Asian countries such as South Korea, people put more importance on trains than ever because city environmental problems are so serious. Originally Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had not so much a train network. However, the South Korean government improved the capability of train networks in Seoul to carry people. The government will continue such efforts to make Seoul's air clean. Trains seem to replace the car-centric traffic system. As the above example demonstrates, there will be fewer cars today. Third, the reasons people buy cars are more limited than before. The car is not only a means of transport but also a symbol of rich life. However, people will change such an image of cars. For example, in European countries, where many people use cars for the first time in the world, simple cars are popular because many Europeans think cars are just a traffic method.

In the old days, people in Europe loved rich cars, though, such thinking is changing. In such a situation, they don't need so many cars if there is other traffic system such as trains."", 'As the above example shows.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
578,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death. Therefore, life doesn't only end when one gets old. People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action. However, older people tend to develop their mental intelligence and imagination. That's why most philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak in their career when they are old. As a consequence, they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields, or by writing and thinking about life in general. But do young people enjoy life more than older people do? I personally do not think it is the case. Young people tend to look at life in a more material way, playing in parks, having a girlfriend, practising sports, therefore, they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living. It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience. By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore, truly appreciate the meaning of life they are living. I saw once a film by a canadian director (Denys Arcand) named ""the barbaric invasions"" that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life. The main character, an old man, looks past his life: the different books he read, the different women he slept with. therefore, he becomes furious at not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young, he finally decides to commit suicide. This is a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves, and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when you are young. I think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest, whether young or old, by doing the things he enjoys doing the most. That is when he can reach a mental satisfaction, by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life which is to enjoy life.","['Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death.

593,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"Helping our community is very important. Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities, but it's not very often. I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason that I think that young people don't spend much time on their communities is the school rules.

612,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior. Some people believe in doing the same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful;but , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The reason, I think, is that We learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door to success. Therefore, by trying new things and taking risks,we learn something new which leads us to succeed eventually. One reason ,I believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us. When we try something new we learn about that field which helps us to grow. Take my wife's example. She was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up. At the beginning of her life she tried to make an attempt to work as a businessman. Surprisingly she has had tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty saloon. Successful people never stick to one profession.","[""When asked the question what the key to success is ,different people may hold different perspectives as per their own experience and behavior.

627,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life. Nowadays, schools are almost every where in the world, where people would try to get as much education as possible, so they can be the top person. Almost all modern schools teach many subjects to the students, such as Maths, science and history. However, learning many different academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject. Learning many different academic subjects has some benefits. Most importantly, people get to know many things and know briefly about everything, so they do not have to rely on others to do the work. Nevertheless, as the world is improving, the world is smaller because of the transportation of things and information. People can get others' strength more easily now. For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject. Thus, specialization is better. Not only is information going around fast is the reason why students should specialize, but also because of the good future.","[""Education is a very important part of one's life because it affects people's future and their knowledge of life.

For instance, a science student can get really good information on the history, a subject he/she is not good at, from the internet by a good historical student. This would save a lot of time for the science student to study a lot about history in order to understand the material well. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject can save a lot of time on studying the subjects one do not need and the saved time can be spent on the specific subject.

638,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks.

Human beings are hardly satisfied and I can't help thinking that when somebody has succeeded in something, he will always want more. Alpinists, for example, don't usually stop climbing after they manage to reach their first summit. They always want to climb an other mountain , harder and higher. Napoleon's Bonaparte, the french emperor and conqueror, didn't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finally defeated. And I think because he was successful for the first time, he couldn't get rid of his willpower. An other reason would be the fact that successful people can start being bored by what they do, even if their activity matches success. So to avoid this phenomenon, they just start a new thing. We can find this kind of behaviour in sports. We can take the example of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi, who had won dozens of world championships. Well, he is now looking forward to becoming a Formula one driver. Because he wants something new.","[""In my opinion, successful people try new things and are likely to take more risks.

Some assume that advertisements are the best way to show how your product is to the customers. I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons are; to sell more, to be the biggest company in the market. First of all the main reason why the products seem better is to sell more. With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product. For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food restaurants in the world. Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers. On the other hand their new burger, woopeer menu, misleads the costumeers. In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is. Plus they also show big meatballs. But a throuth is one burger can never be enough, you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger.","['Humankind always needs to earn more to reach good lifestandarts.

649,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In many situations, as human beings, people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occur once in a while. Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step to leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into a --- normal person. From not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life. To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But, when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists? This is because of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus, finally he got the Nobel prize for his achievements. Not only, will he be remembered but his work of investment and achievement on the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of society. Further more, a famous French writer called ""Silva Plyth"" is famous for the poems that she wrote, the sadness and emotions through her poems; by reading her poems, emotions and a sense of sadness would soon arise. She is not any different from any other poet but, the only aspect which is different would make her so famous, is the fact that her uses of metaphor and the descriptions of surroundings are known to be so precise and carry a sense of shady cloud through reading her work. This, made her work still popular and is now what many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style.

However, I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of the following 3 reasons. Firstly, understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something. For example, if a student understands the idea that why the sky looks blue when she is very young, she will know the ideas until she dies. She can also explain it to others who want to know about it. However, if women learn it by heart without understanding, there is a high possibility that they will forget about it. Secondly, understanding something has the power to apply to others.

Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies. Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do, such as knitting, watching movies, planting their own gardens. Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to the flowershop and looked for the special flower seeds. And when he got back home, he sprayed the water on the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it. The second reason is that not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots offriends. In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the trip was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend time with their friends and enjoy the time with them.

By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information. Huge topics and their contents can be covered in a minimum of time. But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned it. If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they really know it and will not forget it as quickly as they would if they just learnt it without understanding. So both sides have their positive and negative arguments. The quantity of information on the one hand, the long time argument on the other hand. Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not really understand or would you be better off with some information you can handle and understand? Well, the best way is surely the intermediate way. Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas. There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around. If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them. The topics are just too huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it. So one should not concentrate on just understanding ideas (this would take a lifetime) and one should not just learn facts. You would not know what to do with them. It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs that you have not learned, you are helpless. Referring to the question of the essay, there is no ""more important"".

Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details. Therefore the ability to make a comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible. For instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film can only tell one or two sentences. However a person who watched the film and read many things from the magazines about the film can make comments or discuss the film.

684,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play. Young people are physically healthier and have more energy than older people. People can enjoy their life by exercising such as hiking, dancing and swimming which are the activities that most people do to enjoy their life. However,older people have difficulties doing active sports. They do not enjoy exercise as much as young people do. Older people are physically venerable,so they have enough time to spend their time doing activities. They rather spend their time taking a rest and sleeping. Young people easily accept new technologies and use them. New technologies help people to experience convenient and fun things. Experiencing convenient and fun things leads to people enjoying their life. For example, when people travel by car, young people may use a navigator in the car which helps them to travel far easily. They can find the location they want to see simply. However, old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators. Figuring out how to operate the navigation system in cars is hard for old people. Thus, they do simpler trips while young people travel to diverse places. Old people are not likely to fertilize new machines to enhance their life. Young people usually have more passion than old people whatever they do. I think people need passion to enjoy their life. They have to try to find out how they can have fun where they can hang out for fun. They have to plan some activities.","['I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people are energetic, sensitive to new technology and, have a passion to play.

697,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"As my boss used to say to me at the beginning of my career: < Do not be afraid to try new things, do more than others do: no one has ever been punished for doing more>. According to this phrase, I think that people who try to do new things normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who simply does his/her usual job. What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to society. A lot of men can do things well, but only men who do things better than others can reach a higher level in social life. Taking risks is part of being a successful person. Someone who does not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by society.

There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius.

In the present era most young people have become self centred and they are not in a mood to know about the problems of the world. they are always seeking their own comforts. for example consider that if robbers have entered the neighbour's house of a man and he comes to know that, first he is taking care of the valuables in his house rather than helping his neighbour. nowadays, young people are lacking in moral and ethical values. they have become worse than the birds. i. e. if a crow dies or is wounded then a large number of crows gather at that place and shout,but when it comes to people if a person is met with an accident on a road most of them pass as if they dont see that incident. They did not even call an ambulance. instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness. According to me this system has to change,each human should help others. One person has to help atleast three people in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person has to ask those three individually to help three others. now nine people have been benefited and these nine have to help three others each individually.

Recent activities such as new programs which aim to encourage people to use their creativity in the projects. Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing the potential to produce a solution to problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that the person does not take risks in order to change the situation. Initially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. The way it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risks to create a new solution. Making observations can not be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience. In addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations which are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. if it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result. As in our immune system, our body will respond to the invading pathogens more powerfully in subsequent exposures than the first one. Besides these, human beings can sometimes be on pursuit of new tastes in order to renew their lives and refresh their souls. life consisting of eating and sleeping is not worth living so how many years you lived can not be as important as how you lived. People who are afraid of taking risks to add up their lives in fact do not want to violate their identities. Therefore they continue to go in the way which they know well. however, there should be differences between human beings and plants in order to put them into other groups.

Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier once you have finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you have received the job you can still and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for. Secondly, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extent there is some truth in it, but, undoubtedly, experience shows that no matter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same.

Some of them think it was time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communities, they will lack time to prepare their tests. Furthermore, if they could not study at famous universities, they would not have a bright future even if they took part in some communities. Second, young people have various kinds of things they need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope for independence. Many young people choose to do part-time jobs to earn more money and buy anything that they want. They may feel tired of taking part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience in their free time.

For example, consider a high school student. If he needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school, apart from his personal interest which he shows in a particular subject, the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome. Secondly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, the frequency at which we do get updates about these subjects greatly matters. We need to have a greater frequency of updation in all areas, which is not a simpler task. For example, consider a student studying Computer Sciences.","['The given statement is ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"".

732,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right. Take math for example, during my high school days, I had to answer lots of questions. A math teacher explained the concepts first, and then made us answer questions. If I could understand the concepts, it was not difficult to answer the questions. So when I studied other subjects such as chemistry and physics etc. I applied the same method, that is, understanding the concepst, first. Here is another example. In terms of parenting, especially money related, I think good parents are not the people who can give big money to their children but teach them how to make money. You might think this is a different story, but it is related to the topic, I think. All parents want their children to be successful and rich. But there are types of parents. One just tells their children how they made money, and instructs them to do something to make money without explaining what the concepts behind the facts are. Another type wants to explain what is important and more important. They know that facts will change, yet if you can understand the concepts behind the facts, you can improvise to any circumstances. Many young people inherit big money from their parents, yet for those reasons I mentioned above, lots of people don't maintain their wealth. Things are always changing, and I think along with the changing surroundings the facts can be changed.","[""Through my experience, I can say that this statement is right.

733,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with the opinion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts for them. I will explain the three reasons. First, I think understanding concepts is basic. You can't build a tall building without rock as a basis even though you may build a short block like a house on the sands. If you learn the facts without an accurate concept, you may hear you are smart at first. But eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of facts will collapse. Second, I think you should experience the proper process. Everything has an order in process. Understanding concepts is a start. So you can't understand further facts without them. If you skip something , you will meet trouble in the end. Speaking again, If you ignore the process of understanding accurately, you will find you didn't even know an easy thing. Third, you should understand the academic thing as a whole. All the stories and facts link together. You should understand something through another thing. If you learn facts separately, it seems like you see the tree but can't see the forest. So I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts.

735,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"It's a very interesting topic to write on. Yes i agree with the phrase that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The people who have succeeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful people. when people achieve success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame. At present, successful people are taking huge risks to attain more money and fame,this is because they have the strength in many ways like money,confidence,faith in other people also. A person who is not successful cannot take any risks because he is not having enough money,confidence,strength of mind,and also faith in other people. Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsuccessful people. Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata bought the stakes in the steel company for a much higher price than in the world. He has the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy stakes for such a high price. He knows the way to grow the business, and an unsuccessful businessman can buy the stakes for such a high price. Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets success and another takes a regular film which is a flop,who again takes the risk of talking about another variety film, definitely the successful one. So I agree that successful people take risks rather than only doing what they already know. I hope most people agree with the topic because every one knows the value of success in life.","[""It's a very interesting topic to write on.

Some think that doing what they already know how to do well is better, contrary to those who think that trying new things and taking risks is more important to be successful. In my opinion, I personally agree with the second idea. These are the following reeasons. First of all, taking risks is important to struggle with the difficult life conditions. For example, some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such as jogging, cycling. Of course all sports are beneficial for most of them. However , if people want to enjoy life more and be more healthy , they should try new and risky sports. They shouldn't be afraid of them doing risky sports. In addition to this, taking risks is a fundamental issue because of the experience of life more deeply. For instance, i always do the most difficult tests first at school. Because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it. Although it means taking risks, i prefer to do it and anytime i am not in a bad situation.","[""Mankind always needs to take risks to achieve good life standards therefore taking risks is a very important aspect of human life.

They may have little knowledge or even be non-educated, but they have desires to explore the new world.', 'Unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning, and stopped there.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
747,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"In my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts where it could bring out the natural talents in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room. Understanding the ideas and concepts makes the childern think more scientifically and discover more new things about a particular concept it inculcates a habit in children to analyse things in a more broad way and arrive at the results on their own. Understanding things rather than learning things from facts from the class room helps the child to remember the things for longer and in inculcate new ideas in arriving at new ideas which help them in a long way to go. Also, learning concepts and ideas rather than learning facts which were written or told by some one helps to develop a desire for inviduality in the child and to evaluate the issues in a rather broad way standing different from others. For example one of my friends with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed an idea which he implemented in one of his projects and his project was selected to be demonstrated at NASA in the United states. and he was also rewarded by the president of my country as the best out standing research student in his age group. Learning concepts and ideas would also children in their education where he could he could he could be interested in fields like research and things that really do matter a lot and even have lots of influence on his/her professional career. concepts and ideas and are not only confined to four walls of a room where these could be obtained from many places in nature in books in people and even in him self. Finally i would conclude knowledge of ideas and concepts is a large ocean where there is no age barrier one doesn't have to understand the concept and implement his ideas inpractice.","['In my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts where it could bring out the natural talents in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room.

753,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts. On the one hand are people, who try new things and take risks to fulfil their goal. On the other hand are people, who do what they already know to do well. Such two different types of handling with risk will reach the final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1. 2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economy or in general with business took place for him with 26 years in a big company as an apprentice for law specific questions for constructing contracts. He was very resistant to risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experience, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2. 5, which was the middlefield in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, who needed his help regularly. During such periods he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. Banks helped him to fulfil such a goal by offering a lot of money. After two years he had had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4. 500. 000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. The concept failed because of the crash of the new market and he lost all the standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time. As a conclusion to my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. Moreover people with an ability to try risks, will have faster success and will stay there, if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparison to the risk resident people face. However, every human being has to know for himself or herself which goals and objectives he or she wants to achieve and how fast to get there. In addition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success.","['The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be split into two parts.

761,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I do not agree with this statement because younger and older people have different ways to enjoy life. Life is not about age whether it is a young person or an older person, but instead about the symbolism of joy is a way of enlightening and bringing happiness. Younger people might think or have the idea that they are the only ones to enjoy life, but at what cost. Older people have the treasure of wisdom among knowledge, with a conviction of lots of experience, they have the mature and most important quality, patience. I have seen older people enjoying life more then younger people, but also, comes to a cost of good health. I have seen many older people that enjoy life as if they have the hearth of a twenty year old person. To me, life enjoyment is a long term learning experience that brings individuals to understand the meaning of enjoyment of life. When one is young, one can think that they have the energy to impose them selves on the world that they are indestructible and this might bring to a short end of life. A few years ago, I was talking to an old friend, he told me one important thing that marked my life for good: ""the diable is not smart because it is the diable, it is because the diable is old""; it is like the young or old wine, or like the age of the wiesky, what is it better an 8-year - old wiesky or a 24-year - old aged in a barril, I would go for the 24-year - old aged in a barril.

764,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects,while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject. As for me, I would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only. Though there are a variety of subjects at a university for you to follow with. But a single man's energy and time are so limited that you can't afford wasting too much time on subjects that have nothing to do with your future career. Imagine a freshman majoring in Physics with a Selection Of English Literature in hand all day around, will he succeed in his field someday? Hardly. Furthermore, we call these ""academic subjects"" because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school. They are far more complex and complicated. You can't expect to manage it within a semester or two. It needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level in a certain field. Some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because of an affection on the spur of the moment, as soon as he realizes that he won't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever, he will just simply drop halfway.","['Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects,while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject.

First, understanding ideas opens up very good and big ways of thinking. It makes you think and respect other people's opinions.

For example ,lets take my young cousin,when his family went on holiday including his grandfather who is 70 years old,my cousin explored the whole city and visited many religious places,which made him happy or he may enjoythat. while his grandfather who is also interested in seeing those places, was due to his physical weakness and due to the temperature variance he didn't resist at that place. And many places are in hilly areas which are to be travelled by walk,as his grandfather had no strength and he didn't enjoy the trip. Young people have many ways to enjoy their life at maximum. Nowadays, young girls are the main factor in their enjoyment,they go out with their girl friends in which they find much enjoyment. But older people can't do that as they are married they are restricted in theirlimitations. This is a silly example but it is a huge reality statement.

800,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I strongly disagree that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts. Currently, A lot of people do nt have a lot of time as much as a long time ago. Therefore, time has become very important in our student life. Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example. I saw the information through a diagram of smart people,When some journalist asked a question about how they studied? Most people who made good score people said ""I used to spend a lot of time thinking hard. In my conculsion, Through our life, time becomes the most important thing in our social life.

Facts have more varied phonemes and are interesting for students to understand. It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts. People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book. For example, in a chemistry class, if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do? They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students imagine. It is the easiest way to show the process of the reaction, like the colors, sounds, smell. Also, it has the variety of facts which can attract the students' attention. If a teacher does not use the facts in class, the students might feel tedious and bored listening. At that time, they will move their attention to other things. They will cause bad effects to understand the knowledge. In conclusion, it is interesting to use facts more than memorize them. It is also a good way to help the student to remember the method by proving it through the facts. Sometimes people might not understand what the teacher is talking about in class. They need better improvement to improve their understanding. For example, the students may not understand what the wave is like.

The main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too.

814,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts since it offers lots of advantages to students.

For example, when I was a high school student, I would attend the experiment in science class in the laboratory. it makes me solve the teacher's prompt which makes me get a complicated theory inscience. In addition , the course in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomena such as global warming , soil erosion, and so on which make me a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, I agree that students must focus on understanding rather than learning facts since they would be logical. secondly, as students under standing ideas, they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which make all around the world thrive more than before. For example, when I was a middle school student, I would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness.","[""I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts since it offers lots of advantages to students.

On the other hand, we young people do not be afraid of new life or the environment because we have a lot of dreams for a new world.

But, some people, in order to become more and more famous, will take too many risks. people who adopt this strategy have to be very careful. On the other hand, we trend to forget the negative sides of this strategy. Actually, if you take risks to succeed in your life, it will cause issues such as financial issues. For instance, you own a shop. You have to finance this shop, by getting a lot of money for it. If this shop doesn't work in the long run, you will have debts. It may lead to financial issues with your bank. According to me, it is a lack of consciousness, especially when you are in charge of a family. This argument is far from being useless.

For as long as I can remember, I used to enjoy life when I was fourteen the same way I do now. I mean, the years pass by, and time goes on, but we still enjoy it in different ways. This must depend on how we see life and what we expect from it. For example some weeks ago, I was talking with my grandfather about his early years in college. He told me about his affairs and adventures during that time, but later the talk came deep and he talked to me about his present. He told me about how he fought against cancer, and how that makes him feel, how hard he is trying to keep waking up each day.', 'I was hearing him, not feeling comfortable and with the situation and intrigued with his future.']","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}","{'sent0': False, 'sent1': False}"
829,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Yeh , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, because it will help them to have a grip on the concept. Studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student, the student's knowledge develops only when he thinks about the topic. How did he/she get that thinking? once if they are having some grasp or idea on the topic. The student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity. I am agreeing with the concept because I have had practical experience once up on a time. Two students in my class attended an exam full of practice. I am explaining the practice module of both of the students, one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day without any breakage and also without any idea. And the other person who is also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept.

831,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"""Young people are strong and dynamic"" These words are proved by great scholars and philosophers of our country. I strongly agree with the statement which is followed. ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"". enjoyment should be done only when you are young because its the age to have fun. young people are more dynamic and strong and when they grow up they will be very strong and body parts will also grow. Young people have a life in them where they should make some memories for the future life. And young people can really have a fun time with their friends and relatives and lead their lives to the fullest. young people still have the life which has just started. Some young people can really enjoy life hanging out with friends and having a fun time. Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way. they have the life which they have in their hands. Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs. they feel experimenting with them is an enjoyment. But those r not really enjoyable things in fact which apoil the carrier of the youngster. those kinds of enjoyment are restricted and enjoyment should be done so that he has a good time and good memories which he can share with his young generation. Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more ability to enjoy themselves. Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment. But older people cannot have as much enjoyment as youngsters as they have no energy and capability to enjoy themselves. Older people will have to think about their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories. Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying themselves. Those youngsters' ages don't permit them to control themselves from having fun. even in school or at educational places we have special time for refreshing and enjoyment for youngsters. This is only because youngsters should have enjoyment equally with studies. It is a saying by our great schoolteachers saying""All work no play makes a man lazy"" youngster needs some fun apart from their routine education life. this is mainly to have peace of mind and relaxation Young people are more flexible when compared to old people they can do any adventure, whereas old people all depend on young people. Young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more time and interest in enjoyment and youngsters have to give importance to enjoying life to make themselves active on all basis. young people really have great energy and enthusiasm for enjoyment they can enjoy the whole day but they dont get tired this is only because of their interest. this interest is to be provoked in studies. Therefore i totally agree with the above statement saying ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do""because older people should have sweet and unforgettable memories in their age and this can only be done by older people only if they enjoy their life in the young age.

I'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion. In the first place, they including CEOs and ad makers are trying to make their products seem better than the product's reality because if they do that, they can make more money. For example, there is a car commercial which is shot in paradise. If they do that, people, most consumers, would expect that we'll be there if we buy this car. As a result of this, by shooting the commercial in the ideal place, the car company would make a lot of income. Second, I want to argue my opinion using the current situation. Many countries, especially developed ones, the rate of asking for refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies. This situation has not only happened in famous companies but also small, developing companies. Why is it happening? I think that because of the unreality of advertising this situation. In addition, if the companies did that again and again, they would be charged more money and make this worse. I've read the article about this problem, in which the expert said since many companies are pouring their money into commercial and ads, they can't afford to use their money to improve their products.

838,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide. I agree with the passage, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"" I will give the following two reasons why a trip with a tour guide is the best way. First, tourists can deepen their knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide. Most tourists are not familiar with the place; they don't know about the language people speak and the history, what manner and behaviour people respect and so on. Therefore, tourists are necessary to inform tourists what interesting there is ; as a result, they have fun in the place. Next, tourists need a tour guide who can lead them there. They may lose their way, and be in trouble with the particular language and culture. For example, American children who go to Singapore receive a heavy punishment in order to not follow the rule there: they throw their gum in the public place.","['As the touring company is more popular recently, the students in the school, some communities and some groups of families go on trips with a tour guide.

843,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people. As far as my view is concerned i would like to put some reason behind my accent on the topic. First young people are more enthusiastic,hasty,inexperienced, While elderly people are well endowed with wisdom, prudence , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoying life, Although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities,they enjoy less. Secondly,they have less opportunities to enjoy themselves as their strict schedule doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoyment. However,they did enjoy themselves at the time of their sophomore year because they did not have such a burden of responsibilities to maintain and did not have the responsibility to maintain the family. I would like to give an example of my father who is a manager in a company, When i was a toddler he taught me to take first firm few steps in the path of my life and gave me good quality education by enrolling me in a good public school where i could set fort my academicjourney, so he has the responsibility to give me a good career in the path of my life by giving much attention to me he rather by enjoying himself he gave me platform to secure me future to path of success. Also, if we look at the cut throat competition between the world there is not enough time for elderly people to enjoy life Although this same holds for younger people, they could be able to manage time for their enjoyment. It is also important for younger people to enjoy it because of the study burden because i believe that a healthy body can dwell in a healthy mind so for the future success they must be stress free. Enjoyment for younger people i believe that it is a dose for their tired nerves and if taken this dose will soothe their tired nerves and rejuvenate them for the upcomming responsibilities.","['yes i agree with the topic, young people enjoy life more than older people.

Many companies have made many DM and advertisements to attract their customers. For the company, they just want people to buy their products. The advertisements are just a way to present their thoughts. However, the real product is not really like the advertisement. The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thoughts to their customers. Maybe they did not talk about how to use the products any more. They want the climents to keep their eyes on them. That is business. On the other hand, now there are many companies that sell their stuff in the TV show. They provide the time to use their products.

845,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this. When people watch television, read newspapers or walk in the street, they see a lot of advertisements. Even though people don't concentrate on that, they already have influenced. The first problem is the company cheats the customers. When the company makes a commercial for selling a product, they usually try to show their products as the best and they tell them only good points. Because they made people believe that products didn't have any defects and customers but it. However, there are also many bad points. It is one of the cheating. The other one is overconsumption. The commercial stimulates people to want to get those products and actually they don't need them, but they buy them. Sometimes buying is caused by developing the economy, but typically it has to disappear. The third reason is cost. If they make an advertisement, they need money and when they make an advertisement that looks better, they have to pay more. It is going to be caused by the increase. The increase will cause poor people to suffer from money. The purpose of companies is to make money. Whereas they earn money, people's savings decrease. The companies must make good products and after customers will be able to judge them.","[""Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this.

After long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the colour and the used time. Under the circumstances, successful people try new things and taking risks is much better.

Last but not least, trying new things helps you to get more experience and self-confidence. By doing these new things you will be prodded and everybody will love you.

The motivations for that kind of trip are only to relax and have a good time. Some people need this time, in this rush society where all the things pass very fast. Some people need space to enjoy themselves and have time to themselves. For these reasons I believe if you decide to have your time the best way to travel is alone. But the other way is if you want to enjoy yourself and take a trip for educational reasons you will choose to go with a group and guide. The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go to. In this occasion I think the best way to travel is in groups because in groups you can share ideas, information and you can learn in a social environment. Another example that illustrates my point is this: suppose two men decide to make a trip to El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico). The motivations of the first person are to have a good time with friends and explore all the forest, but the motivation of the second person is to have a good time reading in the high of the mountain. The first person will agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, but the second person will agree that the best way to travel is to be alone, without a guide.

In the old days, education was one of the important needs people might consider. That is because of the great enthusiasm young people might have towards accomplishing their responsibilities. For example, the percentage of failure in senior-high school was 30% in the Middle East between 1989-2000. However, between 2001-2006 the probability of failure has been highly increased to 70%. This statistic tells us that young people nowadays do not have the potential to accomplish their responsibilities, in order to respond to it in several generations after them. This also may cause the community and society to have a lack of Education that might affect the city financially. Money has been one of the main problems society is having.

It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius.

Another example is the food industry- what they say to be healthy often turns out to be theopposite, if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back.

Success and what are the essential ingredients which make a situation or a person successful? In simple terms, success is achieving goals with maximising efficiency. To set a goal for himself and envision the future is what successful men do differently. In life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of those decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally.

He gained most of his financial strength from people's money. He also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business.

879,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do? yes, i agree with this opinion. Obviously, today we enjoy our lives more than the older generation, because we face a different time. First, with the development of our society, young people have more chance to learn about different life on this planet through TV programs, the internet or other media. A young man always has a great interest in new things. They like to enjoy different life and are eager to get more amazing experiences. For example, in china so many older people spend so much time caring for their grandchildren, or staying at home to watch TV.

Obviously, today we enjoy our lives more than the older generation, because we face a different time. First, with the development of our society, young people have more chance to learn about different life on this planet through TV programs, the internet or other media. A young man always has a great interest in new things. They like to enjoy different life and are eager to get more amazing experiences. For example, in china so many older people spend so much time caring for their grandchildren, or staying at home to watch TV.

880,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"It is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good. However, it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized. I strongly agree that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient. There are several reasons. First of all, most students learn a lot of subjects in school and have exams in each semester. However, it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part. For example, I learned many subjects from academic institutions such as history, nuclear  physics, and pantam physics. But i am the president of an online-game company now, those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me. Second, people can learn from their peers and family about something like history, music or art. Most sportsmen who play in Major League Baseball in the United States and Premier League Soccer in the U. K. in my country have learned their specific area for their life without studying a broad field.","['It is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good.

881,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. In my opinion, if you understand the concept, you always have time to learn facts or dates. In children's education, for example, it's important to give them instruments to understand nature and society. I think it's not so important to fill them with dates and facts. Moreover, if a child understands a concept, he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life. If he learns a fact without understanding it, he will forget it in a month. For example, i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old, just because my teacher explained the meaning of them. I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explanation of them. If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it, the children have no sense and don't pay attention to it. The same is true in adult education. In the university of medicine, for example, it is much more important to understand how to visit a patient, than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body. You always have time to take a book and learn it.","[""I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

884,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I love my car and can`t give up using it and I don ` t agree with the statement that says there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. I have three major reasons to say that. One of them is that newer types of car are being produced and the second is that transportation by car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that have to be made for people to transport The first reason for not agreeing with the statement is that i think rather than extinction, newer types of car are being produced. These types include cars which work with electrical power, hydropower and in the next future i`m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things. There are also plans to create cars which are flying near to the surface and this will provide a place for some more cars. The second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap. Now the usage of cars is very huge. There are other ways of transportation for example planes. They can`t belong to anyone in the world but a car can be used by mostpeople. Nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country advances. Cars are effective for transportation for many people The third reason for not agreeing with this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes. They should be very expensive changes, that are needed to compensate for the need for transportation of the increasing population of the world.

Moreover, interacting with friends takes most young people's time. All of these activities occupied every minute of them. Second, education from young people's parents does not give them the idea.

895,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Shaping of the human thinking style is possible. It is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them. This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families. There are two ways to teach something to somebody. The first one is teaching the reasons, therefore the ideas and concepts. By this technique the student will be learning what is going on. There he will have the power to make judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned. For example, he/she will be able to fix something he has learned by means of repairing it, or will be improving that thing. In two cases what happens is natural. However, this method seems to be the best fit for a fast evolution, and has a negative side. The other side of the magic is that this process will be extremely time consuming, when the number of things to be taught increases. The other side of the magic is learning by facts. In this case, the learning curve is steep. Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts, he/she will not be able to comment about them in the future. So this stuff will be prone to degregations. In addition, the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is a genius.","['Shaping of the human thinking style is possible.

Even some people say "" Time is more important than Gold. The student also doesn't have time to. As a result a lot of students have just learned about only ideas and concepts. Actually this way to study is easier and can savetime. it will have a bad effect on students. When they learn about more hard things. therefore we have to start to fix the way we study only to understand ideas and concepts. The basic information made us think. Most students who just understand ideas and concepts do nt live the thinking like students who learn facts. For example, During the test time few students just write answers or Although take a lot of time few students spend the time finding the answer with facts. After testing if time is very limited, the student who wrote just the answer will get a better score than other group students. but Next time when they start at the same time and take the harder test than last time. The result will be different. Because few students know how to connect between new questions. But the other students know how to do that. Making it easy to work the brain. The learning fact makes the student think more, so the brain works more hard. If they keep doing the study the same way. As time goes by, the student brain is easier to circulate. For example.

As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point of view. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows: Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisements because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and at any time, on TV, on the radio, in the supermarket, on cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering because of these kinds of advertisements. Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertising is to appeal to buyers. With the development of high-technology, products are easily produced and designed. they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function. How a factory or a supermarket can win in such a keen competition is the key. Although honesty is very important in modern society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produce. So those products should have seemed much better, beautiful, functional than they really are.","['When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

912,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate.

They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem. Most people believe like that advertisement. What is the most cause of that. First, when they sell something to people , first they think about how they can sell it to a product. THey decided who needed this product. For example if somebody is obese , who eats a lot offood. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way of losing weight. The person believes that , because she or he needs to lose weight. If the person sees on the television like this advertisement, the person without thinking calls the product home. The second cause is, that people without seeing already order the product. They just see on the television. The reason is when the salesman sells his or her product they show a different kind of product. For example I have had a lot of weight and thought about that a lot. How to lose weight. One day I was watching on the television when I saw an adversisement. This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see the person , who is walking around the room. A few days later my order came and that I was disappointed about, because It was really really unfortunate.

913,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because,when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself. When a student has understood a certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself. By understanding it the student will be able to answer any type of question on that topic. For example let us consider that a student is studyingmotor. The student needs to understand the main idea and what the concepts are that are related to that topic. And how the motor works and many more things about the motor. But,less importance should be given to learning facts. Let us consider another example, let us consider one of the topic from the student subjects. The student must know what is the main idea and the concepts of that particular topic rather than learn facts on that particular topic. When the student is focused on understanding the ideas and concepts on a particular topic. When we arise any doubts about those topics they will be able to answer that doubt.","['I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because,when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself.

915,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination. of course every idea can be based onfacts. but sometimes it's wrong because students have to try to think of things someyears ago. many schools force students to study with formulas and memorize only facts. they didn't allow students to speak their opinions freely. but these days, many systems have changed in school. they encourage students' creative activity. when childhood is important to students they don't know much about society and the future and around many things.

917,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Every one knows that when we are learning we learn facts and ideas. No one in the world can change the facts because facts are facts. Some people just like to know the facts and they do not pay attention to other ideas. In my case, I strongly believe that understanding ideas is more important for students than understanding facts. I think like this because of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respond to others, it makes you creative and makes you persuasive. First, understanding ideas opens up very good and big ways of thinking. It makes you think and respect other people's opinions. If we look at facts, we will find that most of thefacts were just ideas in the past and by discussing them they become facts. Second, trying to understand ideas is a good way to make your brain work. It makes you create new ideas and new opinions. On the other hand, understanding facts is like opening your mind, putting things in it and closing it. Third, understanding ideas led you to the facts. I believe that most of the facts are conclusions to ideas. If you understand the idea you can easily figure out the fact. I think understanding ideas teaches us how to be a persuasive person because when you are trying to get a result from an idea, you are following certain and clear steps. This certain way of thinking can appear in your personality. Finally, I believe that understanding ideas is very important but also we can not say understanding facts is not important. We should know the main and important facts of every thing. On the other hand, we do not make understanding facts our way of learning and thinking.

919,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"This is not completely true. Indeed, I think that success is achievable in both ways. Some people build emperors doing the same thing all life long, quite as a south-italian farmer emigrated to Canada after World War II. In Italy he was a well known mozzarella producer, and once he established himself in Canada he began the same activity, with the same method, day after day, and now he is one of the richest men in the country, exporting his famous mozzarella throughout North America. Maybe nowadays in such a competitive market this kind of experience has become rare, because of globalization involving all the 5 continents that causes the rise of new competitors everywhere and because of the growth of multinational companies with uncountable capital. What is interesting is that in this statement' is that in our own life, fossilizing ourselves is a practice to avoy. A new idea, a different vision of life, the market, and so on, can cause a sudden success in our work place, family, group of friends or even in our school, and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position in this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study, to find a job, to be competitive in a single word. A clear example of this situation is the advertising world. How can I convince people to buy my product? how can i make them understand that my product is better than others? With ads obviously, but we are surrounded by ads! In the streets, on television, on the radio, on the newspapers, on the web, during sports events, everywhere basically, and as a consequence of this, people no longer pay attention to ads. So an advertiser must find something new, something that attracts the attention of the crowd, and so he has to take risks, to innovate his approach.

927,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us.

If we against them and do not buy this kind of company's products , they will be gone. After that actually we can trust the people. We dont have to think twice before we buy something. The most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people. If you lie to someone, even though you will tell the truth next time, they wo not believe you.

We will never forget this.","[""I definitely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It's the way to sell products a few times. First of all, for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things. It does nt matter what kind of product it is, they don't want to spend a lot of money on their products. Because they want to earn more and everybody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it. Advertisements show these products as if they are great. Obviously they lie to people. But companies don't know that its not a good idea to do that. Maybe for a few times they will earn more money than they expected. However later on , these products lost their popularity. Because people understand that these products are not as good as they hope. People absolutely know what is good for them. So that company will fall down as fast as it grew up! It will lose all its money, probably more than it earned from the first time. I think the best way to produce products is to make them as well as the company can. After this ,they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way. I believe that people must be against these kinds of products, because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us. Maybe if we were against these products that they are not good as adversisements show to us , Maybe our grandchildren wouldn't see this kind of lie and bad products.

By having deep information and significant experiences on an issue, people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job, salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area. The first advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compared to other people. Because, companies today generally look for people with a specific topic. The reason for this is that today's companies are working on a detailed subject. It is clearly seen that there are not so many companies that work in different areas.

It might be worse if it influenced his church numbers because all the elders of the church did not agree with his opinion. However, He began it against all environments and conditions. So some of the church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harsh punishment for the new church.

Some people say that the numbers will decrease because alternative transportation will be popular in the future. However, I firmly believe that cars' occupation will increase because of the lack of technology and economic growth. Firstly, the technologies to make other good modes of transport are not developed yet. Although modern technology has developed to a higher point, it is hard to make more economical and popular transportation than cars in twenty years. In the future, other modes of transport such as sky-train will appear, but not in twenty years. Besides, economics are growing consistently to the extent to support non-wealthy people, These will make most people afford to and maintain their cars. It is a similar result to computer occupation. Ten years ago, there were low rates of having computers. However, now, almost every house has one or more cuputers. According to research by the Administration of Transportation of Korea, the number of cars in Korea has increased by 400 percentage points in the past twenty years. This shows that the car occupations will enhance.","[""It is debatable whether the number of cars will be fewer in twenty years or not.

946,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I disagree with the topic. Young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities. Even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading. They really show up and help when the time comes for doing that. Consider the example of Katrina hurricane. The hurricane left many people homeless and made many children orphans. During that time students and other young people through out the world gave help. Students have established many camps around the victimized areas to help the people. Many people from foreign nations have also helped their best by donating their pocket money. Even though many of the students are busy with their college schedule, they devote some time to social service. Many students from clubs in their college help the underprivileged kids and others. This I am stating from my personal experience. I am a member of a rotract club in college. Me along with some other students have arranged a camp in college to encourage the underprivileged kids.

From my point of view, I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. To begin with, pure learning ideas and concepts make students confused about the subjects. For instance, if a student just knows the definition of something, he would think it is unchangable. But when he meets the changes of this concept, he will be confused about this. It is because he does not know about the realities. If he had already learned facts about this, he would face this in a proper way and not get into a puzzle. In addition, students always get more interest in learning facts than just knowing the definition. In contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts, learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding. That is to say, learning facts about the definitions is more interesting than knowing the concepts. Finally, learning facts could make students think in a realistic way and it is good for their future. It is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt to society and live in the world directly and more successfully. Because they already knew the facts. Besides, students can also use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas. In summary, it is obvious that ideas and concepts are much more important for students to learn than just understanding for the reason of the clearness of the reality, student's interests in the subject and the benefits for their future. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that students should learn facts from the ideas and concepts. It is very good for their mental health.","[""In our modern society with a global economy improving rapidly, it is very important to educate high quality students catering to the desires of society.

As per my view looking at present day science , it is better to have a lot of knowledge of many subjects. As science is in a phase of revolution and today's necessities that people should have an interdisciplinary person. Another point is that using a multidimensional approach to solve any problem. Firstly, now a days it's time for revolution and renovation. Since, time is changing and we are in the 21st century, so we have rebuilt many concepts because today science has achieved so much and technology is also in very good condition. We also have to find out some answers to many questions which are not solved yet. Therefore, we have to gain knowledge of many subjects to improve our ideas. Secondly, we should try to get enrolled in various new and interdisciplinary subjects. Here I want to say that at present time we should try to get acceptance in various new subjects and it's much better to take an Interdisciplinary subject. By studying an interdisciplinary subject, we can gain knowledge of a variety of subjects. For example, applied sciences can provide a vast knowledge of various subjects, which we can't get from any specialized subject. Another example may be in Bioinformatics, where we learn and read various subjects such as Biology, Computersciences, Information technology, Maths, Statistics, Physics and Chemistry. So I think this type of student can work much better and can handle various types of problems. Thirdly, a multidisciplinary approach can solve some critical problems. At present, it is a very nice idea to be a multidimensional person. For example, in any research institute there is a problem which involves Physics, Mathematics and Biology, then here is a problem that not any person knows all the things so here a person having multiple subjects knowledge can do well. So that we can make a model and can solve a problem without any problem. Therefore, I can say on the basis of these some points that it is better to have a knowledge of various subjects.

To me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies, so the entire population depends on advertisements which show ""incredible products"" which can resolve many different problems, such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain, or how to repair a part of the furniture; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program. In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and wastes a lot ofmoney. For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one).

977,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I totally agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are several reasons, they spend too much time on their jobs, they are not familiar with the people in their communities and unwilling to try to get to know them, and they prefer to spend their own time on other pleasures. In the technology generation, people spend more time on their jobs because they arecompetitive. They have to work very hard to keep their jobs. They have to spend a lot of time to achieve the achievements. They have to work as long as possible to show their loyalty to their boss. That causes the average time in office increased and there is no time left for the communities. Besides, modern society is becoming more conservative than before because of the increasing crimes. People don't say hello to strangers. They treat the strangers with a suspicious manner. That makes people unwilling to get involved in community services. I heard that someone had tried to raise a fund for the community services but the door was shut heavily because he was thought to be a cheater. Also, in the city, there are many attractive pleasures, such as karo-oki, pubs, dancing clubs.","[""I totally agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

978,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"Products seem much better than they really are? I agree. These days the best seem product is the best seller. For me there are three reasons why this happens. First the price of the product. Second the way of the owner presents the product tosociety. Last but not least the quantity of money that the producer will spend on making the product. Let's talk about price. The money is the one that moves the world. In the United States the biggest society class is the middle one , that means the worker class. Most of the population will be looking for the cheap product. The advertisements make the product look good and if the price is good people will buy the product. The first impression of the product, is what we first look at. The promotion is very important, if the advertisements convince the person thatthe product is good they will buy it. Also people do not have too much time to look at the difference between the products and if in the promotions it says that it is the best seller you will buy it without notice that doesn't mean that it is the best one. The company cost for making the productis the most important thing forthem. Alot of companies prefer safe money, to selling to the people a good product. A good example of that is the food, natural food is better but artificial flavor is cheapest, so flavor maybe it will be better but it is not because it is not natural. In conclusion will produce will make them products seem better than other because ofmarket competition. My advice is to always look for the contents of the products if they are foot, medicines or any supplements. If it is a transportation like cars, equipment, etc ; look at the material that is composed of which will help you to know which one is better.","[""Products seem much better than they really are?

979,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Students have many choices of their study methods. Learning facts are outweighted to understanding concepts in three ways because learning facts is easy, quick and efficient. Firstly, facts are not abstract concepts and ideas so it is easier to be comprehended by students. Besides that, it is easier to remember a fact than the long definitions. In daily class, teachers always like to use some examples and facts to support their or her opinion. When people talk to each other, someone throws a fact that nobody heard before, people will think that person is knowledgable and it is easy for those listeners to retell the facts to others. Secondly, learning facts is a fast way to learn. Most of the facts do not contain only one concept or idea applied in the books. Since facts are not as simple as concepts and ideas, people are able to learn towns of concept and ideas through one fact. This can shorten the time of study because people only need to learn several facts and these facts may cover all the concepts and ideas in the books. Last but not least, efficiency is another important factor that made me think that learning facts is a better way to learn concepts and ideas. People live in society and things happen every second.","['Students have many choices of their study methods.

980,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"I agree with this opinion : Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are 3 reasons why I do. The pictures of advertisements are usually very attractive. For example, the picture of the apartment's part of the room. It always seems larger and brighter than they really are. However, when the customer actually visits the apartment, they say the room is not as good as they expected. Also, sometimes it is not as clean as the advertisement picture. The goods which the company sells are also more simple than the company says such as music players. The company sings that the products of them can be recorded and played more clearly than the productions used to be. However, sometimes there is no difference between the new ones and the old ones except the price. There is one more reason here. Our imaginations help to think better when we see the advertisements. If we watch the commercials on TV, we get a good impression at first even though we don't know how the products really are. Then we think we want it, but when we see the products with our eyes, we are disappointed with them. It is because the products are not as attractive as our imaginations. For these 3 reasons, I think most advertisements are not as good as they really are. They commerce just good points of the products, but we need to have critical thinking.

Then some people get poison from that product because they use cheap things. Also , In the US , some companies give an advertisement to a television channel like 10 times a day. They are making their product in Asia , because there is no handwork in there. So , they can make whatever they can't in the US. Most countries do that , even though a person can make his or her product by himself or herself. Because they just print where the product was made. However , people know advertising is a way to introduce to sell. So , people could decide either to buy it or not.

Should they attempt to understand the more important concepts and ideas or should they try to accumulate as much knowledge in facts as they can? Understanding ideas and concepts is enabling students to think in a certain way that is primordial for their success. Then, this large knowledge can be applied in different situations more specifically. Moreover understanding concepts and ideas is making it much easier for the students to learn related facts.

992,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"I agree with this statement because in my opinion successful people have more money to spend than normal people. They can try what they want, and in their opinion anything is forbidden. They want to try new experiences, learn new things and sometimes take risks. Last week I read in the newspaper that a famous Italian singer decided to spend a month in an unknown place ( probably an island). He wants to be alone. No  one can go with him. He doesn't have a personal phone because in this place the phone does not work in this way and he can not communicate. He wants to stay in contact with nature. To find food he can only fish or hunt. In my opinion it was a very dangerous experience but I think that the only reason that this singer decided to go is to increase his success. If he does not have the economic possibility I am sure that he will not go. I think that it is important to increase your knowledge, try new things but there are some limits that we must respect. It is good to do small things but better than doing more things not well.

993,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Successful people generally think very widely and try to see every face of a subject. This is a very effective way to solve the issues. The theory that successful people are likely to try and learn new things is true. Trying or learning new things leads the person to think widely and consequently, this person gains the skill of finding great solutions to the problems that the company faces. This essay indicates how learning or trying new things can improve the career of a person. First of all, trying new things can help people to think freely. It is obvious that the people who always prefer to do familiar things have similar ideas and one type of solution to every issue. In the high-budget companies, the managers generally hire workers to investigate their positive feelings about new subjects. The reason why trying new skills is important for business success is that the problems of the sectors have a great variety and the solutions should be found by thinking about every possibility. People who like to try new things are eligible for the business sector because they are open minded and also brave enough to change their habitats. Courage in that sector is very significant for the success of giving life to high risk solutions and with the experience of new things and enhancing the old habitat indicate the dimension of the courage of a person. The second point is that trying new things increases creativity. Moving to a new place is one part of it and as an evidence of this theory, the artists sometimes move to non-native countries to create and improve their artistic works. The variety of ideas leads to the success of the works. To sum up, trying new things is a significant requirement for success in working life. Though it seems that replacing an old thing is not easy, this change gives people the ability to think widely. Courage and creativity are two examples that a person can gain from the changes and use them in daily life.

They broke open many barriers that older generations of same age group lived in. The new ads on the TV would speak to the extent of support even from their parents do young people receive for participating in helping their communities. In this case, the ad begins showing a distressed young man sitting on a balcony watching the streets he lives in. He is shocked to see the state of living he is in, with roads filled with litter, nothing in place. He then gets shocked to see a little boy searching for food near a bin. This little boy awakens to the plight of situations that can be altered. He invites his friends not for an outing like any other weekend, but to clean up the streets, not waiting for help from the government. They also help the little boy with some food, and they raise donations to help the boy with education. Parents are shown not restricting the movements of the boys.

In particular, people who participate in the group travel have less experience of going abroad. They completely lack knowledge about this foreign country. A tour guide has a lot of experience and a lot of information about it. For example, in Asia, there are many dangerous areas which almost all residents keep away from. If you are taught by a tourist about this information, you will not face the dangerous situation. However, it is true that there are poor guides. Preventing you from hiring a bad tourist, you should choose a big company which provides good service. The second reason is that the tour guide can lead you to a good place where you can not be detected by yourself. In particular, on a short trip, you should go around some country in a hurry, and you do not have enough time to spare. In this point of view, the existence of a tour guide can reduce the waste of time. In addition, he can provide a lot of information which makes your trip more exciting.

Nobody can understand a theme just by learning simple facts, it is the complex idea that makes someone understand. Everybody can learn things off by hard, but not everyone understands the material. And the understanding for me makes a person grow not only its mind but also its personality. But still there are some benefits to both sides. When I had history classes in school for instance, I was always really good at understanding the ideas and concepts that were discussed, but always when I had to write an exam I had problems remembering important dates. And that is what the main point of history is, isn't it? The result was that I never got a better mark than a three. That is just the average mark in Germany. But when I started to study the dates which resemble the facts in the question. I suddenly got much better marks. On the other hand if I had just known the dates I would have gotten a much worse mark, because I probably wouldn't have understood any of the assignments. But I also think that there are cases where you just have to know simple facts. In some parts of biology, chemistry, physics and maths, in all science. I mean if you have to label body parts of an animal or human, there is no way in doing that without knowing the facts. An eye is an eye and not a leg, this is quite obvious.","[""I think both points are equally important in college but in your later life it would be more important to understand the arguments and basics than to learn the facts off by hard work.

For example, one american wine ad gives people the belief that wine made in America is very good compared with wine made in France or Chile.

We rely so much on the advertisements and bring the product to use. But, most of the advertisements make the products look much better than what they really are. I totally agree with this. I have heard lots from people about the superficial advertisements whose products are really bad and i have experienced it too. There are a lot of hair related products like shampoos, conditioners and hair styling products of different brands. I have dry and weak hair. I happened to see an ad for shampoo for dry and weak hair. There advertisement showed a model having silky and strong hair after using it. So relying on the advertisement i bought that shampoo and used it but to my surprise i didnt get even okay results. Basically they try to sell their products by making progandas about the product but actually it is not satisfying at all. Lets consider the example of fitness equipment. The advertisements show that if you use this product you will lose so many pounds, if you use that product you will lose some more pounds. Since in the US obesity is the major problem, people rely on these aids and bring home the instruments. They do lose some pounds but it is not the same pounds they show in advertisements. In most of the advertisements, they will just show beautiful models and celebrities to make their ad look fancier than it actually is. I want to tell one of my friends about my experience with cell phone service.","['Advertisements have become an important part of our daily life.

In my opinion students have to learn every thing practically so that they can remember for more time,lets take an example, lets take a lecture from a professor in a biology class,the professor is explaining about some subject related to frogs , in this case with out seeing the frog just having a figure on the blackboard and blindly following the textbook is not good, if you want to learn the subject perfectly then go to the biology lab and test a frog then know the facts by your own and then prepare your own notes, then see whether what you studied is correct or not. With out doing all these just by reading the textbook andsaying that ""I got understood"" is not at all a correct thing for students. We can learn facts by doing things practically and by conducting research. Students should be in a position of describing new ideas and new concepts but not in the position of mugging the old ideas and concepts. There is a lot of thrills in learning the facts, here is an example from my personal experience, last time I went to my friends' place which is some place near warangal (historical place in the Southeren part of India It is a very rural area even power supply is not there,the people there are uneducated ,there is a belief in that area that if any one goes at night time to a place called ""maranam""(a big tree with lots of caves) then they will be killed by an evil ,i felt strange when i heard this,that night me and my friends went there my friends were hiding near another tree and i'm standing nearer the tree, i waited for themThis is why learning facts will also give a thrill,and one important thing is learning new things will make.","['I disagree with the statement,i think students have to learn the facts inorder to understand the concept,with out learning the facts regarding how a student can read?

We can't imagine what our life would be like if people like Leonardo da Vinci,Volta,Newton, Einstein and a lot of other people like them never tried to find something different from what they already knew.

In 2020 we hope that the expectations of life will become higher,and it will be only for medicine and doctors who are searching for new medicines. Also in the personal financial sense, taking risks is very important,because if you do what you already know how to do,probably like other peaple,you can earn enough money to live,but you will never be rich. for example,if Bill Gates never tried to find a new way to use the computer,now he couldn't be who he is,and also all the people who use the computer have to say thanks to him.

On the other hand, some people enjoy the afraid feeling and the risks. Many times, some people, who try something not familiar, could be successful, fortunately. In my opinion, trying new things is effective and essential to make one's life and others' lives successful. The first reason why I think trying something new is right is that it needs to be brave. Even though there are a lot of damage and risks as you try a new thing, the difficulties probably can give chances to your life. Bravery is one of the most important factors in order to not only be successful but also live with confidence. In that, trying something new means the person is very brave, which needs to be self-esteem oneself. I believe someone, who loves himself , can enjoy his or her life. In addition, trying something new gives more opportunities. If you do what you already know how to do well, you will probably not fail. However, you cannot succeed as much as you want, because the ordinary thing is for everyone. The new things are the only way to get more opportunities. For example, Bill Gates is the richest person in the world. However, at first, his company was not that wealthy to make him the wealthiest person on Earth, because the ""computer business"" was not famous, then. Fortunately, Gates challenges into the new field, and he achieves his goals and helps other humans to enjoy computers. Finally, trying new things makes the world improve. When people who try new things achieve success, it means the world becomes more comfortable.","['Many people are afraid when they try something new.

However, if he or she does not try, there is no possibility of having a successful life at the beginning. The important things that people should try first.

1025,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities or not. some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their communities. However, I firmly believe that helping their communities is quite an important thing in their life. First of all, We can not live by ourselves. we have to help each other. of course that is an option and we can choose whatever we want, but nowadays, It would be harder and harder if people tried to live bythemselves. If we try to spend our time in communities, It can be a good way to get to know many people who can help us when we get into a hard time. For example, I was trying to have my own piano recitle in my communites. and I heard that is not so easy. but fortunately I was a volunteer in my community last summer and through that experience, I had a chance to get to know lots of people who could help me. so I could have a report very easily because of their recommendations. Secondly, we can improve our social skills. nowadays, people tend to be isolated. but I dont think that is the best way to live. For example, I have a friend and she always tries to be alone in her room.","['It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities or not. some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their communities.

1026,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"Infact yes. Young people enjoy their lives more than they will do years later. I would attribute this phenomenon mainly to maturity that creaps in with age. Young people are often more carefree and always get a sound sleep. Having lived disciplined lives as children in the family, they get adventurous and naughty in their rearing adolescence. Also, companionship at a young age is too emotional. Relationships break and then again make trivial issues. They have not seen hardships of life and are capable of taking on larger risks. In their quest to find out what life is all about, they get new experiences. In my view, Learning new things is the biggest fun. Young people enjoy the thrill of life even when they lose something because every defeat opens up new avenues for them just like every victory does. Its their zeal and vigour that differentiates them from the older people. In contrast older people are like a peaceful river nearing the sea. Their lives may be very happy but the bubbliness of a young child is not there. They have serious responsibilities on their shoulders. A lonely young person is well off compared to an old person.

1033,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"I would like to answer this question by introducing what that means: enjoy life. Whether people enjoy their lives or not depends on many things. Firstly, it could depend on your hobbies, like playing basketball or fishing. Both are completely different and you might say that fishing is more suitable for older people whereas basketball is more suitable for younger people. Secondly, it depends on your social circumstances. This means some people enjoy spending time with their family. Others like to go to parties whenever possible. This can also be related to age. Additionally it could depend on the education. Higher educated people maybe would like to visit an opera rather than hanging around in a bar. Today a lot of people think education was much better in former times. Nevertheless I believe younger people enjoy life more for several reasons (but this answer is somehow biased, because I think I am young). All the reasons mentioned above cannot lead to an adequate answer from my point of view, because those are personal things. Younger people enjoy life more, because they have less responsibilities. So younger people have more space to be spontaneous than older people have. Furthermore younger people are on average healthier, which gives them the possibility of doing more things in a shorter period of time. In addition there is a lot of stuff to discover, which older people may have discovered already. The advantage of older people is that they usually have more money for enjoying life, but I believe that is caused by today's globalization it is less important. Everything becomes cheaper and money is not required for enjoying life.","[""I would like to answer this question by introducing what that means: enjoy life.

On the other hand facts are necessary to know the consequences of the action of someone who decided to follow his ideas. Having to make a choice I think that the keyword is the verb understand.

1037,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Some people claim that successful people only work hard, while others like me fully agree that success depends on trying and searching. The first point i would like to make is that there are strong advantages to working in the same way. One benefit of working in the same way is not becoming any risks. You won`t fall down. For instance, my father who is a mechanical mechanical engineer. He worked 30 years for one company so he had enough money and promotions.

For example, the computational fluid dynamics activity needs real mathematics and fluid physics knowledge so a person can then think about a revolutionary concept. By focusing on one point, we can try different methods to bypass it. Working on something wellknown helps thinking about the major issue and not about mathematics 'properties.

1052,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three advantages. First, as you travel in a group led by a tour guide, the tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see on the journey. For example, if you want to go sightseeing, a tour guide will escort you to the sight. The tour guide will be responsible for whatever traveler wants to do. They just don' t have to worry about reserving a restaurant or doing some special activities. Especially when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoken in the country where they travel to. Second, since going travelling with a group, they will definitely get along with each other and have fun. If traveling alone, you won't be able to have much fun as traveling with a group. Third, traveling on a gourp with a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone.

Ever since transportation has developed amagingly, the world is getting closer.","[""I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three advantages. First, as you travel in a group led by a tour guide, the tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see on the journey. For example, if you want to go sightseeing, a tour guide will escort you to the sight. The tour guide will be responsible for whatever traveler wants to do. They just don' t have to worry about reserving a restaurant or doing some special activities. Especially when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoken in the country where they travel to. Second, since going travelling with a group, they will definitely get along with each other and have fun. If traveling alone, you won't be able to have much fun as traveling with a group. Third, traveling on a gourp with a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone.

1073,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"When you have a mastercard in the dessert will it be useful for you while you want water to survive? This is the way ideas and concepts work. In real life, you will act naturally as you are and as you know without refering to the math or the physics. You will drink water without thinking that it is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. So, learning the facts is more important than understanding the concepts because in real life you will use the facts more easily,and you can do it naturally without wasting time thinking while there is no time. First of all, in our life when we face something we cope with it more easily with facts which includes an experience from father or brother or even from TV. However, when you want to do something you will not bring your calculator and your pen and think about it. For example, when you sit with your grandmother you know you just want someone to sit with her and hear her talking about boring things, but as you don't show that you are not bored, your grandmother will love you more. Second, we act like humans, and this doesn't mean that we don't use our minds. When you have a puncture you will raise your foot and try to control the car.","[""When you have a mastercard in the dessert will it be useful for you while you want water to survive?

1092,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"The tendency of the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"" is right. I think so because I am a person who acts risky and I have always had success. But before you generalize you have to know what risk means in this context. Risk according to your career is to be brave to live and work or study in a foreign country for longer than 3 months. Risk in terms of success in my opinion is to apply for another job even though you are happy and safe right now with your situation. My risk started after I finished my internship at Neuss County Council as an IT-Specialist. Working for a government facility is quite secure. The chance that you will lose your job is low. But I have thought that this cannot be everything in my life. I wanted to apply for a job in a call center because I thought that talking to people might help my problem of communication. I applied for the best call center in my region and I worked for Microsoft. Even now I am writing my thesis to graduate at Microsoft Germany. I also worked and studied one semester in the United States. The time scale here is approximately 10 months. My exchange semester in South Korea and my internship at the Korean German Chamber of Commerce and Industry were also great experiences. If I review my journey right now and compare it to some friends who never left the city where we graduated high school I can definitely say that I have an advanced status. The reason for this conclusion is because this friend of mine applied for the same internship program. So the arguments are not only my thoughts but my experience. Additionally, my friend had to admit that I always have something to talk about. And we figured out that the more information you get the more opportunities you can turn into successful projects. Right now I am preparing to build up my own business because I have contacts worldwide.

In the following , I give my own opinions about the topic. Obviously, it is a hard question to speak. In my opinion,it all depends. Yonug people are always energetic. Enjoying life for them is doing playing. They can do amazing cool things that the older can not take,such as playing tense games ,travelling to many beautiful places away from hometown. In short, they have the ability to take part in physical working things ,which is not available to the elderly. Now , whether the older is not enjoying life? The key makes sure that is wrong. Compared with young people's energy, the older would not have any advantages. Though thus,fortunately,there is one thing that the young must not have :the memory. In the older 's childhoods, lacking modern instruments,there were no computers,no colorful tv sets,no abundant money to live a good life,even no money to live. All that they experienced was rather uneasy. It must be the most important memory in their whole life.

1115,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"actually if we dont have an idea or concept about anything then we cannot understand that. but what is meant by ideas? the idea is that having general information about that topic and what the concept is is knowing about that area or particular task. in my opinion having to have ideas and concepts is better than learning the facts. because if we dont even have the idea about that topic then how can we have the concept and if we dont have that to then learning facts is also a waste of time and it is unnecessary time waste. for example if i dont have any idea about how to use a computer and do n't even know anything about it then if i start learning about it it is a waste and if i learn also i will not remember those facts for longer. i can remember for a shorter time but that doesnt really help me. i before learning any facts first of all i will get an idea about that topic and then i will try to have little concept about it and then learn facts so that it will be helpful for me. once i had a subject named daa and i did nt even know that subject. I also had an idea but i did nt have the concept. my professor for that subject was really too bad, so when it was time for the exam i had to study that subject, i really remember that it was the most really tough time i have ever gone through in my life.","[""actually if we dont have an idea or concept about anything then we cannot understand that. but what is meant by ideas? the idea is that having general information about that topic and what the concept is is knowing about that area or particular task. in my opinion having to have ideas and concepts is better than learning the facts. because if we dont even have the idea about that topic then how can we have the concept and if we dont have that to then learning facts is also a waste of time and it is unnecessary time waste. for example if i dont have any idea about how to use a computer and do n't even know anything about it then if i start learning about it it is a waste and if i learn also i will not remember those facts for longer. i can remember for a shorter time but that doesnt really help me. i before learning any facts first of all i will get an idea about that topic and then i will try to have little concept about it and then learn facts so that it will be helpful for me. once i had a subject named daa and i did nt even know that subject.

1118,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I totally agree with this statement. Firstly, travelling in groups led by a tour guide is convenient. leading by a tour guide, you may not have to worry about the issues during the trip. For example, you don't need to think about which hotel you should choose to stay in, where you have a meal, and which cars or trains you should take. Every thing is arranged well by the tour guide. The only thing you need to do is to follow the group, see beautiful sights and enjoy them fully. Also, you can get a lot of knowledge and insight from the presentation of a tour guide. Tour guides are given good training or education in how to introduce the information about sight to tourists. In this sense, they are professional people who are most familiar with the information of sight. Having an introduction from the tour guide, I believe all of you will get comprehensive knowledge without any efforts. However, when you take a lonely trip, no one provides this kind of service and you may miss the best chance to learn about the world. Moreover, there are often many people in a travel group. I am a sociable person and I like to do many things with other people. I hate loneliness.","[""I totally agree with this statement.

Once upon a time, everyone knew all the members of their town, and there was not anyone who did not know anyone in their town, because they always cared about their neighborhoods. However the apartment does not give them any chance to meet their neighbours. One more, the jobs are getting more professional. Everyone engages in different parts of jobs. So they do not have a chance to think about their neighbourhoods and communities. So the reasons i think are studying, apartment and professionalizing of jobs. First of all, studying culture makes students not help their communities. In highschool, all the students compete with eachother so badly, they do not have anytime to think abouttheir communities. They will have to go to academies after school, and they will be so tired. After the academies, they will fall asleep right after arriving at home. This culture makes this society like that. Second, living in apartments is one of the reasons. Apartment is a separate place. All the people do not care about their neighbors and do not know who their neighbours are. The apartments are getting so big, and they will not remember who the neighbors  are.","['I agree with the statement. In Korea, all high school students work only on studying.

It is important, in my humble opinion, to understand the background of every event, and, at the same time, have the ability to collocate it in the line of time. Once you have recorded a date, you can rebuild in your memory the historical background. This is the function of a 'by hearth learning'.

But after some time these are replaced by other means of transportation. modern man invented aeroplanes with his great intensive knowledge. I think these plans replace the use of cars in the future generations. Because day by day technology is also improving to meet the greatest advanced things in modern life. With the help of technology man invented different things like computers and smartphones and airoplan to savetime. as well as improve the standards of living.

Nowadays, cars have become a demand to improve the quality of life and save time and maintain the dignity of everyone who uses the cars.

I think these plans replace the use of cars in the future generations. Because day by day technology is also improving to meet the greatest advanced things in modern life.

1129,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"A New Thing Gives Success Many people believe that if a person wants to be successful, he/she should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I agree with this. Although there are many different definitions of the term ""successful people"", I believe that if a person does not try new things, he/she will never be successful. There are many successful people as examples for this statement, such as Albert Einstein and Bill Gates. Albert Einstein is one of the most famous and revolutionary physicists in history. What he did was use his radial thought on the situation with speed of light to contrast with Sir Isaac Newton's theory, which is called classical physics and contains the most basic theories on forces at that time. With this contrast, Albert Einstein established new physical theories. By taking a try on new thoughts, Enstein had physical subjects step forward to new generations, and himself became a successful person. He has said: "" Innovation is more important than knowledge. ""As he said, without this creative thought, physics would never have progress. Another successful person I want to show here is one of the richest people in the current world, whose name is Bill Gates. He is the CEO of the biggest software company, Microsoft. With his great sense of the development of computers, he really passes a gate toward bill.","['A New Thing Gives Success Many people believe that if a person wants to be successful, he/she should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

Frankly speaking,what people with a guide can understand is only the surface of the country. I think feeling and knowing the different ways or values is the most interesting thing about travelling. And it can be achieved only by voluntary actions. In that meaning,not all but many travelers with tour guides miss the chance to enjoy the travel. First,generally the trip with a tour guide is easier to get information or knowledge of the country you are going to. You don't either have to buy a guide book nor collect the information from the internet before you leave. Even though you haven't done those things,the tour guide will tell you all you want to know,such as good restaurants, exciting amusement park or beautiful scenery. Without a tour guide you have to do all of these things by yourself,so you can get a good understanding through this action. Second,feeling and knowing different ways can be achieved by knowing the native people. But there are less chances to get along with them by tour trip. There is less free time on the tour because the guide is scheduled most of the time.

Some people believe that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, whereas others oppose this opinion and support that there will be more cars than today. The latter position is certainly the stronger of the two and would be expected in detail. First and foremost, the poor countries will develop themselves. For instance, they will create roads, will sophicate themselves. Because the population will earn more money and the development of these countries, the population will use cars. For example I went to marocco and it is really amazing to see how the development of the country has influenced the number of cars in the country.

But, a new oil was discovered and will be less powerful than the older. Two days ago, the french government announced that we will use it soon and that it will be less expensive than the older one. So it will be very good because you will not be a real danger to nature and you will spend less money by driving.

On the other hand, some people think that technology is going to develop and the use of cars is going to decrease in the coming years. This might be true.

Secondly, Advertisements introduce products without putting their pejorative qualities into perspective. For instance if you buy a microwave oven, you cannot nuke something near the baby or radiation sensitive people.","["",\tIt is the reality on one can the reality.

1143,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"There are some reasons to agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First, tour guides have knowledge of the travel place. A tour guide can introduce important parts of a place and important objects. For example, Our family went to New york, in 2004. At that time, we didn't have a tour guide. The first time, we feel ok. When we leave that country, we don't have some knowledge of that country. We feel very bad. But tour guides cover this kind of thing. Secondly, tour guides give safety. Other countries have different people, different society and different places. If we have no tour guide, we can get lost or become dangerous from other people. For example, I see an article in a newspaper. That article's story is dangerous for sole travel. In that article there are two students. Two students enjoy their trip. But on the last day, one student goes to some place. That student lost the way. Suddenly, a gangster kidnaps that student. People can't find that student. Two months later, that student's parents find that student in another city. That student seats some place. That student looks like a bulge. When a parent finds a student, that student has no legs and arms.","[""There are some reasons to agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

In Italy, for example, there doesn't exist this attitude and this education for all or about all. But according to me in the near future we, humans, will arrive at the point that we will have to constrict to use public transport even if we don't want or other services will be invented to permit us to move without acar.

1156,"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.","I think that the statement will probably not reflect the real vision of the future. In twenty years there will be hopefully more cars than today. Cars represent a material good which everyone in modern society must have in order to keep up with the world outside. Whatever you do, you need a car. Wherever you go, you need a car. It's definitely a must. That's why i believe the number of cars will increase in the future. Also, long distances are now an everyday part of life. Most of today's jobs usually require a car in order to get around, to go anywhere. In fact it is so common now to move from city to city for work, and many people find it easier to move by car, since the bad service of trains or planes often end up being annoying and stressing. In fact, when you have to catch a train , It often happens that the train is delayed. the same happens with planes. So you find yourselves waiting for hours at the train station or at the airport, telling yourself "" I should have used my car! "". That's one of the reasons I do believe people would rather use their car than take public transportation. Therefore, if people need to use the car, whoever doesn't own one, will need to buy one, and that will increase the number of cars. Besides, I believe that we should also consider the young people in order to forsee that the numbers of cars will definitely increase in the next few years. In fact we have to take into account how important kids are withinsociety. They represent the customers of the future. They will also be the cars' buyers of the future. Young kids can't wait to turn eighteen years old only to get their driver'slicence. They look forward to having their own car, because they want to feel independent, free, they want to turn into adults finally. One of the feelings to feel like a grown up man or woman is driving your car. your own car represents a piece of the world of yours.

1157,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.,"With the increase in instant communication, advertisements have become much more popular. And nowadays most of the adverts are shown on TVs. These advertisements include from very useful products to the products that cause regretful days for customers. There are so many situations we are encountering today. How many of us rushed to a market to buy a very simple product that pulled us like a magnet? It can be a pen or a HI-FI. It doesn't matter. But there are many other products that do the same job as the advertised materials. And also, they can be much cheaper than the advertised one. But it doesn't matter. Once we are hypnotised by the advertisement on a TV channel, no one can make us buy the other crappy thing, or it seems like a crappy thing. So many feedbacks are given by customers till today about lots of unsatisfactory things. And what is more; these can be a material that was being advertised over the media. I also encountered such problems. Once I brought back a bad book that became very interesting to me with an advertisement before I bought it over the Internet. This was because of that shiny advertisement. If I had seen the book in a store before, I would never even touch its cover with my precious fingers. It was just a game played over those easily affected customers who watch advertisements, like me. Also, there are so many movies that we wanted to see so much and jumped into the cinema saloon and ran away at an incredible speed after the credits. There are even lots of people who rush to the exit door of the saloon during the movie breaks and never come back who can't resist. But as you think; these movies had been advertised so successfully before the watchers spent their hard earned money. In conclusion, it is possible to show a product much better than they really are with an advertisement.

1158,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"What are the most important things we have to learn at school or at university? That is the question. Is the most important thing to have a good understanding of the main concepts or ideas? Or is it to learn a lot of information, without having a good comprehension of the main concepts? According to me, the main character for a good student at the end of school is a good comprehension and an ability for reproducing the concepts. In your argumentation, we will present some elements in order to give our own opinion. First, I think it's very important for a student to be able to reproduce the main ways of a reflexion. For example, concerning a mathematical exercise, a student will be judged about his ability to do the problem again with different information. So that's more important, it is'nt the basic information but the way of reflection. It's generally the same for every scientific topic. To my mind, it's better to understand the general ideas until of the general facts. Secondly, I believe for general facts like the history facts, students have all the time to learn them in their free time. For example, I don't think a little boy, if he doesn't know the name of the current President, will be a bad student.","[""What are the most important things we have to learn at school or at university?

1160,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"When I read this statement, I automatically think that it is right, young people enjoy life more than older people do. But if I think about it, it appears to be, in fact, the contrary. It is true that young people have discovered everything. When one is born, one has to learn and to build all of who one wants to be. Therefore, a young person has to try and to search for all that he can, to know who he is. In that sense, he enjoys life more than older people, who already know who they are. It is also true that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life than older people. The education system permits them to meet many different people, until the entrance to professional life : the student has to change his educational place all his student life, with the school, the high school, the college, etc. At the contrary, older people already have a durable placement in their company, and therefore have fewer occasions to meet other people. Finally, we know that young people do sports and have activities that older people can not exercise. That is the first impression that I had when I read the statement. But I am young and that is why my spirit only saw advantages for young people. If I am objective, it is obvious that older people also enjoy life. They have their life already lined up, that is true, but all the examples of adults around me show me that it is not a reason for us to stop their hobbies and to stay at home without doing anything to enjoy their life. My father, for instance, decided to quit my mother because he found his life too calm. He has many friends, and now he profits from everything more than, even if I am younger. With the world of today, and globalization, we can have only one job for our entire life, that is why older people have the opportunity to change their lives, to discover other things and other fields.","['When I read this statement, I automatically think that it is right, young people enjoy life more than older people do.

Therefore the tendency is to limit the negative impact of our state of life on the environment including cars. The aim of this essay will be to discuss the evolution of car numbers for the next 30 years. Manufacturing a car involves many different industries like steel, aluminium, flat glass and plastic production. Those massive industries play an important part in the economy of a country. Then, the decrease in production of cars will have an important impact on it until new orientations are made. Furthermore, many cars work with fuel, which leads to the economy of many countries too. It must be said that cars using alternative energy are emerging but as petrol will lead the market, producers will not have sufficient help and consideration. In addition to that, east countries like India and China faced an important economic development. The demand for cars will be very high for the next few years. Therefore I do,n't think that the level of cars will decrease. The solution is more to change the minds of drivers : they use cars too often : a money solution like driver's tax entreing a city like in london sociological orientation better use of common transport bus Change in the process of car consumption and so were one of the most popular in the economy of the country In some countries, statistics have shown that there are more cars than people.

1164,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"It`s quite common to hear judgments about young people nowadays. It`s even quite popular to think that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someone else'slife. Well, I think It`s the way adults usually use to solve some of their internal problems, completely not tied to what the reality is. The reality is that young people nowadays spend much more time helping their community than before, and I think these habits will increase in the future. Modern life has brought us to stress our time in order to do as much as we can: or better, in order to earn as much as we can. This behaviour entails an important aspect: the rising of a new concept of common culture. What I want to say is that now every young person is sufficiently prepared to understand that it is better to work and to make efforts for the community instead of behaving selfishly. Any good action can only improve the common happiness, but our happiness is just inside this commonwealth. It`s even more and more evident how young people are trying to destroy old stereotypes of thinking about what is different. Although until a few years ago hostile behaviour among human races was deeply radiated in common thinking, new social dynamics are strongly addressing young people to accept every kind of difference. Thus making it easier and faster the growing of a new common sense of belonging to a community; and it ` s this new sense of belonging to make us spend more time with this new family. Anyway the increase in the number of young people involved in volunteer groups , such as medical teams in poor areas of the world or even very young people helping elderly people , is a confirmation of what I ` vestated. In conclusion, I can even well understand why many adults think that most young people are poor in spirit : are not they to teach us in university classes that the only god we must pray to is money? And the only way to earn money isn`t time?.","[""It`s quite common to hear judgments about young people nowadays.

1166,Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.,"Success is a very common word that people use very frequently to express their ambitions. It is probably the best goal someone may have and it can be reached in every field, but how? The main element needed to have success is studying. Studying will always bring somewhere better than where you are now and this is another great goal to which you should always aim at in your life. Another fundamental factor is risk. Risk is not a very common word, because when it is used, it usually represents a very difficult and intense situation. Apart from businessmen, people don't like this word very much. As a matter of fact, it is mainly used in business discussions. In economics, risk is what leads to success. For instance in stock exchanges, no one who hasn't ever risked is successful, and never will be. In business, you are compelled to gamble on tons and tons of factors that will determine the way through of your day and consequently of your life earnings.

1167,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Although it's important to learn ideas and concepts in textbooks, I disagree with the statements that it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the ideas and concepts are originated from facts.

For my part, I think there will be fewer care in the twenty years than there is today for many reasons. First I think that the sources of energy will decrease, especially oil. So it will be hard to provide oil for cars. Now the oil price is over 70$. ! Unless they discover new sources of energy. In addition to prices of oil will get higher and higher. People will have problems getting gas for their cars. Second thing, the population of the world will increase. So it will be hard to drive because of traffic, and it will take a long time to move from one place to another. As most studies stated, and as many people immigrating from poor countries to the developed ones. Third, discovering new means of transportation such as subways, or express trains will be a good reason that people will leave cars. Because they are cheaper, faster, and safer.

There are many churches, cultural monuments, and famous concert halls to visit. I could not choose where to go first or where I definitely should go. However, when I travel with a group and a tour guide, the tour guide planned everything and scheduled everything efficiently. I do not have to waste time making decisions, and also I never miss famous places to visit. Sometimes it is hard to find a restaurant when I travel by myself.

When I was a student and travelling to Italy, I was a backpacker.

Let's take as an example Alexander Graham Bell, when he invented the telephone, he made lots of different adjustments some work some didn't.

People usually take it for granted that the conception of young means having fun, which is why our society provides more facilities for young people to do so. For example, the manufacturers produce various toys for babies, children, and even young adults. More over, many topics on TV concern the young, seldomly with the old. When I turn on my TV, I can find a lot of children's channels as interesting as Disney. In some countries, like China, there is only one child in a family. So both parents and grandparents will love her or him as precious as an apple, and provide her or him with all kinds of opportunities to have fun. Additionally, young people have a lot of energy and fewer responsibilities, which makes it easier for them to have fun. On the other hand, the old have to earn money in order to sustain the family. For instance, my father always looks tired after he comes home from his office and then he even refuses himself to have fun with me, which makes me very upset. As a wise man said (and I paraphrase ), "" Time is money, and time is treasure"". These words make those adults and olds think that they can not waste their time having fun at all, which might not be totally correct. Admittedly, our society provides old people with more and more opportunities and encourages them to have fun, especially when they get retired. After retiring, more and more old people feel bored and lonely at home. So they try to make more and more opportunities for themselves to have fun. The city government usually organize Senior Clubs which includes gym facilities, dance center, and so on.

People who succeed in business usually try new things and take risks. To begin with, only new ideas can succeed. An old idea wouldn't make you rich or popular. only new ideas do. people are usually interested in new things because they think it is cool or trendy. For example, many people bought new types of video game like the Wii or Playstation3 in Japan. Some people bought these games on impulse because the news programs or TV showed a great system about them and made you buy them. Now,how about old type of videogames? Will you buy it? The answer is no even TV suggested it because you already know what the problem with these old games is and you can find out that TV's information is not always correct. Another reason is that risky decisions will be worth a lot. Many rich people try very hard to become rich. In another ward, they took many risks to aim for their goals. So risks and success are related. If you take risks, you might fail. However, you might do well. When the risks that you took are greater, the prize is also great. That's why people who didn't take risks wouldn't have success. It is similar to gambling. For example, my uncle went to the casino last year.

As far as I am concerned,I would say that giving time to other people, or being investigated in an activity requires a lot of human qualityand a strong engagement. It might not be easy to help our community when you have responsibility at work, at home, with children. In order to manage a good way of living we have to make choices at any time during our own life. Secondly , we can consider the problem from a different point of view. If you are living in a huge town it will be more difficult to help the community than living in the country. Thanks to their small village in the country,everybody knows everybody. The fact of the densification of the population,it's easier and faster to link and create central meetings. Obviously, the democracy will grow up with the help of younger people. I don't really agree with the fact that young people do not give enough time to the community. For example, sometimes in your jobs ,the director asks you for high responsibilities, even if you didn't choose them you have to control and help your company.

Second, Give the customers enough information about the product in a short time. Third, there are many competitions in the same kind of product.

Secondly, older people have money and time to enjoy life. young people need money and their pocket money is not enough for some activities. however, when a person has a job and he is paid well, he can do what he wants in his holidays and free time. for example, even if two people enjoy reading books, one who is younger can't buy a book that he wants, the other can buy all of the books the writer has written. also, younger people can't find free time to do it. for instance, i like watching films and i know it is a simple activity. however i can't do it everytime because my school is very hard. also i live in a big city and i don't have a car so my time is spent on the buses.","[""many people have a different point of view about the idea of enjoying life. some think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. in contrast to this some think that older people have become knowledgeable about life and so they can enjoy it more than young people. i personally agree with the second idea because i think that young people have more important problems than old people, so they can't enjoy life as much as old people.

If any one has some responsibility they may not enjoy it like less responsibility people. I observed some points in my friends. Some of my friends do not have any restrictions or responsibility. They enjoy a lot of everyday life. It is not possible for older people because mostly they have some responses during old age. Like their children's education on other financial problems. But these young people dont have such types of problems. And some more reasons for this are health problems. Young people are more active than older people or not. Young people can enjoy themselves without taking any rest for so many hours. Where as olders cannot do this. A better example of this is every weekend i prefer to go to some pubs in my city. I can find a lot of youngsters and olders. I observed that young people dance till late at night. But it is highly difficult for older people.

It says that some people could lose 5 kg in two weeks or less than a week. Many people bought it and some of them had really terrible results.

1230,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Towards the statement that ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"", I would say that I agree with this statement. There are several reasons to support my belief. Firstly, specializing in only one specific subject would make a person become abstract. Concentrating on training students in one specific subject may have a harmful effect on children's development. If children receive specialized training in their studies, it may be too early for them to decide what to learn for their future. A student may choose to study biology in Grade 7, for example, because he likes animals. When he grows up, he may find that the subject is completely different from what he expects and it will be too late for him to switch to another subject. Career prospects are the second issue that I consider. Though having deep knowledge in one specific subject would let people become experts, society only requires a small portion of such kinds of experts, where college professors are the examples. Instead, having a variety of academic knowledge provides people with diverse potential job positions to select from. For example, a person who studies history may only be able to work in a museum.","['Towards the statement that ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"", I would say that I agree with this statement.

1233,Young people enjoy life more than older people do.,"The reason that the younger generation seem to enjoy life more than the older generation is that they seem to have a greater ability to make what they desire come true. this could be because of the greater energy levels that the younger generation has when compared to the Old. The second reason is the flexible attitude that the young can take. they are easily adaptable to the situation and change accordingly and make the most of things, but on the contrary the old are not that flexible. they do not want to change from the normal routine work that they try to. they are very much used to the old work that they always do and thus they miss enjoying other works which they can. For example a group of young people when they are out would always like to try out new things which they have never before done but old people always end up doing things that they have always been doing. but on the contrary enjoyment would mean differently to different people. The old grandpa of two children would find great pleasure in telling a story to his little grandchildren.","['The reason that the younger generation seem to enjoy life more than the older generation is that they seem to have a greater ability to make what they desire come true. this could be because of the greater energy levels that the younger generation has when compared to the Old.

1244,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"The ""understand"" function is an asset when it comes to learning something.

Moreover, I spent about two hours looking for an information center. If I had a tour guide, I would have a wonderful vacation in Australia visiting many fun places , instead of wasting time on the road. Secondly, people can understand and the country easily. Although, people traveling without a tour guide can also understand the culture and country, however, I believe it is more beneficial to have a tour guide. When my mother and father traveled to New Zealand, they found so many interesting things there, because the guide translated all the information that they visited and also, telling a story that is relevant to the event or history. Therefore my parents could understand the culture and also some traditional stories with out difficulties. Thus, people, like my parents who can not speak the language that they are visiting, can also learn about the country with out any trouble. In conclusion, for these reasons that I have mentioned above, even though, traveling around the country with a tour guide might be more memorable and more fun, I think however leading a guide more advantageous to me.

Firstly, if they want to continue to be successful, they have to try new things and take risks. In the business scene, successful investors try to look for something new. They always try to do something different from normal. Because only doing something normal cannot lead to making money. By searching for different ways, they can have more possibilities to encounter better ways and unique ideas. By doing the same things as others, normally it doesn't make profits.

1250,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of convenience and obtaining information by tour guide. Both ways of this argument have advantages. However I would side with that the best way to travel is alone without a tour guide because of the free and beneficial experience. Now then I will present this opinion by considering these two advantages. On the one hand, traveling with a group led by a tour guide might be said to bring advantages. On top of that if people travel with their guide they enjoy their tour conveniently. In other words the schedule is already set so people just travel without thinking such as where I am and then and so on. In addition the tour guide gives the tour information whenever people travel there. when I was in high school I travelled in America led by a tour guide the tour guide makes my family feel convenient. On the other hand,. Travelling alone without a tour guide would give many advantages. Firstly, if people travel alone they enjoy freedom and without inference and they can wander anywhere that they want. If the opportunity to travel is given to me I want to travel to the swiss that I want to go to. Secondly, travelling alone is a good choice by experience directly. In other words this is useful for social relationships and social experience. So traveling is very good.","['Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of convenience and obtaining information by tour guide.

1257,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"Many people think that the more you go to school the more you will be able to understand the world. They think that going to university makes you become an open-minded person. At university you learn theory - ideas and concepts - but what will theory be useful for you if you haven't any practice - facts? For example, I am a civil engineering student and at school I'm learning about the science of structures or how to calculate the rate of steel you have to put in concrete to make a good prestressed concrete? The theory looks pretty good. However in fact when you are on a site, working all that theory is not helpful. It's only the experience that will give you a good rate of steel. Even if I think that understanding the concept of prestressed concrete is very important, only the facts will show you how to be a good civil engineer. To illustrate, I will give my example. Last summer I did a training course in a house building company. Even if I had studied civil engineering for one year, I was unable to give orders to plumbers or electricians or other handworkers because I didn't know in fact, in reality, on the site, how they could execute the plans. I think that concepts and facts must be taught together. You have to understand the concepts and to know what they are related to in the real world. It's important to always be connected to reality. An idea without its application can be misunderstood. Speaking of AIDS without speaking of the real dangers in all countries, without speaking of Africa's problems could make a student think that it can't happen to him, that it is a rare disease, that he's not concerned.","[""Many people think that the more you go to school the more you will be able to understand the world.

There are some reasons why students should learn and understand ideas and concepts before learning facts and that they need to have a solid mental background as a basis. First, learning facts without understanding ideas and concepts is the same as making a sand castle. For example, if they use a machine or instrument for any reason without knowing the mechanism or concept, they can copy some work but they can't do creative work. Or when they encounter some problems, they can't solve anything and have to depend on other people who know the mechanism. Second, they won't be creative. They don't need to start from scratch for everything. However, once they know some concepts, they can manipulate and apply many things as they want and develop the current stage of work or improve it to make it productive. The third reason is making a good habit when they learn ideas and concepts. People who like to learn facts are usually lazy or superficial.","[""I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

1264,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"Developing a broad knowledge base on numerous academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject implies acquiring knowledge for the purpose of striving for quantity rather than quality. In my opinion, broad knowledge complements or rather acts as a foundation of specialization rather than being more favourable than specializing in one specific subject. Broad knowledge of many academic subjects has been emphasized during our early years of education since it provides students with a basis or tool to raise awareness of things occurring around them and a backbone to further develop their knowledge database. It also acts as an appetizer for people to explore different areas of knowledge and discover one that they are willing to dwell deeper into. In addition, it secures a certain level of literacy among the population since people have sufficient knowledge to handle daily matters. However, knowledge is about gaining in depth rather than having a broad yet shallow base. Broad knowledge is similar to information which is easily lost and can hardly be sustained. It is by specialization in one specific subject that knowledge can be thoroughly researched, experimented, evolutioned and make a difference to the world we live in. Civilizations take huge strides forward due to the innovation of pioneers who are specialists in their respective subjects. Multinational pharmaceutical companies invest billions in research and development to sponsor laboratory experiments in developing new medicines that can treat diseases such as AIDS and malaria.","['Developing a broad knowledge base on numerous academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject implies acquiring knowledge for the purpose of striving for quantity rather than quality.

1281,Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.,"I do not agree with the assertion because there are more opportunities nowadays for young people to help their communities. With the advent of the Internet or other media, people have become easier to get information that their community needs them to help. For example, in my apartment, the members of the committee announce the advertisement on our community website when they need people to help set up a certain event. And they often receive a lot of responses that say they would like to help. Compared to the past, there are few people informed that they need to help something. Thus, I think more and more young people are involved in community activities because they are more familiar with the internet than the people before, and understand they are in demand. In addition, in my school, university always encourage students to do something that can benefit our community or society. For example, they are encouraged to clean the streets and help teach older people who are illiterate to read. Universities do not pay the students that do service for the community.","['I do not agree with the assertion because there are more opportunities nowadays for young people to help their communities.

I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I believe that older people like life more than young people do for many reasons. First of all, old people enjoy life more than younger people do because they know they are very close to death. They know very well the meaning of death and they will die at anytime. For this reason, they try to spend their rest of their lives very effectively. On the other hand, young people feel that they never die and because of this, they are n't aware of the value of life. Additionally, old people like life more than younger people because they have many reasons to enjoy life. For example, they generally have children and a wife. They need to care about them. They enjoy life because of her family. On the other hand, young people do not have a daughter or son. They are single. Because they do not have any concrete reason to glue life, they do not enjoy life more than older people. Finally, I think old people enjoy life more than younger people because their expectations of life are not generally big. They generally expect a quiet place in peace with their family. This is enough for them to enjoy life. On the other hand, as I am a young man, I have many expectations from life and if I don't obtain any of them, I will easily hate life and I will be depressed. I expect a good job, a lot of money, a brand new car.","[""The issue at hand is whether young people enjoy life more than older people do or not.

1286,It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.,"In most cases academic education provides the possibility of a profound and distinct understanding of a certain subject in Germany. As a basis you have to take several subjects in the beginning and this leads after approximately a year to specialization into one subject. A broader knowledge of more academic subjects could have some advantages regarding more flexible and different approaches to solve a problem. However, this leads to a lack of specific details on evaluating complex problems. One might argue that with a greater diversity of subjects there will be more solutions and the person can go into detail if it is required. But this often requires a lot of time and usually companies are not willing to invest more money and additional time in educating their employees. Hence, specialization if chosen in a smart way can give the applicant for example a significant advantage. On the other hand it has to be ensured that cultural understanding and logical thinking trained by mathematical education has been provided. Therefore, schools that host students in Germany for 12 to 13 years are responsible. Education needs a lot of time implying that further unspecialized subjects are being taught at the universities it even takes longer for a student to be prepared forworking autonomously.

For example, If you are in Hangzhou which city is famous for the West Lake, the tour guide will tell you more about resources you can not get from books or theinternet. The second factor that can be seen by every person is that the group travelling will bring you more safety. The guide will tell you which things you can do in the new place according to the local customs, and how to communicate with the local people. Those make you have a peaceful and joyous time. If you are not familiar with this, something unhappy will happen. Furthermore, travelling with a guide can save you time and energy on your journey. As we know, we only have limited time to spend our holiday. We should make good use of our time on our journey. So, company with the tour guide, you will get the most valuable information about where is the best place you have to see, and how to get the convenient way to get there. It gives you the chance to have a wonderful time.

1294,It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.,"I agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to help my opinion. First, ideas and concepts are always the basis of everything when we make a new product or facts. If someone has only a fact, he/she can use that fact but they can't use proper usage of this fact. We can use our facts to know their ideas and concepts. when I was a child, my uncle gave me an airplane paper craft. I can throw it and it will be flying in the air. It was surely interesting and exciting for me but I couldn't understand why it could fly. It is a childish question but I was so serious. So, I learned to know ideas and concepts are so important at that time. In addition, some people feel annoying about facts if they didn't know ideas and concepts. One of my friends will be angry when he can't understand anything. We can say mathematics is also based on ideas and concepts.

First, ideas and concepts are always the basis of everything when we make a new product or facts. If someone has only a fact, he/she can use that fact but they can't use proper usage of this fact. We can use our facts to know their ideas and concepts. when I was a child, my uncle gave me an airplane paper craft. I can throw it and it will be flying in the air. It was surely interesting and exciting for me but I couldn't understand why it could fly. It is a childish question but I was so serious. So, I learned to know ideas and concepts are so important at that time. In addition, some people feel annoying about facts if they didn't know ideas and concepts. One of my friends will be angry when he can't understand anything. We can say mathematics is also based on ideas and concepts.

Now, you get an idea how important cars are for us like legs. We will keep driving cars even in twenty years' time. Secondly, everybody thinks cars are convenient. We can move far away, and we don't need to pay for driving without gas or oil. If a new vehicle or machine is invented in the near future, people might change their way of moving, but this invention must be more convenient and cheaper than cars. In addition to this, this story is not reality, so we should ignore this now.","['I don\'t think that it will decrease the number of cars in just twenty years.

1307,The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,"I am completely positive about the statement. Here i would like to mention some reasons why group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so i guess i confirm the advantages of group travelling. First of all, tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. Group travelling people can defend themselves in difficult times and it is more likely to attract public attention for requesting help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of the high velocity rate. The second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel costs. Needless to say, it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists, not only discounts, but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or a certain number of members. The third reason serves our company's main goal, More people, more fun. It is very interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches and other attractive entertainment. Travelling is not only the meaning of travelling, but of making friends and getting relationships with them. It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way. I know of many occasions when tourists get married after a long, exciting tour.","[""I am completely positive about the statement.
